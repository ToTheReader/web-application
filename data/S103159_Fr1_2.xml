   <head>The Publisher to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>THere comming to my hands (Christian reader) the copie of this treatise following, (wherof many copies have passed abroad in writing) I thought good (weying well the matter vndertaken, &amp; the partie by whom it was written,) to publish the same, to the further view of the world. And chiefly for the good of my country: which all true subiects are bound by all good meanes to seek and advance.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The subiect of this book, or matter undertaken, is; A declaration of th'estate of the Church and Ministery of Engl. compared with</hi> Corah, Dathan, Abiram, <hi>their Tents and conspiracie, against</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Num. 16. chap. <hi>Which therefore all in whom the true fear of God is, ought carefully to look vnto and examine: For we should trie all things, and keep that which is good. And they who never examine the things charged to be evil and out of order in that Church, must needs be ignorant, whether their estate therin be good or evill. But if they cōsider that ignorance will not excuse them, it behooveth all to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: whom I hartely wish to lay aside all partialitie, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different mindes to weigh things well, trying them by the rule of Gods word, that whatsoever therby is required of them, they may resolve to do it; although it turne to the losse of all worldly pleasures and preferments: knowing that we have here but a short time, and our God hath reserved for vs a more induring substance and richer inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, if in obedience we submit vnto him, and in faith and pacience do wayt vpon him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Touching the authour, Mr</hi> Iohn Penry <hi>by name; he was a godly man, learned, zealous, &amp; of a most Christiā cariage &amp; courage: &amp;</hi> (<hi>as he</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">In his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note>
      <hi>saith of himself) borne and bred in the mountaines of Wales. And wel known it is, that with all godly care &amp; labour he endeavoured to have the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached and planted among his poore countrymen, whose case he greatly pittied &amp; had compassion of, in that they wanted the meanes of salvation among them. After all this, God vsing him as a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the more clear manifestation of the truth; he was hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, imprisoned, condemned and executed; &amp; so suffred Martyrdome
<pb facs="3"/>for the name of Christ. Being adiudged at the Kings bench by Sir Iohn Popham Knight, Lord cheif Iustice of England, and the rest of the Iudges there assembled, the 25. of the 5. month called May, and executed at Thomas a Waterings by London, the 29. of the same month, in the year of our Lord, 1593.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And here let the Reader observe, that he was not executed the next day after the iudgement, as it was expected; nor the second, nor third day after; but when men least looked for the same, then was he brought forth being at dynner (as I have heard) by a warrant vnder the hands of the</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Iohn Whitgift.</note>
      <hi>Archbishop of Cāterbury, &amp; of Sir Iohn Puckering Knight, Lord Keeper of the great seale, and Sir Iohn Popham aforesaid, being then Lord chief Iustice of England, and the matter being caried after a close manner, was sodeinly conveyed to the place of execution; where he was as hastily bereaved of his life, and not suffred (though he desired it) to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his faith towards God, or of his allegiance to her Maiestie. Which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ner of dealing I thought good to note here by the way, that it might be knowen, and esteemed of all according as it deserveth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Furthermore concerning this treatise, whether he had finished the whol, or was taken &amp; intercepted, when he had thus far proceeded in it, or what he would further have done about it, I know not. Wherfore if others have more of it, they shall do wel to impart it to the world, as I have done this which came to my hands. In the mean time I wish all to make good vse of this part now printed, &amp; they vnto whose hands it shal come, to enterteyn it as a poore Orphane, who is left as it were Fatherles, by the authours vntimely death, procured by the Prelates: who as vncleane spirits like frogges (croaking about Kings Courts) do stir vp the Magistrates &amp; Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the earth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rev. 16.13.14.</note>
      <hi>to make warre against Gods Saintes. Whereas these should rather hearken to that which God speaketh vnto them in his word saying,</hi> Be wise now therefore, ye Kings: be learned, ye Iudges of the earth: Serve the Lord in feare and rejoyce in trembling: Kisse the sonne, least he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath shall suddenly burne. Blessed are all they that trust in him. <hi>Psal. 2.10.11.12.</hi>
