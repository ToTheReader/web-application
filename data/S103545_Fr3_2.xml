   <head>THE PREFACE TO Ladies, wherein they are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to nurse their Children</hi> themselues.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>VLVS <hi>Gellius</hi> (in my opinion) did not amisse in putting no difference betweene a woman that refuses to nurse her owne childe; and one that kills her child, as soone as shee hath conceiued; that shee may not bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with bearing it nine moneths in her wombe. For why may not a woman with as good reason, deny to nourish her child with her bloud, in her wombe, as to deny it her milke being borne? since the milk is nothing else but bloud whitened, beeing now brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and maturity.</p>
   <p>But some will say that the child may bee deliuered to some other Woman, to nurse it, and that the Mother may haue an eye and care ouer it: But (Gentle Ladies) here I desire you to consider with me the great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that may hence arise, which though they bee infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, yet I will reduce them to foure heads.</p>
   <p>
      <list>
         <item>1. First there is danger least the child be changed and an other put in his place.</item>
         <item>2. Then that naturall affection which should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb facs="139"/>
the mother and the child by this meanes is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished.</item>
         <item>
            <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, it may be feared, that some bad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or inclinations may be deriued from the Nurse into the child.</item>
         <item>
            <hi>4.</hi> And lastly, the Nurse may communicate some imperfection of her body into the child.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> As for the first point, which is the changing of the child, that may easily come to passe; because as soone as the child is borne, and Christned, the Mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently deliuers it to the Nurse, to bee carried into the Country: Where the child, being wholly left to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Nurse, may by some ill chance be stifled, ouer-laid, be let fall, and so come to an vntimely death: or else may be deuoured, spoiled, or disfigured by some wild beast, Wolfe, or Dogge, and then the Nurse fearing to be punished for her negligence, may take another child into the place of it, which can hardly euer be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and distinguished: And indeede when children grow somwhat big, and are brought home from Nurse, if they proue not like their parents in body, in conditions and wit, the Prouerbe goes, <hi>That they are chaunged at Nurse</hi>; Which sometimes may bee truer, then they are aware of.</p>
   <p>The Historiographers report that <hi>Arthebar</hi> King of the Epirotes being old, had one only sonne, whose nurse was corrupted with great gifts to change him, and to take a Gentlemans sonne into his place. But when the King was dead, the Nurse repenting her selfe of this wickednesse, reuealed the error: wherupon ensued such terrible wars, betweene the lawfull and the supposed son, that both of them lost their liues, in a battaile. Vpon
<pb facs="139"/>
this occasion, <hi>Thomistus</hi> the seuenth King of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> leauing two sonnes behind him, when he dyed; the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> chose the younger of them for their King, because he had beene nursed by the Queene his Mother; and reiected the eldest, who had beene brought vp by a strange woman; fearing least he had bene changed by his Nurse.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> For the second point which is naturall affection, without doubt that cannot bee so earnest, either from the Mother toward the child, or from the chlld toward the Mother; if shee haue not nursed him and giuen him sucke. For if she nurse him, he sucks and draws her owne bloud. Whereupon grows a familiar inwardnes, and the child (when he comes to yeares of discretion) finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe bound to his Mother, for many benefits: both in that she hath borne him nine Moneths in her womb, and also because shee hath nursed him, watched him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made him cleane. In recompence whereof, he ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to shew her a thousand delights, to make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or take in good part, so much care and paines, as shee hath taken with him. Hee playes a number of apish trickes about her, he kisseth her, strokes her haire, nose, and eares: he flatters her, he counterfeits anger, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passions, and as he groweth bigger, hee finds other sports with her, which causeth that they beare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such an affection, as cannot be expressed; &amp; makes that they can neuer be parted: When hee is bigge, and comes to be weaned, if one chide his nurse he cries, and stamps: and if one offers to take him out of his nurses armes, he will flye in their faces, and if it were possible, he would euen pull out their heart: and all this proceeds from that inward affection of the child, to which no
<pb facs="140"/>
loue can bee compared. And heereupon <hi>Plato</hi> iustly said, <hi>That children would neuer loue their parents so well; but that their fathers doe often beare them in their armes, and the mothers giue them sucke at their owne breasts.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And heereof wee haue a memorable example in <hi>Cornelius Scipio,</hi> who when he had condemned ten of his most valiant Captaines to death, he would not heare his owne Brother <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> intreating for them, and yet granted their pardon, to one that had bin his Foster-brother, and sucked the same Nurse: which being obiected to him, by his owne Brother, saying; That they had been borne both of one Mother; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd him, That his Nurse-Mother had deserued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, than his owne Mother had done. One of the familie of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> returning from the warre, met his owne Mother, and his Nurse together: but he addressing himselfe, first to his Nurse, presented to her a Girdle of gold, and then to his Mother, a Iewell of of siluer: which she taking indig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ely, and rebuking him with reproaches, he replyed: I know (Mother) that you bore me nine Moneths in your wombe, yet that was out of necessitie, because you could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; but when I was borne, then you forsoke me, and my Nurse-mother willingly intertain'd me, carried me three yeares in her armes, and nourish'd me with her owne bloud.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> As for the maners and conditions of the child, there is no doubt to be made, but that they are better bred and fashioned by the Mother, than by the Nurse. For first, it is deliuered by learned writers, that the Manners and conditions of the mind, do follow the
<pb facs="140"/>
temperament of the bodie, and the temperament ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of the nourishment: so that commonly, such as the humours are, such proue the manners. Hence must we conclude, that the child that suckes a Nurse, that is vitious, and wicked; sucketh also from her, her faults and vices: And beside, when the child comes to vnderstanding, and obserues what the Nurse speakes and doth, he retaines that, saies it after her, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates her: and that which is imprinted from the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, will hardly, or neuer be rooted out. For this cause <hi>Plato</hi> warnes vs, not to speake, or shew any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a child, which is not decent, and honest: and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> forbids, to let a child see any wanton or lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous picture. Then (to returne to our Nurse) we may be assured, that the Milke (wherewith the child is nourish'd two yeares together) hath as much power to make the children like the Nurses, both in bodie, and mind; as the seed of the Parents hath to make the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren like them. For although the child be borne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Parents, neuerthelesse, the bad nurture of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Nurse, will make the child vicious and wicked: For, (as the prouerbe is) <hi>Nurture preuailes more than Nature.</hi> This may be plainly obserued in all things, that haue life: for a faire and flourishing tree, which hath been bred in a good and fat ground, if it be transplanted into a barren ground, becomes a shrub, and beares no fruit, that is good, and tastfull. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the graine that is sowed in good ground, will beare a faire and odoriferous flower; but if it be cast into bad ground, it will bring foorth a bastard flower, without any good or pleasing smell. It is reported, that a certaine child, was nourish'd with the milke of
<pb facs="141"/>
a Bitch: But he would rise in the night and houle with other dogges. <hi>Plato</hi> going about to giue a reason, why <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was so hardy, although he were an Athenian (who naturally were milde and timerous) resolues it thus: because the said <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had been nursed by a Lacedaemonian woman, which is a verie stout, and valiant Nation.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4.</hi> As for the imperfections of the bodie, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may borrow from their Nurses, although they bee very many, yet consider only those, which the corpulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and diseases of the Nurse may bring them. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> writeth, that the Germanes of all other people, are the biggest, and strongest of bodie; and the reason is, because they are nurs'd by their Mothers, which are big of stature. And it is obseru'd, that they which put foorth their children, to women of small stature, haue them, neither so big, nor strong and able of bodie, as if they had brought them vp themselues. If a young Lambe sucke a Goate, it is found by experience, that the wooll of it will be harder, then of other sheepe, and he will prooue more fierce, and wild, then is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for his kind.</p>
   <p>And to this purpose, <hi>Procopius</hi> relates a storie of <hi>Polopeia,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Theseus,</hi> who being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd in secret of a sonne, and desirous to conceal her immodestie, caus'd him to be cast into a forrest, where he being found by a Sheep-heard, was brought vp and nourish'd with Goates milke, (from whence he tooke the name of <hi>Aegistus</hi>) which made him so swift of foot, that eueryone did admire him for his nimblenesse and quicknesse in running.</p>
   <p>Now, concerning the diseases of Nurses, you shall
<pb facs="141"/>
find more of them, polluted and infected with the french Poxes, and other diseases; than sound and healthfull. And I haue knowen Nurses giue little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the French Pockes, who afterwards lying with their owne parents, haue likewise infected them.</p>
   <p>Now what a disgrace, and what a sorrow &amp; griefe of hart, this would be to a Mother, if such a chance should happen, I leaue vnto you (faire Ladies) to iudge.</p>
   <p>And therefore euery Mother should endeauour, by all meanes possible (if she be not sickly, or too tender) to nurse her child her selfe; since that nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd two Paps vpon her, onely for that purpose.</p>
   <p>There are no other Creatures, but giue sucke to their young ones, and if you do but onely make a shew, that you would take them from their dams, what a coyle and stir doe they make? If you carrie them away, they will run after you, and neuer leaue, till you haue let go your hold: desiring rather to loose their owne liues, than suffer their little ones to be carried away.</p>
   <p>And therefore let Mothers neuer put foorth their children to nurse (if they themselues be sound and healthfull) for feare of being chang'd. So shall you be sure, to haue Children, which will honour and loue you, without setling their affections vpon a stranger: Then shall you not need to make any doubt, but that your Children will be vertuous, and honest; not being addicted to any vices, which they may take from their Nurses: and they shall not learne any dishonest, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent speeches; nor heare any thing that shall be either lasciuious, or vnbefitting: then shall you be sure, that your children will be healthfull, since they haue been
<pb facs="142"/>
nourish'd with good milke, and not fed with Apples, Peares, Sops, and such like trash, which is often giuen them, for want of milke. And by this meanes, you shall haue faire and goodly children, well brought vp, docile, vertuous, louing, strong, and lusty, without any diseases: Then shall you be accounted for Mothers indeed, and not Step-Mothers: and therefore neuer make your excuses, that you cannot, nor are not able to endure the trouble, and paines; or that your Husbands will not suffer you to do so.</p>
   <p>And to conclude, I would haue you imitate <hi>Blanche of Castile,</hi> sometimes Queene of France, who nurs'd the King <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Lewes</hi> her sonne her owne selfe; and on a time, as she was out of the way, her child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing froward, a great Ladie of the Court gaue him sucke, to still him, and make him quiet: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Queenes eare, she presently tooke the child, and thrust her finger so far downe into his throat, that she made him vomit vp all the milke, he had suckt of the said Ladie, being very angry that any woman should giue her child sucke, but her selfe.</p>
