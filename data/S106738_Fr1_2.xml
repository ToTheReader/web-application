      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough moste men may vnderstand my purpose, in the description of this monster without farther decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet the Printer doubting least it might seeme obscure to some not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted heretofore with the occasions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of these preset troubles in christendom, at his request I thought good to aduertise thus much. First that the name of the Pope that now last tyrānized was <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> or <hi>Sixtus,</hi> the fift of that name, who being by his seat <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi> (as other Popes his Predecessors were before him and by his sex a man) yet I tearme him by the name of strumpet,
<note place="margin">This prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fulfilled in the time of Pope Ioane, that was a wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table harlot.</note> harlot. &amp;c. as the beloued disciple of our Sauiour doth in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips,</hi> call that man of Sinne, and agreable to that Scripture I bring the diuell in their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, calling him the Queen of new Babilon (the place of his residence.) This Pope to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a most cruel ennemy to humane race, as most his predecessors haue been, though few in so high degree, being no sooner seated in his bloudy seat, he straight beates his braines, how to set al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome together by the eares, partly through the pleasure he taketh in shedding innocēt bloud,
<pb facs="3"/>partly to set himselfe the surer in his <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> chaire, (now almost rotten) and wholly to extinguish and roote out the glorious and moste comfortable Gospell of our Sauiour, with all the professors thereof, that hee might so bring it to passe, that their might be no memorie remaining of the one nor the other. And because the diuell is alwaies ready at our elbowe to pricke vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as soone as we haue conceiued any euill in our harts, and so much the readier, by how much the conceiued mischief is the greater. So no doubt this Pope, whose conceit being against Christ &amp; his members, I accōpt the chiefest of al sins, what so euer, had no sooner laid the plot of his vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mischief in his hart, but the diuil was as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gēt to vrge him to put it in as spedy practise. And therefore Isay this monster or bloudy league, to be begotten of the diuel vpō the forenamed whor of Rome, as who so loketh wel into the nature of the said Holy league, must needes say with mee, that Hel it self was of coūsail to the establishing thereof. I tearme it vntimely birth, in respect of the strumpets eagernes in bringing it forth, for she brought forth her mishapen creature after her comming to the Popedome, in halfe the time
<pb facs="3"/>that women commonly vse to go with child, euen within the compas of four moneths: yet the bug shewed not himselfe in his iollity till the year <hi>88.</hi> the cause wherof liudge to be a certain prophesy inuented amongst the Papists, that in the saide yeare of <hi>88.</hi> there should be but one king, one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and one flocke, the interpretation whereof they apply, the King, to be Phillip of Spayn, the pastor to be the Pope, and the flocke to be al peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations of our Europe, which in that year should all be thrall and slaues to that king &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. Yet note by the way, friendly Reader, that this great pastor, that wold haue so great a flock or rather the fleece and fel of them, &amp; that now vanteth to excell all kings, as much as the Sunne excelleth the Moone, was of late a begging gray fryer,
<note place="margin">The Franciseā Friers when they begge at the dore, they aske it for and in the name of Saint Francis himselfe.</note> going frō dore to dore with a wallet on his backe, begging bread for S. Frauncis, but that begging estate he hath as clean forgotten now, as though his feete now cladde with purple veluet shoes, had neuer gone bare foote.</p>
   <p>The king of Spayn, so inriched by his west <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Mines</hi> &amp; his reuenews so increased through his late vsurping of Portingall, and thereby also the east <hi>India,</hi> being the chief piller of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="4"/>and without whom it could neuer haue stoode so long, I place him for the monsters right arme, in whome the Pope puts all his confidence, they two hang together as the pennard and inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne, the Pope giues the king many buls, which yeelds great profite to his coffers, therefore the king is his chāpion and generall in al his battails, yet note, those fat buls come not out of the Popes medowes, he giues him but a pig of his owne sow, the Popes gift is but yearly a sheete of paper, but all the profite that comes to the king, comes from his subiects purses, and so drunken is this king becom with the winelees of this harlots goldē cup that he cannot discern it. The late duke of Guise sometime, in respect of his bloudy mind, the fittest man in our Europe, to haue a principall place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Popes own children, he being cōmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cald the Popes butcher, is plaste as the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters left arm which arme a long time was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feared of al men, til it pleased the Lord to sett his church free from so cruel a scourge. I describe the monstar first, as he was in his greatest pride, but after according to his present picture, I des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe him as he lately was. I doubt not but the rest may be well vnderstoode. Farewell.</p>
