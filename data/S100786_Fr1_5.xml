   <p>BEfore the gratious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God, had created

all seedes vnsought. (To conclude) all
natures benefites (that nowe so ofte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
and keepe mans healthful state fri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hurt)
lay hugely heaped in the boisterous
<pb facs="12"/>
bowels of confused <hi>Chaos,</hi> distaunt from
light, absent from knowledge, and farre
from doing good. Whiche nowe (being
brought to light by the same almightie
his prouidence) not only ministreth helth
to the sicke, ease to the painfull, pleasure
to the sorrowfull, &amp; health to the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but ofttimes as we dailie proue (euē
by fine force) encountreth the merciles
might of fell disseases, and preuenteth the
dreadful dartes of death (whilest the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
only haue her in vse. But as enuie
that subtile Serpent hateth all vertue,
contemneth all good thinges, and spiteth
the prosperous successe of famous scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
so hath she of late procured and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> suche a sort of beastlye abusers, or
diuelishe dissemblers, as (studie onlye to
deceiue the worlde) inuente willingly to
embase the worthy arte, and seke shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to slaūder the godly studentes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
As it is not vnknowen vnto you (ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needeles for me to tell) howe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
and Chyrurgerie haue in time past
bene renowmed throughout the worlde:
No more is it to you ignoraunt, how litle
it is in these dayes regarded, which if we
<pb facs="13"/>
compare time present with that is past,
we shall see and plainely perceiue it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
despised (as needles) then regarded
as necessarie, such slender iudgement and
fond affection raigneth at this daye, and
so is the worlde vpside down turned: that
what so afore time hath ben best accōpted
of, the same is now the basest, that which
was principall, is (at this time) y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> poorest,
and the chiefest become lest estemed. In
this case (therefore) as I must needes
blame the fickle state of the worlde and
moste of al accuse the fraile estate of mās
nature (I meane the cōmon sorte of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are always readie to turne with
euerie blast of <hi>Eolus</hi> wauering wynde
without stedfastnes or consideration of
righteous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>causes) So can I not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excuse thē, vnto whom authoritie is
geuen, to establishe orders and reforme
malefactours with the causes of offence,
whose onely slacknes, and vntimely cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
is the greatest encouragement
that offenders haue. I speake not this as
seeming to cōtroll your worships (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you will rightly conceiue, it cōmeth
of a zelous harte) but if the loue of oure
coūtrie, &amp; eminent desolatiō (which might
<pb facs="13"/>
happē by want of this arte) doe not draw
vs all hereunto, yet (at the least, if wee
loue our selues) we are forste to crie out
vpon abuses, deplore double dealing, and
seke for spedie reformation. Uerie harde
it were for suche a rowte of Rogishe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
so boldly to practise, and to fill all
places with the slaunderous shauinges
of their deuelishe practises, were they not
permitted of some (in authoritie) &amp; win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at of suche as should them punishe.
I doe not a litle marueile also, howe and
by what meanes or merit, so many gette
their authorities or licenses to practise,
when as in examination they (not onlye)
shewe them selues ignoraunt Asses, and
in their workes bussardly beyardes, but
also of them selues altogether disposed to
incontinencie, and dayly dissimulation,
without either feare of God, or obediēce
to their Prince, I (my self) knowe them
at this daie, the moste beastly deceiuers,
and licentious liuers that euer profest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
arte, (hauing neither knowledge, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie,
nor honestie, and yet practise their
accustomed deceites, vnder the colour of
admittaunce frō our hal, being (in deede)
farre fitter for the cart thē Chyrurgerie.

Smally shall it auaile y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> learned to take

their poopishe pleasures, accompting the

therefore your worshippes woulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
