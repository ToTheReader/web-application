   <head>¶ To him that readeth, and <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth, longe life and glory,</hi> in the Lorde Christe.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> I is a spéech receiued commonly among men, that rare things, should be deare thinges: and those that bée knowne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, they bee spewed out, and layed aside very scornfully: The reporte of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first, when I first tooke this in hande cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled mee to lay aside my Paper and my Inke, and betake my selfe to other exercise: The tryall in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shut vp all hope that I had, if hee that ruleth the actions of men, as I did know and am assured, coulde not also despose the hart and secrete cogitations of all flesh: Therfore the prayer of the Lorde, though it be generally taught of all, and thought to bee as base and homly ware, such as euery poore man lyinge tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his ragges, and the base husbandman in the feeld is content to vse (for this their sakes also in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte) yet when I gaue my selfe to the looking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I found a greate deale more Maiesty therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, then any one earthly creature can comprise: As for the notable and famous men of late memorie: displaying their Insignes so gloriously in the sight of men, shewinge vs how to war, and to pight battayle with the world and the diuel: how to pray, to whom, wherfore, and for what causes: with other artillery and goodly furniture belonginge therunto, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth those that will know the Lorde: yet I can not say, though they played their partes very conningly, and writ very subtellye, and comprehended all that they did artificially: that therfore they swalowed vp whole multitudes of such as succéeded them: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ireneus</hi> stayed, because that the fathers which
<pb facs="5"/>went before him, knewe the Lorde: neyther <hi>Origen</hi> kepte backe his hand, or lefte his pen, or dispised la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, albeit, the matters hee tooke vpon him, were described of others: And as for those succéeded them, eyther faltered they in their spéech, or swounded they in common talke, or did they fall, because Cirill, or <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> or <hi>Crysostom,</hi> or <hi>Ambrose,</hi> plentifully, and verye faythfully with great zeale and singuler trauayle, painted forth the dealing and conuersatiō of the men that liued then? I say naye: but those flowing wits, did leaue behind them a gret light to their posteritie, and they that came after, sucked out the Marrow and the strength, and robbed their Progenitors: and after that, became as mighty in their laboures, &amp; as valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt in their wrightinges, and as pleasaunt in their tongue and language, as the most renowmed men of them that liued in former ages: And that I can sée, or may iudge as yet, our time hath bin as well blessed with flourishinge wittes, and our men that now liue garnished with so great knowledge, as I doo, and dare incourage them al that loue the Lord, to procéed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in their callinges: in as mutch as both our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, haue not stolne away all cōmendation from vs that follow them: neyther we shut vp into so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a roome, but that in the light and beauty of the dayes wherin wée bée, wee may amonge many good and excellent writers, say something: To him that looketh for the first place, it is good to contente him with the second or the thirde degrée: For him that gapeth to contend for the rest, if hée wilbe aduertised by mée, hée shall thinke himselfe well, if hée can haue place with the hindermost. So that great thinges shall not dismaye, the weake: and simple men shall stande by the best: But if any one pleased with his condition, can kéepe a meane, that is hée, that shall haue the commendation from them bothe: As for
<pb facs="5"/>this my trauaile, and first byrth (as it were) pained so mutch the more, as I desire earnestly the Church of the Lorde God should inioy it: séeing it is my first Babe, I willingly offer him vnto you all to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: and this Booke I giue it the rather to young men, as I my selfe am but growing vp, and attende the good leysure of the Lorde, that can increase and strengthen mee, and bringe mee vp to greater sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</p>
   <p>For any fine and conninge feature you shall finde herein, I dare not promise so much as any iot therof: but as be the bookes of Deuines, commonly talkinge to common men, laying out the plainenes and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the people, such is this that I giue vnto you: If any question with mee for the matter, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce therin contayned: let him not thinke hee is in the Goldsmithes shop: hée wilbe content, when hée hath red so much as I haue doone, and séene the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the worlde as all may doo that liue nowe, to bestow himselfe in some more homely trade a greate deale: Yet I will say something vnto him: please it him to enter in to sée what ware I haue, and wil he vouchsafe to reade ouer this worke of mine: hee shall finde, though an vnskilfull Artificer meddeleth with it, yet so much both of housholde stuffe, and other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture (if hée can place it well) and bestowe it in his house: as is able to suffise the best learned man that I knowe, to stop vp more then one creuice or two in his study. Neyther can I see, if so bee this worke were taken in hand by any other learned and skilfull in iudgement: but that hee whiche looketh on it, might receiue greate comfort, and singuler pleasure in the same: Consideringe that hee looketh vpon the Lorde God, and talketh familiarly with Christe, and is bolde to presente him selfe beefore Aungelles and powres, and prayeth for his Bretheren, and is harde
<pb facs="6"/>of so good and gratious a Lorde, as our God is: That giueth when hée asketh, openeth when hée knocketh, bestoweth when hée demaundeth, that shal feare him and call on his name faythfully: Also whosoeuer bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his Marchandrise, and vseth it well to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lorde, and profitinge himselfe with others: hée layeth not vp treasure that is to be taken frō him, but caryeth it with him vnto Heauen, and it lyeth by him for euer: And amonge all the thinges pretious and excellent that I haue seene on earth, neuer tooke I more comforte in any one then this: that the glory of the Lorde, and the sweetnes of his worde, and this helpe wherin by prayer I haue all that is necessary both heauenly and terrestriall: tittelled mee from time to time, till I had inioyed them: of trueth, neuer rauished with any pleasure of man so much, as of late in the meditation, and heauenly spéeche that I had, when I questioned too and froe with the Lorde God, what it was hée would haue his people and poore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely that pineth away in this world, to looke vpon: From whom I receiued this message: that séeynge it pleased him to make choyse of the sonnes of men, and to take vnto him those that he loued in this life, they ought therfore to disioyne themselues, and forsake the company of vnbeléeuers, praying for and meditating heauenly thinges, castinge vp their mindes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and reposinge their hope on the God of glorye, that hath giuen vnto vs his liuery and his colyzen to bee knowne as his Seruauntes, euen by prayer and earnest inuocation vpon his name, the order &amp; frame wherof, I haue largely set downe in my first Booke: After this, that no man bee excusable, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande so mutch as is set downe by the Lorde: when anye one shall come beefore him, that hee may not speake vnknowne thinges, or praye when hée vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not: or vtter that hee knoweth not: or powre
<pb facs="6"/>out before God and his Aungelles, and all the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company and assembly of Sainctes, vnaduisedly that which hee regardeth not: for this cause haue I vnfolded the darkenesse of speeche, and layde open to euery Babe if so hee can reade the wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe set downe by him in the eleuenth of <hi>Luke:</hi> all which you shall finde layd on a heape, and knitte vp togeather in my second Booke. Of those that come betwixt, eyther precepts, eyther rules, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exhortations, eyther demaundes, eyther things that bee amisse, eyther such as bee well, eyther life, cyther dealinges and demeanor of men, that shewe themselues in their proper places: them I exhorte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, to take priuatly vnto him, not to vse them as common vnto all: As concerning my iudgement indiuers poinctes of Religion, and called in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy by men of our time, I haue looked at them, hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led them I haue not: to the decidinge of them I haue selected out an other time, and another place, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge if so God will, to call you or it be longe, and to craue your councell in the same: that if so you will paciently beare with mee in this my first request, I will bee tyed vnto you, and owe my seruice in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and as you may see: that wherin I haue béene practised, and wherunto, I haue indeuored my selfe from my Cradle, according to that haue I giuen the name of this Boke: No other thinge in deede then the exercise of my youth: &amp; deliuered vp to all young ones, to looke vpon: Contente to leaue my title therin, neyther will I claime any thing from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth in the same, they may chalenge it, by good right to their owne vse: And if the rancknes of other men, haue taken away all the glorie that I hoped for: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire &amp; pray you al to content you with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> little that I haue: If you think good to leaue vnto me any time at al, to turne y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ouer few leaues that I offer you: if any
<pb facs="7"/>labour of youres come vnto my hands, like fauor will I shew them: &amp; the good that I can doo, they shalbe assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of: As for the learned that did manifeste them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you before, in a better and perfecter stile, then I haue wrot: Them (if so they liued) I durst intreat: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Maister <hi>Bucer,</hi> or Maister <hi>Martir,</hi> or Maister <hi>Caluin:</hi> or any other the honorable company, to beare with mée in that I do: both for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> their traficke &amp; their toyle they tooke, was not extinguished by other mens trauayle: and in that they purposed not, by the large streames wherin they were busied, to stop vp the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and small chanels of other mennes study: Bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge my request to them shall reade this Booke: that they waye all thinges as they bee set downe, that they cast not their eyes vpon other men: To whom and that doo feare the Lorde, and wish for peace and quietnesse to his Churche, and readeth diligently to follow it reuerently, or iudge Christianly, and séeke Gods glory faythfully: bee health, rest, and honor for euermore. <hi>Fare you well.</hi>
