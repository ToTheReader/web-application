      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He famous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Plato</hi> besought of all his Disciples to tell them, why he iournyed so oft frō <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Scicile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way hee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled (indeed) very long, and the sea he passed very dangerous: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them thus.

   <p>I let you vnderstand my Disciples, that a good Philosopher, to visite and helpe his friend, and to accompany with a good man, should thinke the iourney short, and no whit painefull, though he should sulke the whole seas <note place="margin">The paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iourney the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers booke to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

   <p>
      <hi>Agesilaus</hi> also among the Greekes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a worthy Captaine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the King <hi>Hicarius</hi> had another Captaine (his very friende) Captiue: leauing all his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres apart, trauelling through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Countries, went to the place, whete hee was, and arriued there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himselfe vnto the King, and sayde thus vnto him.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I humbly beseech thee, O puissant King, that thou vouchsafe to pardon</hi> Minotus <hi>my sole and onely friend, and thy subiect now: for what thou shalt doe to him, make thy account thou hast done it to me: For in deed thou canst neuer alone punish his body, but thou shalt therewith also crucifie my heart.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>King <hi>Herod</hi> after <hi>Augustus</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome <hi>Marke Antonie,</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and laying his Crowne at the Emperiall foote, with stout courage spake these words vnto him. <hi>Know thou, mighty</hi> Augustus, <hi>if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est it not, that if</hi> Marke Antony <hi>had beleeued mee, and not his accursed</hi>
      <pb n="564" facs="302"/>
      <hi>loue</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>thou shouldest then haue proued how bitter an enemy I would haue beene to thee, and hee haue found how true a friend I was, and yet am to him. But hee, as a man rather gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to the rule of a womans will, then guided by reasons skill, tooke of me but money onely, and of</hi> Cleopatra <hi>coonsell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And proceeding further, sayde, <hi>Loe here my kingdome, my person, and royal crowne layde at thy princely feet, all which I freely offer to thee, to dispose of at thy will and pleasure, pleasing thee so to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, but yet with this condition</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict Augustus) <hi>that thou commaund mee not to heare, nor speake ill of</hi> Marke Antony <hi>my Lord and friend, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were now dead. For know thou, sacred Prince, that true friendes neyther for death ought to bee had in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion, nor for absence to be forsaken.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> last Dictator and first Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> did so entirely loue <hi>Cornelins Fabatus</hi> the Consull, that trauelling together through the Alpes of <hi>France,</hi> and beeing benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a true friende.</note> farre from any towne or harbor, saue that only of a hollow caue, which happily they lighted on: And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Consull, euen then not well at ease, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> left him the whole caue, to the end he might bee more at rest, and he himselfe lay abroad in the cold and snow.</p>
   <p>By these godly examples we haue recited, and by diuers others wee could recite, may bee considered, what faithfull friendshippe ought to be betwixt true and perfect friendes, &amp; into how many dangers one friend ought to put himselfe for another: for it is not enough, that one friend be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the troubles of another, but hee is bound (if neede were) to goe and dye ioyfully with him.</p>
   <p>He onely, deseruedly, may bee counted a true friend, that vnasked, and before hee bee called, goeth with his goods and person to helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his friend. But in this our y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron age, alas, there is no such kinde of amity, as that wee haue spoken of. More then this, that there is no friend will part with any thing of his to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his friend, much lesse that taketh care to fauour him in his troubles: but if there be any such that will helpe his friend, it is euen then when time ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth rather to pitty and lament him, then to ayde or succour him.</p>
   <p>It is a thing worth the knowledge, that to make a true and perpetuall friendshippe, we may not offer to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons, but according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> his saying, who saith: <hi>My friend</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillus, <hi>I counsell thee that thou be a true friend to one alone, and enemy to none: for numbers of friends brings great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, which seemeth somewhat to diminish friendship:</hi> For who that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth the liberty of the heart, it is vnpossible that one should frame and agree with the conditions of many, &amp; much lesse that many should content them with the desires and affections of one.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Salust</hi> were two famous Orators amongst the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and great enemies betweene themselues, and during this emulation betweene them. <hi>Tully</hi> had purchased all the Senators friendshippe, and <hi>Salust</hi> onely had no other friend in all <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Marke Antony</hi> alone,</p>
   <p>And so these two great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors beeing one day at words toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Tully</hi> in great anger sayde to <hi>Salust: What force or power art thou of, or what euill canst thou doe or attempte against mee? sith thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that in all</hi> Rome <hi>thou hast but one onely friend,</hi> Marke Antony, <hi>and I no enemie but one, and that is he?</hi> To whom <hi>Salust</hi> answered:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thou gloriest</hi> (O Tully) <hi>that thou hast no moe but one onely enemy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards iests at mee, that I haue no</hi>
      <pb n="565" facs="302"/>
      <hi>more Friends but onely me: but I hope in the immortall Gods, that this onely Enemie thou hast, shall bee able enough vtterly to vndoe thee: and this my sole Friend that I haue, shall bee sufficient to protect and defende mee in all my cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And shortly after these words pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betweene tham, <hi>Marke Anthonie</hi> shewed the friendship hee bare to the one, and the enmitie hee had to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, he caused <hi>Tullie</hi> to be put to death, and raysed <hi>Salust</hi> to great honour.</p>
   <p>A Friend may well imparte to the other, all his owne, as bread, wine, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, time, conuersation, and such like, but hee cannot notwithstanding giue him part of his heart: for that suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not to be parted nor deuided, because it cā be giuē but to one alone.</p>
   <p>This graunted to bee true, as needs it must, doubtles that the heart cannot bee deuided, but onely giuen to one: then is it of necessitie, that hee that will seeke to haue many Friends, must needs repaire to the shambles to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide him of many hearts.</p>
   <p>Many vaunt themselues, and thinke it a glory to haue numbers of friends, but let such well consider to what vse that legendarie of Friendes doe serue them, they shall then easily finde they stand them in no oeher steede, but to eate, to drinke, to walke, to babble, and to murmure togethers, and not one to helpe the other, with their goods, fauour, and credite at their neede, nor friendly to reprooue them of theyr faults and vices, which doubtles ought not to bee so.</p>
   <p>For, where true and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship raigneth, neyther I with my friend, nor hee with mee should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble any vice of faulte.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ouide</hi> sayth in his booke <hi>De Arte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi> that the law of true and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Loue</hi> is so streight, that no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but mine in thy heart should har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and in mine should lodge none others loue but thine, for loue is none <note place="margin">What Loue is.</note> other thing, <hi>But one heart, liuining in two bodyes, and two bodyes obeying in one heart.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In this World there is no treasure comparable to a true and sure Friend, sith to a faithfull▪ Friende a man may safely discouer the secrets of his heart, bewray vnto him his gryping griefes, trusting him with his honour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his guyde and custodie all his goods, hee shall succour him in his miserie, counsell him in perill, reioyce at his prosperitie, and mourne at his aduersitie: And in fine I conclude, such a friend neuer wearyeth to serue him in his life, nor to lament him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</p>
   <p>I graunt that Golde and Siluer is good, Kinsefolkes are good, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is good: but true friends exceede them all without comparison.</p>
   <p>For all these things cannot warrant vs from necessitie (if sinister <hi>Fortune</hi> plunge vs into it) but rather encrease our torments and extreamitie. Also they doe not reioyce vs, but rather heape further griefes vpon vs: neither doe they succour vs, but rather eache houre giue vs cause to complaine, and much lesse do they remember and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise vs of that that is good, but still doe deceyue vs, not directing vs the right way, but still bringing vs out of our way: and when they haue led vs awry out of the High-way, they bring vs into Desart woods, and high, and dangerous mountaines, whence from we must fall downe headlong.</p>
   <p>A true friend is no partaker of these conditions, but rather hee is sorry for the least trouble that happeneth to his friend, hee feareth not, neither spareth his goods, nor the daunger of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he careth not to take vpon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny painfull iourney, quarrels, or sutes, nor yet to put his life in euery hazard of death.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="566" facs="303"/>
And yet that that is most of all to bee esteemed is, that like as the heart and bowels euer burne with pure and sincere loue, so doth hee wish and desire with gladsome mind to beare the burthen of all his friends mishaps, yea more then yet is spoken of.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, offered great presents to the Philosopher <hi>Zenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who would not vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue them, much lesse to beholde them. And beeing demaunded of <hi>Alexander,</hi> why he would not receyue them, hauing poore kinsfolkes and parents to bestow them on: hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him thus.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Truely, I haue both brothers and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> (O Alexander) <hi>yet I haue no kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but him that is my friend, and one onely friend I haue, who hath no need of</hi>
      <note place="margin">A remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able saying of Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</note>
      <hi>any gifts to bee giuen him. For the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause why I chose him to be my sole and only friend, was for that I euer saw him spise these worldly things.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Truly the sentence of this good Philosopher <hi>Zenocrates</hi> is of no small efficacy for him that will aduisedly consider of it, sith that not seldome, but many times it happeneth, that the great troubles, the sundry dangers, &amp; the continuall necessities and miseries wee suffer in this vale of misery, haue for the most part procceded from our parents, and afterwards by our friends haue beene mediated and redressed. Therefore since wee haue thought it good and necessary to chose a friend, and that hee bee but one onely, each man must bee wise, lest in such choise hee be deceyued. For oft times it happeneth, that those that take little regarde herein, grant their friendship to such a one as is too couetous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, a great babler, seditious, and presumptuous, and of such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that sometimes it should be lesse euill for vs to haue him our enemie, then to account of him as of our deer friend.</p>
   <p>Him whom wee will chuse for our faithfull friend, amongst other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions, hee must chiefly, and before all bee indued with these, <note place="margin">Great eate is to bee had in choosing a friend.</note> that he be courteous of nature, fayre spoken, hard and stout to indure pain, patient in troubles, sober in diet, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his words, graue and ripe in his counsels, and aboue all stedfast in friendshippe, and faithfull in secrets: And whom wee shall find with these laudable vertues and conditions ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, him may wee safely take and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for our friend. But if wee see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these parts wanting in him, wee ought to shun him, as from the plague knowing for certainety, that the friendshippe of a fayned and fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call friend is much worse and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, then the enmity of a knowne and open enemy: for to the hands of one wee commit our heart and faith, and from the deceites and treasons of the other wee defend our selues with our whole force and power.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Seneca</hi> writing to his deere and faithfull friend <hi>Lucillus</hi> sayeth vnto him. I pray thee (O <hi>Lucillus)</hi> that thou order and determine thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres by the aduice and counsell of thy friend, but also I doe remember thee: that first thou see well what manner of friend thou hast chosen thee: for there is no marchandise in the world this day, that men are so soone beguiled in, as they are in the choise of friends. Therfore the graue sentence of <hi>Seneca</hi> wisely wayed, wee should assent with him in opinion, that sith no man buyeth a Horse, but hee first causeth him to bee rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, nor bread, but first hee seeth and handleth it, nor wine but hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth it, nor flesh but first he wayeth it, nor corne but hee seeth a sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor house but hee doth first va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it, nor Instrument but that first hee playeth on it, and iudgeth of his sound: It is but reason hee
<pb n="571" facs="303"/>
should be so much the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect before hee choose his Friend to examine his life and condition, since all the other things wee haue spoken of, may bee put in diuers houses and corners, but our Friend we lodge and keepe deerely in our proper be wells.</p>
   <p>Those that write of the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> say, that he was very strange and scrupulous in accepting Friends, but after hee had once receyued them into his friendship, hee was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and circumspect to keepe them. For hee neuer had any friend, but first he had some proofe and tryall of him, neyther would hee euer after forsake him, for any displeasure done to him. Therefore it shold alwayes be so, that true friends should beare one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such loue and affection, that the one beeing in prosperitie, should not haue occasion to complaine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in that hee did not relieue his friends necessitie, being in aduersitie: nor the other being poore and needy, should grudge or lament for that his friend being rich and wealthie, would not succour him, with all that hee might haue done for him. For to say the trueth, where perfect friendship is, there ought no excuse to be made, to doe what possible is, the one for the other.</p>
   <p>The friendship of young men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth commonly (or for the most part at the least) by beeing companions in vice and follie: and such of right ought rather to be called vacabonds, then once to deserue the name of true friends. For, that cannot bee called true friendship, that is continued to the preiudice or derogation of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Seneca</hi> writing againe to <hi>Lucillus,</hi> saith these words. I would not haue thee thinke, nor once mistrust, O my <hi>Lucillus,</hi> that in all the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire I haue any greater Friende then thuo: but with all, assure thy selfe, that our Friendship is not so straight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vs, that I would take vpon mee at any time to doe for thee otherwise then honesty should lead mee.</p>
   <p>For though that loue I beare thee, <note place="margin">The saying of Seneca, touching frindship.</note> hath made thee Lord of my libertie: yet reason also hath left mee vertue free.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The Authour proceedeth on.</head>
      <p>Applying that wee haue spoken, to that wee will now declare, I say I will not acknowledge my selfe your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, for so should I bee compelled to feare you more then loue you: much lesse will I vaunt my selfe to bee your Kins-man: for so I should impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and displease you: and I will not brag that heretofore wee haue beene of familiar acquaintaunce, for that I would not make any demonstration, I made so little account of you, and lesse then I am bound to doe: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I boaste my selfe that I am at this present your familiar and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued: For indeed I should then shew my selfe to bee too bolde and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant: but that, that I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, shall be, that I loue you as a Friend, and you mee as a Kins-man, albeeit this friendship hath succeeded diuersly till now. For you being No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as you are, haue bountifully shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your friendship to mee, in large and ample gifts: but I poore, and of base estate, haue onely <hi>made you sure of mine in wordes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his politikes sayd: That it were far better to fell to our friends our workes and good deedes, whether they were (in prosperitie, aduersitie, or necessitie) then to feede them with vaine <hi>Flattering wordes for nothing:</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Yet it is not so generall a rule, but that sometimes it happeneth, that the loftie and high words on the one side are so profitable, and the workes so few and feeble, on the other side, that
<pb n="572" facs="304"/>
one shal be better pleased and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with hearing the sweete and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous wordes of the one, then he shall be, to be serued with the colde seruice and workes of the other, of small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and value.</p>

         <hi>Plutarche</hi> also in his booke <hi>De ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malibus</hi> telleth vs: that <hi>Denis</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant beeing one day at the Table, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of diuers and sundrie matters with <hi>Chrysippus</hi> the Phylosopher, it chaunced, that as hee was at dinner, one brought him a present of certaine Sugar-cakes: wherefore <hi>Chrysippus</hi> ceasing his former discourse, fell to perswade <hi>Denis</hi> to fall to his cakes. To whome <hi>Denis</hi> aunswered, on with your matter <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> and leaue not off so: For my heart is better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thy sweete and sugred wordes, then my Tongue is pleased with the delicate taste of these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-cakes. For as thou knowest, these cakes are heauie of digestion, and doe greatly annoy the stomack: but good <note place="margin">Good workes doe maruellous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheare the heart.</note> workes doe meruellously reioyce and comfort the heart.</p>
      <p>For this cause <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had the poet <hi>Homer</hi> in greater venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (beeing dead) then all the other that were aliue in his time: not for that <hi>Homer</hi> euer did him seruice, or that hee knew him, but onely because of his learned Bookes hee wrote and compiled: and for the graue senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he found therein. And therefore he bare about him in the day time the booke of the famous deedes of <hi>Troy,</hi> (called the <hi>Illyades)</hi> hanged at his neck within his bosome: and in the night hee layde it vnder his bolster, at his beds-head where hee slept.</p>
      <p>In recompence therefore (Syr) of the many good turnes I haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at your hands, I was also willing to compyle and dedicate this my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Treatise to you, the which I present you with all my desires, my studyes, my watches, my sweatte, and my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, holding my selfe fully satisfyed for all the paines I haue taken, so that this my simple trauell be gratefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (to whom I offer it) and to the publike weale profitable. Being well assured, if it please you to trust me and credite my wryting, you shall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly know how freely I spake to you, and like a friend, and not deceyue you as a flatterer.</p>
      <p>For, if the beloued and Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Princes, chaunce to bee cast out of fauour, it is because euery man flattereth him, and seeketh to please him, and no man goeth about to tell him trueth: nor that, that is for his honour, and fittest for him.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Salust</hi> in his booke of the warres of <hi>Iugurtha</hi> sayth: that the high heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call facts and deedes were of no lesse glorie to the Hystoriographers that wrote them, then they were to the captaine that did them.</p>
      <p>For it happeneth many times, that the Captaine dying in the battell hee hath wonne, liueth afterwardes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, by the Fame of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempt: And this proceedeth not only of the valiant deeds of Arms he was seene doe, but also for that wee read of him in worthy Authors which haue written thereof.</p>
      <p>Wee may well say therefore (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter) that as well may wee take him for a true friend, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth good counsell, as hee which doeth vs great pleasure and seruice. For according to the opinion of the good Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who who saide to his Secretarie <hi>Panutius,</hi> that a man with one pay, may make full satisfaction and recompence of many pleasures and good turns shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but to requite a good counsell, diuers thankes, and infinite seruices are requisite.</p>
      <p>If we will credite the ancient Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers, wee shall finde it true, that the most Noblest and vertuous

Emperours, the fortunate Kings, and the valiant Captaines, when they should enterprise to go conquer their enemies, eyther they sought for some Philosopher, or they chose some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honest learned man, of whome they tooke counsell touching all their affayres, before they prest any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
      <p>Comparing the times past, with <note place="margin">The times past better then the times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> the times present, wee thinke (that haue read somewhat) that the time past was as pure graine, and this now as chaffe and straw: that one as the time calme, and still in the sea, and this as wauering and tempestuous: that then the fine and pure mertal, and this now the drosse thereof. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the marie, and this the bones: the one the cleare day, and the other the darke night. For in these dayes, in Princes Courts, and noble mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they glory more to haue a scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing knaue or iester to make them laugh, then they reckon of a graue and wise man to giue them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in all his wars would alwayes be accompanied with the wise <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with the Philosopher <hi>Chilo:</hi> King <hi>Ptholomie,</hi> with <hi>Pithinns</hi> the Philosopher: <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> King of <hi>Epyre,</hi> with <hi>Zatirus, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> the Emperour with <hi>Simonides: Scipio</hi> the African with <hi>Sophocles, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> the Emperour with <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour with <hi>Gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> Now all these famous Princes carried not with them so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Philosophers, to fight in battell with armed weapon in hand like other their Souldiers, but onely to vse their counsell and aduise: so that the great battels they ouerthrew, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy victories they wan, with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble triumphes done, was as much by the graue counsell of these good and wise Philosophers, as by the force of their army, and prowes of their captaines.</p>
      <p>The greatest good turne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit one friend can doe for another, is to know to giue good counsell to his friend in his greatest neede: and not without cause, I say, to giue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: For it happeneth oft times, that those that thought to haue giuen vs good remedy by their counsell, (wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting indeed discretion &amp; iudgement in the same) haue caused vs to runne into further dangers.</p>
      <p>And therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> beeing once demaunded of the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> what he thought of <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, aunswered him in this manner.</p>
      <p>I thinke it was as necessary that <hi>Cato</hi> was borne for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as <hi>Scipio</hi> for the warres, for the good <hi>Cato</hi> with his prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell expelled vice out of the Weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike: and the other with his noble courage and great armies did euer withstand the force of the enemies:</p>
      <p>According to the saying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> let vs also say after him, that hee is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry arrogant that presumes to giue an other counsell; but withall, wee say againe, that if the counsell be found good, hee hath giuen to his friend in his need and necessity, as much praise deserueth he that gaue it, as he that knew how to take it.</p>
      <p>Now after the example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philosophers, which went to the warres, not to fight, but onely to giue counsell, I will (sir) for those things that pertaine to your seruice, and profite, take vpon mee the office of a Philosopher; and for the first do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of my Philosophie, I say, that if it please you, to receiue these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which my penne doth write vnto you, at this present. I promise you, &amp; by the faith of a Christian man, I sweare, that they shall bee such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent helpes to you, for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="574" facs="305"/>
of your credite and fauour you are now in, as you may bee enriched by the true and diligent seruice of your seruants For if a man woulde with an oath aske the truth of <hi>Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Chilo, Pittachus,</hi> and of <hi>Apolonius:</hi> and also of all the vniuersity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the other Philosophers, they would sweare and affirme, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of man consisteth not in great might, in great authority, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: but onely in deseruing much: For the honor, fauour, and digniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this mortall life, are more to be praysed, and had in veneration, when they are placed in a condigne &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy person, then they are being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of an vnworthy and gracelesse man, allotted to him, not by vertue, but by fortune: And therefore your authority being great at this present, exalted thereto by Gods diuine will and prouidence, and now in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of prosperity: I would wish you, my good Lord, lesse then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courtier, to trust to fortunes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: For if the earthquakes sooner bring to ground the proud and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pallaces, then the meane and lowe houses: if ofter fall the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, the dreadfull lightnings, and tempests, then on the lowest hilles: if among the greater multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the plagues be rifer, then amongst the fewer number: if they vse rather to spread their nets, and lay the bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime on the greene and thickest bows then on the drye and withered sticks: to snare the seely birds withall: If al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the stillest seas doe foreshew to vs a greater tempest following, and if that long health bee a watch vnto a great and dangerous sicknesse ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: by this also I will infer, that those that are atchieued to sublime estate, and high degree, are commonly more subiect to fall, then those of meaner &amp; baser sot.</p>
      <p>The Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> on a time demaunded of the Poet <hi>Virgill,</hi> that hee would teach him how hee might conserue himselfe in the Empire, and alwayes bee acceptable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">A question demaunded by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus of Virgil, and his answere.</note> weale.</p>
      <p>To whom <hi>Virgil</hi> aunswered. I I thinke, O mighty <hi>Caesar,</hi> that to raigne long in the Empire, thou must considerately looke into thy seife, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining thy life and doings: and how much thou shalt see thy selfe excell, and exceede all those (of thy Empire) in dignity: So much more must thou endeauour thy selfe to surmount all others in vertue and worthinesse: for hee is vnworthy to rule a multitude, that is not chiefe himselfe in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
      <p>Those therefore that in Court of Princes beare office and authoritie, ought earnestly to desire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour themselues to auoyde the filthy sinke of vice, and to seeke the cleare Spring of vertue: For otherwise, they shall bee more defamed for one vice or defect found in them, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for their office and authority they haue.</p>

   <div type="part">
      <head>The Author concludeth.</head>
      <p>According to the saying of the Poet <hi>Virgill</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> I am also of opinion (my Lord) that you ought to bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and well aduised, in looking into your selfe who you are, what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer you are of, what you are worth, and what you possesse: and doing thus, you shall find that among your wise Counsellours you are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, among the rich, among the best esteemed, among the most fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, among your Secretaries, among the Rulers, amongst all those of your Realme and Subiects, you are euer
<pb n="571" facs="305"/>
the greatest. And therefore as you are greatest, and supreme aboue them all: so you ought the more to force to bee the most vertuous of them all: For els it were against al reason, being the greatest, to be the least, and most inferior of all: For truly none ought to be praysed for good, for that he is of power, force, possessions, wealth, much worth, in fauour of dignitie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any nobilitie that is in him, if these naturall gifts bee not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with vertue and good works.</p>
      <p>The ancient Historiographers do highly commend the greatnesse of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Ptholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> the iustice of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the clemency of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> the patience of <hi>Augustus,</hi> the truth of <hi>Traian,</hi> the pitty of <hi>Anteninus,</hi> the temperancie of <hi>Constantius,</hi> the continency of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> and the humanity of <hi>Theodosius:</hi> so that we may say these so great and noble Princes haue wonne more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by their vertues, then they haue atchieued by triumphant victories: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a man bee neuer so dishonest, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">Sinne is not so pleasaot in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the remembrāce</note> and lasciuious, and that he bee rooted in all idlenes; let vs say and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch it for a truth, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (if he may returne to looke backe on himselfe, and that hee may call to mind what manner of man hee hath beene, what he is at this present, and to what end he may com) but that the remembrance of his forepassed faults and deedes should be more grieuous and irkesome to him, then the greate delight his body should take of the present pleasures: for neyther the wormes in the vines, nor the Locusts in the corne, nor the moths in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the little wormes in the wood are so hurtfull and dammagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as sinnes are of power to make a man sorrowfull. For to say truly, the pleasure wee receiue when we commit them is not so great, as is the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure wee feee after wee remember them. The which I considering my Lord, it causeth me to looke ouer my olde memorials, to examine my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, to strengthen my iudgement, and to seeke a new kinde of study, to no other end, but to finde out sweete words, diuers doctrines, and strange histories, by meanes whereof I might withdraw you from vaine and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, to cause you to walke in the right path, and to affect thinges vertuous and honest, though I haue alwayes knowne them as acceptable to you, as they haue beene familiar: for Princes seruants, the more they are busied with affayres, the lesse they know themselues.</p>
      <p>And therefore great paine suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hee, and with ouer venemous poison is he infected, that with others and for other occupieth all his time, &amp; for his own soules health cannot spare a moment of time. O what comforte and quiet were it vnto my heart, if it were assured it had taken the right way in the doctrine which I write to you, and that I had not erred in the counsels I giue you: so that in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my booke you might acquire profite thereby, and I of my trauell therein reape my full contentation. And to the end, my Lord, wee may better expresse the matter, search the wound, and stop the veines, that wee may leaue no part vncured, or dregges of infection.</p>
      <p>If hitherto I haue vsed plainnesse, I will now speake more plainely vnto you, and yet as one friend vseth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And therefore may it please you to accept these small written pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses in this booke, among all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue, proceeding from the handes of one that rather desireth the health of your soule, then the gaine and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of your affects and desires.</p>

      <head>All you that bee Princes familiars, and beloued Courtiers, obserue and retain with you these few precepts and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, neuer tell to any, al that you thinke. Shew not all that you haue, neyther take all that you desire: Tell not al that you know <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell for all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Courtiets.</note> Much lesse neuer doe all that you may: For the right path way to bring the fauoured Courtier into his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces disgrace, is to be addicted to his sensuall appetites, and vaine humors and not to bee guided with reason &amp; discretion.</p>
      <p n="2">2 Beware also you trust not, nor commit to the hazard of fortunes ticklenes, such things, as touch and concerne your person, honour, goods and consciences: For the wise Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that liueth in his Princes grace, will not rashly put himselfe in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in hope to saue himselfe harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, at all times when he listeth.</p>
      <p n="3">3 Although euery man offer his seruice to you, and seeme to bee at your commaundement when you shall neede him: yet I tell you (sir) I would not wish you had eyther neede of them, or of me: For many of those fine and curious Courtiers, which are the first that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to draw on your side, and to stand by, if neede bee, are commonly at the very pinch, the first and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to throw stones at our faces.</p>
      <p n="4">4 In other mens matters busie not your selfe too much: and in your owne, striue not with time, but take leysure: For liuing after this rule, you shall long keepe your selfe in the good and quiet estate you are in, and otherwise some inconuenience might lightly fall vpon you, that should make you remember what you were wont to be.</p>
      <p n="5">5 The imminent perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger those are in, which are mounted to the toppe of some high thing, or to the cliffe of some high and rockie mountaine, where they haue no other way to descend, but to fall, is much like to that of the familiars of Princes. And therefore, my Lord, I woulde wish you would procure you, such faithfull friends about you, that they hauing regard and care of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, should alwayes holde you by the gowne for falling. And not such as after they had let you fall, would then lend you their hands to helpe you vp againe.</p>
      <p n="6">6 Albeit the things of the soule should bee preferted before all others of this worldly life, yet neuerthelesse I will bee content, so that you haue as great care &amp; consideration of your conscience, as you haue of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</p>
      <p>All which I was willing to tell you sir, to the end you may better vnderstand, that those that are in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation with the Prince, though they may benefite by time, in taking their time, yet time doth neuer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by them at all.</p>
      <p>You must euer doe good to your vttermost power, and neuer doe displeasure to any, though it lye in your power, and that you haue iust cause.</p>
      <p>For the teares of the poore that are iniuried, and the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cries and plaintes of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, may possibly one daye ascend to the presence of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall Seate, where God shall sit in his Maiesty, demaunding iustice and vengeance against you: and
<pb n="577" facs="306"/>
also come to the cares of the Noble Prince, to cause you to bee hated of him for euer.</p>
      <p n="8">8 Touching the fauor you will shew to anie, eyther in Offices, or other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites <note place="margin">Christians are in all things to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before all others.</note> you will bestowe on any man, take heed you alwayes rather preferre honest and true Christians, then your owne neere Kins-men or friendes. For a man may lawfully make his Friende partaker of his goods, but not of his Conscience.</p>
      <p n="9">9 In your counsells you geue, in any wise bee not too much affectioned in them, neyther scorne with those that contrary your opinion. Be not proud and seuere vnto those you doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, neyther doe any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good aduisement and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, albeit in Princes Courts euery man doth admire and beholde the excellencie and worthines of the person, yet are those alwayes that are most in fauour of the Prince, more noted, regarded, and sooner accused then others.</p>
      <p n="10">10 If you will not erre in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles you shall giue, nor fayle in those things you shall enterprise: Embrace those that tell you the truth, and reiect and hate those, whom you know to be Flatterers and dissemblers. For you should rather desire to bee admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of the thing present, then to be counselled after the dammage recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
      <p>Although wee suppose assuredly, that all these things aboue-written, are not likely to happen, nor yet come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so to passe, as I haue spoken: yet if it may please you (Syr) to remember, they are not therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
      <p>For spitefull <hi>Fortune</hi> permitteth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that the Sayles, which in stormie weather the Lightnings and boystrous Tempests could not breake and teare in piec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>, are afterwardes vpon a sudden (euen in the sweete of the mornings sleepe, each man taking his rest, leauing the Seas before in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et calme) all to shiuered, and torne a sunder. He that meaneth to giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a blowe also, the more he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backe his arme, with greater force hee striketh. And euen so (neyther more nor lesse) sayeth <hi>Fortune</hi> with those on whom for a time shee smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. For, the longer a man remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in her loue and fauor, the more cruell and bitter she sheweth herselfe to him in the ende.</p>
      <p>And therefore I would aduise eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise and Sage person, that when <hi>Fortune</hi> seemeth best of all to fauour him, and to doe most for him, that then hee should stand most in feare of her, and least of all to trust her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
      <p>Therefore (Syr) nake no small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this my Booke, little though it bee. For you know, that doubtlesse (as experience teacheth vs) of greater price and value is a little sparke of a Dyamond, then a greater ballast.</p>
      <p>It forceth little that the Booke bee of small or great volume, sith the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie thereof consisteth not in the number of leaues more or lesse, but only in the good and graue sentences that are amply written therein.</p>
      <p>For, euery Authour that writeth, <note place="margin">What the Author or wryter of books should ayme at.</note> to make his booke of great price and shew, ought to be briefe in his words, and sweete and pleasaunt in his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee treateth of, the better to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the minde of the Reader, and also not to growe tedious to the hearer.</p>
      <p>And (Syr) I speake not without cause, that you should not a little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme this smal treatise of mine, since you are most assured, that with time all your things shall haue ende, your Friendes shall leaue you, your goods shall bee diuided, your selfe shall dye, your fauour and credit shall diminish. and those that succeede you, shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you, you not knowing to whome
<pb n="574" facs="307"/>
your Goods and Patrimonie shall come: and aboue all, you shall not knowe what conditions your heyres and children shall be of. But for this I wryte in your royall Historic and Chronicle of your laudable vertues and perfections, and for that also I serue you as I doe, with this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worke, the memorie of you shall remaine eternized to your Successors for euer.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Chilo</hi> the Phylosopher beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether there were anything in the world that <hi>Fortune</hi> had not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to bring to nought, aunswered in this sort. Two things only there are, which neither <hi>Time</hi> can consume, nor <hi>Fortune</hi> destroy: And that is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of man written in bookes, and the <hi>veritie</hi> that is hidden.</p>
      <p>For though truth for a time lye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, yet it <hi>resurgeth againe, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life, appearing manifestly to all.</hi> And euen so in like case the vertues we find written of a man, doe cause vs at this present to haue him in as great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as those had in his time, that best knewe him.</p>
      <p>Reade therefore (Syr) at times I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, these writings of mine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I feare me you can scant borrow a moment of Time with leysure once to looke vpon it, beeing (as I knowe you are) alwayes occupyed in affayres of great importance, wherin me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you should not so surcharge your selfe, but that you might for your com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modity and recreation of your spirits, reserue some priuate houres to your selfe. For sage and wise men should so burden themselues with care of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers toyle, that they shold not spend one houre of the day at the least (at their pleasure) to looke on their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and condition.</p>
      <p>As recounteth <hi>Suetonius Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his quotidian warres he had; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer let slip one day, but that he reade or wrote some thing.</p>
      <p>So that being in his Pauillion in the Campe, in the one hand hee held his lance to assault his enemie; and in the other the penne he wrote withall, with which he wrote his worthy Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. The resonable man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling to mind the straight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note place="margin">A wise man reserueth some time for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</note> that he must render of himselfe, and of the time he hath lost, shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be more carefull that hee lose not his time, then he shall be to keepe his treasure: For the well imployed time is a meane and helpe to his sal saluation: and the euill gotten good a cause of his eternall damnation.</p>
      <p>Moreouer yet, what toyle and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is it to the body of the man, and how much more perill to the liuing soule, when hee consumeth his whole dayes and life in worldly broyles, and yet seely man hee cannot absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from that vile drudgery, til death doth summon him to yeelde vp his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his life and doings.</p>
      <p>And now to conclude my Prologue I say this booke is diuided into two parts, that is to say, in the first tenne Chapters is declared how the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Courtier shall behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the Princes Court, to winne fauour and credit with the Prince, and the surplus of the work treateth, when hee hath atchieued to his Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and acquired the credite of a worthy Courtier: how he shall then continue the same to his further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement.</p>
      <p>And I doubt not, but that the Lords and Gentlemen of Court, will take pleasure to reade it, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such as are Princes familiars, and beloued of Court, shall most of all reape profite thereby, putting the good lessons and aduertisements they finde heretofore written in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For to the young Courtiers it sheweth them what they haue to do: and putteth in remembrance also the
<pb n="575" facs="307"/>
olde fauoured Courtyer, (liuing in his princes grace) of that he hath to be cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumspect of. And finally, I conclude (Syr) that of all the Treasures, riches, gifts, fauours, prosperities, pleasures, seruices, greatnesse, and power, that you haue and possesse in this mortall and transitorie life: and by the Faith of a true Christian I sweare vnto you also, that you shal carrie no more with you, then that onely <hi>Time,</hi> which you haue well and vertuously employed, during this your Pilgrimage.</p>
