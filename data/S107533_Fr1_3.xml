   <head>TO HENRY MY DEAREST SONNE, AND NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRALL SYC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSOVR.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to can so rightlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain this booke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiones to a Prince in all the points of his calling, aswell generall, as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an towards God; as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb facs="4"/>as a King towardes his people? Whome-to, I say, can it so justly appertaine, as vnto you my dearest Sonne? Since J the authour thereof as your naturall Father, must be careful for your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vertuous education, as my eldest Sonne, and the first fruits of Gods blessing towards me in my posterity: and as a King must timous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prouide for your training vp in all the pointes of a Kings office; since ye are my naturall and lawfull succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor therin: that being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="4"/>informed heer-by, of the waight of your burthen, ye may in time begin to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that being borne to be a king, ye are rather borne to <hi>onus,</hi> then <hi>honos:</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all your people so far in ranke and honour, as in daylie care and hazardous paines-taking, for the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full administration of that great office, that God hath laide vpon your shoulders. Laying so a juste symmetrie and proportion, betuixt the height of your honourable place, and the heauie waight
<pb facs="5"/>of your great charge: and consequētlie, in-ease of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whiche God forbid, of the sadnesse of your fall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of that height. J haue therfore for the greater ease to your memory, and that ye may at the firste, cast vp any parte that ye haue to doe with, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided this treatise in three partes. The first teacheth you your duty towards God as a Christian: the next, your duty in your office as a king: and the third informeth you howe to behaue your selfe
<pb facs="5"/>in indifferent things, whiche of them-selues are neither right nor wrong, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are rightlie or wrong vsed; &amp; yet will serue according to your behauiour therein, to augment or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire your fame and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at the handes of your people Receaue and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this booke then, as a faithfull Praeceptour and counsellor vnto you: whiche, because my affaires will not permit me euer to be present with you, I ordaine to be a residēt faithfull admonisher
<pb facs="6"/>of you. And becaus the houre of death is vncertaine to me, as vnto all fleshe, I leaue it as my Testament &amp; latter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will vnto you. Charging you in the presence of God, and by the fatherlie authority J haue ouer you, that ye keepe it euer with you, as carefully, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi> Ye will find it a just &amp; impartial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour; neither flattering you in any vice, nor impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning you at vn-meete times. It will not come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, neither speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speered
<pb facs="6"/>at: and yet confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with it when ye are at quiet, ye shall say with <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> that ye are <hi>nunquam minùs folus, quàm cum solus.</hi> To conclude then, I charge you, as euer ye thinke to deserue my fatherly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to followe and put in practise, as farre as lyeth in you, the praecepts heer-after following. And if ye followe the contrare course, J take the great GOD to recorde, that this booke shall one day be a witnesse betuixt me and
<pb facs="7"/>you; and shall procure to be ratified in heauen, the cursse that in that case heere I giue vnto you. For I protest before that great God, I had rather not be a Father, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, then be a Father of wicked children. But ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yea euen promising vnto my self, that God, who in his great blessing sent you vnto me; shall in the same blessing, as he hath giuen me a Sonne; so make him a good and a godlie Sonne; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting him of his mercie
<pb facs="7"/>shewed vnto me: I end, with my earnest praier to GOD, to worke effectuallie into you, the fruites of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, whiche heere from my hart J bestowe vpon you.</p>
