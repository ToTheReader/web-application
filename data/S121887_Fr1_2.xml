Now for that this businesse is common to the world, this booke may best satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the world, because it was penned in the Land it treateth of. If it bee disliked of men, then I would recommend it to women, for being dearely bought, and farre sought, it should be good for Ladies. When all men reiected <hi>Christopher Collumbus:</hi> that ever renowned Queene Izabell of Spaine, could pawne her Iewels to supply his wants; whom all the wise men (as they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) of that age contemned. I need not say what was his worthinesse, her noblenesse, and their ignorance, that so scornefully did spit at his wants, seeing the whole world is enriched with his golden fortunes. Cannot this successfull example moue the incredulous of this time, to consider, to conceaue, &amp; apprehend <hi>Virginia,</hi> which might be, or breed vs a second India? hath not England an Izabell, as well as Spaine, nor yet a <hi>Collumbus</hi> as well as <hi>Genua?</hi> yes surely it hath, whose desires are no lesse then was worthy <hi>Collum bus,</hi> their certainties more, their experiences no way wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, only there wants but an Izabell, so it were not from Spaine.</p>
