   <head>THE AVTHORS EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>CHRISTIAN READER,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Wise man saith, that <hi>of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many Bookes, there is no end, and much study is a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the flesh:</hi> (Eccl. 12.12.) And therefore in so great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Bookes now extant, it will bee thy wisedome for thy exercise to make choyse of some few of the best. By which meanes, thy toile in reading will be the lesse, and thy gaine the more.</p>
   <p>The Booke of all Bookes is the Bible; which by way of Excellency is called the Scripture. Of which I may say, as DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID <hi>of the Sword of</hi> GOLIATH, <hi>there is none like that:</hi> (1, Sam, 21.9.) <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding</hi> the Word of the <hi>LORD
<pb facs="12"/> is to many a reproch, and they haue no delight in it:</hi> (Ier. 6, 10.) <hi>And beeing full, doe despise the Hony combe:</hi> (Prou. 27.7.) Such <hi>are but naturall, not having the Spirit:</hi> (Iud. 19.) And therefore vnable to discerne their owne need, or where to bee supplyed: (<hi>Reu.</hi> 3.17.) Others there are, <hi>of whom I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded better things: who having tasted of the good Word of God:</hi> (Heb. 6, 9.) <hi>And by it also how gracious the Lord is, doe as new borne Babes, desire the sincere milke of the word, that they may grow thereby:</hi> (1. Pet 2.3.) But yet they finding <hi>many things hard to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:</hi> (2. Pet. 3.16.) And themselues to bee but <hi>as a Child weaned from the milke, and drawne from the Breasts:</hi> (Isa. 28 9.) <hi>Not having the vnderstanding of a man in</hi> them: (<hi>Prou.</hi> 30.2) Are by this meanes much discouraged from the reading of it; which yet in the very <hi>entrance thereinto, doth giue light, and vnderstanding to the simple:</hi> (Psal. 119.130.) Such must know, that as when the Iron is blunt, and the Wood knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, men put to the greater strength; so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall defects, in the effecting of difficult things, and of such consequence, as is the reading of the Scripture, must not make them to desist; but rather set them on, to be more serious, humble, orderly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb facs="12"/> in the reading of the same. And for their further direction therein, this must be remembred, that the Booke of Scripture, is as the Waters of the Sanctuary, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.) In which a Lambe might wade, and an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Swim. Therein is contained <hi>strong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>staete,</hi> as well as <hi>Milke: (Heb.</hi> 5.12) Such as doe discerne themselues to bee but <hi>Babes,</hi> there is <hi>Milke</hi> provided for them: And <hi>let</hi> them <hi>leaue the strong meat vnto such, who by reason of vse, haue their sences exercised in discerning good &amp; evill, vntill themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so come to a more full age in</hi> Christ: Heb. 5.14,</p>
   <p>Now if uch also, shall complaine, of the shortnesse of memory; by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with the prolixity of the Booke of GOD, and the various matter promiscuously couched therein; so as what they haue read, is <hi>as water spilt on the ground:</hi> (2, Sam. 14.14.) Such with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scripture, in the manner aforesaid, must ioyne after meditation: as DAVID, who <hi>hid the word in</hi> his <hi>heart:</hi> (Psal. 119.11.) And MARY who <hi>pondered,</hi> and thereby kept <hi>those things,</hi> which <hi>were told her by the Shepheards:</hi> (Luk. 2.19.) Moreouer, if they will <hi>not bee forgetfull hearers of the Word,</hi> they must <hi>bee doers of the same:</hi> (Isa. 1.25.) And withall, let
<pb facs="13"/> them <hi>pray the Comforter, which</hi> is the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST, who <hi>shall then both teach; and bring all things to theyr remembrance, whatsoever hee hath said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Notwithstanding all which labour, because many things, as eares of Corne out of the Sheafe may sl p weake memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; I haue therefore gleaned after; and from the whole B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oke of GOD, as out of a large and fertile Feild, gathered vp such Simples, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> are most Cordiall to the weakest Christian, and of sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ciall vse vnto all. Among which, because the Promises, are both the breeders, and nourishers of Sauing-Faith, the Fountaine of Spirituall Life; and therefore of price vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to drooping Spirits, who <hi>are weary, and heavy laeden:</hi> (Math. 11.28.) I haue for their sakes more principally layd hold vpon them; that with <hi>ioy they might draw Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>t of the Wells of Salvation:</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sa. 12.3.) And because there are others also, with whom <hi>the Consolations of GOD, are small,</hi> or of none effect; (Iob. 15.11.) I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> vnto each promise, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed its conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> Iudgement. And in fine, haue summed vp all the particular Iudgements vnder the Generall, and
<pb facs="13"/> therewith also, answered such Obiections, as are by Carnall Men vsually made.</p>
   <p>And out of all, I haue also inferred such vses of Reproofe, Instruction, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as the said Scripture hath brought to my hand, meetly to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. That if such will but reade what is written, and lay hold on Instruction, they may no longer forsake their owne Mercies, but be moued to come vnto CHRIST and liue.</p>
   <p>All which I haue as well as I could, reduced to such Heads, and in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Composed them; as by the helpe of my Table, and Catalogue of Chapters, immediatly ensuing; euery Reader may readily find out such places, as hee stands in need of, and shall desire to bee furnished with. But with this Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the intelligent Reader; that for such Scriptures, as may diuersly bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; if in searching hee doe misse of them in one place, hee may find them in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And for the better preventing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of Scruples from the ignorant, or tender Conscience; and of Cauils from the wilfully obstinate; I haue Dialogue-wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued the same into Question and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
   <pb facs="14"/>
   <p>And such things, as in which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more plenteous, I haue answere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> one Question, with many Scriptures Which the ignorant Reader aduisedly com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paring together: that is to say, the darke and obscure places, with those which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> more plaine, and easie, and the Questio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> with the answer, he shall find his Iudgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> also, in the vnderstanding of such places something bettered thereby. And if in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

      </gap> doing, hee shall find himselfe yet to seek, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> therfore do say as the Eunuch vnto PHILIP How shall I vnderstand these things withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> Kernell, which is the true sence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</p>
   <p>Which worke, now some yeeres past I hauing finished; and at the first onset, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for my owne priuate: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing by the incouragement of som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> learned, and instigation of other Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <pb facs="14"/> seest, to the Presse, for the vse of many.</p>
   <p>By which my labour, if thou findest thy selfe any thing helped in thy ioy, or some other way Christianly edyfied (leauing the Instrument to vanish in his owne obscurity) let thine eyes bee fixed on him, who by the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings, is able to make perfect his owne praise. Vnto whose Grace I commend thee.</p>
