      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Desire thee (Christian Reader) vvhosoeuer thou art that delightest in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> glory of Christ against the malyce of Antichriste, and I beseech thee in the Lord to conster all thinges to the beste, euen those matters vvhich seeme to be spoken more bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that mōstrous beast and not to depraue them vvith slaūderings, as I vnderstand some of late haue taken occasion to do by my late booke published of the vvriters of Englande. Among vvhom some are not ashamed vntrulye to saye that I deale vniustlye vvith some Princes that gouerne the estates of Christēdome. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some saye that I speake malepertlye and that against all Christiā mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destye, that I speake vnreuerentlye of Queene Mary of England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in one place I haue vvritten that Iesabell raigneth in Englāde, and glutteth her selfe vvith the bloude of Martyrs: vvhere as by that name I did not meane Queene Mary, but the tyrannie of Rome that miserablye ouerrunneth all Englande. For the places in Nicolas Grimoald, Traherne, Turner the Phisition, Hooper▪ Ridley, Rogers, Bradford, Filpot, and other, do sufficientlye interprete themselues to be spoken of the greate Antichriste and his mitred and scraped tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentours. For as the holye ghoste hath taughte mee I haue called that Romaine Sinagogge the murtherer of Godlye men, vvicked Iesabell, the horned beast, the impe of the Dragō, the doughter of the deuill, the spouse of Sathan, speaking blasphemies, the purple beast, the misticall Babilon, the great strumpet vvith vvhom the kinges of the earth haue cōmitted fornication, vvhich haue dronke of the vvyne of her fornication, the vvomā cloathed in purple, scarlet, gould, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and precious stones, hauing a goulden cuppe full of all filthines &amp; lustes of the vvorld, the mother of fornication, and droncke vvith the bloud of the saintes of IESVS CHRIST, the habitatiō of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and the cage of all euill spirites and hatefull birdes.</p>
   <p>The occasiō vvhich first moued mee herevnto vvas this, Anno do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 1554. our Realme of Englande after the xx. yeare of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce throughe the mercye of God, most shamefullye forsooke the holye Gospel of Christe, vvhich is the povver and vertue of God to the health of all beleuers, &amp; made a nevve professiō vnto the great ennemye of God the Romaine deuil and vvicked Antichrist. Of the vvhich execrable deede thou shalt read more in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> end of this booke. Partlye also the horrible vices vvhich follovv this monster, vvhereof
<pb facs="19"/>
the most prudent K. Henry the eight had good proofe, vvhen he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the houses of the hooded hypocrites, &amp; the colleges of the masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers in his kingdome, before their vtter destruction vvhich vvas in the yeare of our Lord God 1538. to be visited, by the vvorshipfull doctours of the lavve, Thomas Lee, Richard Laiton, Thomas Bedill, Thomas Barthlet the publicke notarie, &amp; such others. In the vvhich there vvere such svvarmes of vvhoremōgers, ruffians, filthie parsons, giltye of sinne against nature, Ganimedes, and yet votaries and vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed all, so that thou vvouldest thincke that there vvere a nevve Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha amonge them. The booke of them is called the breuiary of thinges founde out in abbeyes, assemblies, colleges, &amp;c. Out of the vvhich booke I vvill shevv but one or other example, to an vnsaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tast thereof. In the monasterye called Battel abbey in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Chichester, these many gilty of sinne agaīst nature vvere foūd in the visitation, Iohn the Abbot, Richard Salchurst, Thomas Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berth, VVilliam March, Iohn Hasting, Gregorie Champiō, Clemēt VVestfild, Iohn Crosse, Thomas Crambroke, Thomas Basill, Iohn Hamfild, Iohn Hierome, Clemens Grigge, Richard Touye, and Iohn Austine. These vvere incontinente liuers, Thomas Lyuet vvyth one maryed vvife &amp; one harlot, Thomas Cranbroke vvith the same, and other beside. Lo this is the chast Religion of the Pope.</p>
   <p>At Canterbury amonge the Benedictine monkes these vvere gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sinne against nature, Richard Godmersham, VVilliam Lichfild, Christopher Iames, Iohn Goldmistone, Nicolas Clement, VVilliam Causton, Iohn Ambrose, Thomas Farlegh, and Thomas Morton. VVhoremongers, Christopher Iames aforesaide vvith three maried vvomen, and Nicolas Clement vvith one harlot. In the Abbey of S. Augustine these vvere found vnchast, Iohn the Abbot vvith one vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Iohn Langdan vvith tvvo, Iohn Langport vvith one, Richarde Compton vvith one, VVilliam Reynsforth vvith one, VVilliā God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merstone vvith tvvo, Dauid Franckes vvith tvvo, Robart saltvvood one, Laurence Goldstone one, VVilliam Holingborne one, VVilliā Milton one, Iohn Shrevvsbery one, and Thomas Barhā gilty of sinne against nature. In the abbey of Bath amonge many other Richard Lincombe had vii. harlots, iij. maryed vvomen, and iiii. singlevvomen and he vvas giltye of sinne against nature also, VVilliam Benushon had xi. harlots, beside diuers gilty of sinne against nature. In the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of Monkenferlege in Salisbury diocesse, Levvis the Prior had 9. harlots, Richard the Prior of Mayden Bradley had v. harlots and sixe bastardes, VVilliam the Abbot of Bristovve had iiij. harlots, iij. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried
<pb facs="19"/>
&amp; one maryed. Thomas Abbot of Abingtō beside his ovvne naturall sister of vvhom he begat tvvo children, had three other har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and this mā vvas the father of many that vvas gilty of sin against nature. In the abbey of Sulbred in the diocesse of Cicester George VValden Prior had vij. harlots, Iohn Standney vij. Nicolas duke v. Henry Selvvood tvvo, vvith many others. Iohn Blanke Prior of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondsey had xi. harlots.</p>
   <p>At the castel of VVyndsor Henry VVoodvvard had very many har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, Nicolas VVhyden had iiij. George VVhitthorne v. Nicolas Spoke v. Simon Tod one, Nicolas VValker ij. VVilliam Vause one, Robart Dauison vj. Peter Boughe had many, and so other had others.</p>
   <p>In the Cathedrall Church at Chichester, Iohn Champion Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of VValtam had ij. harlots, VVilliā Crosse had one vvyfe, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Parker ij. harlots, Richard Busteld one of vvhō he begat a child, Barthelmevv Cokisley i. Robart hunt had diuers, Tho. Goffe had ij. being other mens vvyues, Iohn Hill xiij. harlots, Robart Moore had many, Roger Barham many, Iohn Bedfild many, vvith others, amōg y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> vvhich the forsaid Roger Barham and Iohn Champion vvere gilty of sinne against nature. These vvere taken out of the foresaid booke. Behold vvhat monsters Popery hath nourished throughout England in abbeyes and colleges. Are not these foule birdes most iustlye ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished vvith their most filthye Pope, the Romishe Idoll? In all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places as vvell in congregations as colleges the like thinges are committed and done, the vvhich vvere to longe or rather to shameful throughly to declare, for they gate vnto them in most places through this Popishe Religion, either the French pockes or the Spanishe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. And there vvere in Englande more then xl. Abbeyes of diuers kindes of mōkes, beside the most vvicked nests of the begging fryers, of the vvhich there vvere almost tvvo hundreth. Vnto vvhom these verses do aptlye agree.
<q>
         <l>It is not sure a misse that monkes should fathers termed bee,</l>
         <l>Sith such swarmes of their bastard brats in euery place they see.</l>
      </q>
There is yet a thirde matter vvhich forced mee herevnto, and hauing seene and heard these thinges vehemently moued me to vvrite. This is the precepte of Christe in the xviij. Chapter of the Reuelation of S. Iohn: For a voyce came from heauen from the right hand of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the euerlasting throne of Christe, vvith a great voyce soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our eares saying. Go from her my people lest ye be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of her vvickednes, and ye receiue part of her punishment. For her sinnes are gone vp to heauen, and God hath remembred her vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes.
<pb facs="20"/>
And then commaundemēt follovveth vvhich vvas giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the beast vvith seuen heades. Revvard her euen as she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarded you, and giue her double according to her vvorks, and poure in double to her in the same cup vvhich she filled vnto you. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as she glorified her selfe and liued vvantonly, so much poure you into her of punishment and sorrovve. This is the vvorde of the Lorde declared vnto vs as vvell here as in the fiftye Chap. of Ieremy. That this serpent might perish &amp; all his doinges brought to nought. Yet for al this I do vvel remēber the sayings of S. Paule, that al Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be honoured although they be vvicked and vnprofitable for a common vvealth, because they be placed there of God, neither to speake euill of them beinge but vvotmes, dust and ashes, Neither dare I murmur against the prouidence of God, vvhich is contrary to his holy vvorde. Therefore from the bottome of my hart I beseech our Lorde and Redeemer Iesus Christe, that he vvould haue mercye vppon all Kinges, Princes and Nations, and so prouide that all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons maye be so gouerned as is most tending to his glory: For vvhose reueng he hath most stoutly fortifyed mee vp in this my old age. Not studying to derogate or take avvaye the honour from anye Christian Kinge, but onely to inuey against the Romishe beast, the Synagog of Sathan, and most vvicked Antichrist, vvith the vvritings and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye of most learned men.</p>
   <p>If I shal haue said any thing sharper then thou didst loke for (most gentle Reader) cōsider I pray you the hudge tirāny of this most vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Viper of the vvorld, vvhose destruction accordinge to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises is at hande. Great Babilon shall fall vvhich hath seduced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, and shall be destroyed the vvhole vvorlde marueylinge thereat. If the vehemencye of my stile shall offende thee, beholde the maruelous force of the holye ghoste in the Prophete Dauid and most holy king, vvho in the Lordes cause most stoutlye saide: I haue hated the congregation of the vvicked, Psal. 25. He promiseth also aftervvarde by his Prophetes, that he vvoulde destroye the brothell houses and vvicked places. Ezechi. 16. I vvill shevve fayth the Lord vnto all Nations thy nakednes, and to al kingdomes thy shame Nahum. 3. Thy dishonour and filthines shall be opened, and thy reproche shall be seene, I vvill be reuenged, and none shall resiste mee, Esay▪ 47. VVoe be vnto those Kinges as manye as haue vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the beast or haue ayded her, or haue receiued helpe of her, or haue committed fornication vvith her, as many as haue serued her, and haue ioyned handes against the Lambe, and vvaged battell for
<pb facs="20"/>
her cause, because their names are not vvritten in the booke of lyfe from the beginninge of the vvorlde. And the Lambe shal ouercome them at the last like a Lorde of Lordes, and kinge of kinges, and they shall go together vvith the beast to destruction and vtter dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Apocalips 17. GOD therefore giue in the hartes of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vvhom the x. hornes do shadovve, that they maye faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this his vvill and iudgement, that they maye make her deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and leaue her naked, that they maye eate her fleshe and burne her in fire, that is, let her abide her last punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the sheding of the innocent bloud, of so manye faithfull Christians. Be it done, Be it done. Amen.</p>
