Luther. And the Catholike religion euidently deduced through all our kings and archbishopps of Canterburie from S. Austin to our time, and the valour and vertue of our kings, and the great learninge and sanctitie of our archbishopps, together with diuers saints and miracles which in their times proued the Catholike faith; so sett downe as it may seeme also an abridgment of our ecclesiasticall histories.

   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>TVVo onelie meanes (Gentle Reader) hath allmightie God giuen vs to be assured of truth.<note place="margin">Tvvo onely vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies to be certaine. Science. Beleef.</note> The one by <hi>Science</hi> of euident truth which we our selues do know. The other by <hi>Beleefe</hi> of euident authoritie of others, who in like manner do know, and whose testimonie we haue no iust cause to mistrust. And therfor as he who should reiect euident reason, should both be vnreasonable in fightinge against reason and iniurious both to God and himselfe by refusinge a meane which God hath giuen him to atttayne to truth.<note place="margin">VVhy good authoritye aught to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> So likewise he who should reiect euident Authoritie should both do against reason which biddeth him giue creditt to such authoritie, and be iniurious to God and him selfe by castinge away such a meane as God gaue him to assure him selfe of such truth as by himselfe he could not know, and finallie should be an enemie to humaine societie which cannot stand vnles men do creditt one an other in thinges wherin they haue no cause to distrust them for what should we know of things past before our time, or of thinges done out of our sight, if we would not beleeue such as were present and knew them, and ether by word or writing haue reported them to vs. How should we know such to be our parents but by beleefe? How should any matter be tryed in Law but by beleefe of mens wordes or writinges, what familiaritie, humayne societie or frendship could stand if we admitt not beleefe?
<pb facs="16"/> VVherfor abbeit it be a fault to beleeue vpon light or small testimonie (which kind of beleeuers the scripture tearmeth light of hart) as it is a fault to assent to any friuolous reason: yet contrariwise it is a greater fault not to giue credit to euident sufficient authoritie, as it is not to yeild to euident reason. For in beleuinge vpon weake authoritie we do but preiudice our selues, but in not beleeuinge sufficient authoritie we hinder our selues from knowledge of truth, discredit our owne reportes to others, do against reason which as well bindeth vs to yeild to euident authoritie, as to euident reason, discredit our neighbors and cut in sunder the very sinowes of humane frendship and societie.<note place="margin">lib. de vtil. Cred. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note>
   </p>
   <p>VVherfor wel said S. Austin that <hi>though it be miserable to be deceaued by authority, yet most miserable it is not to be moued with authoritie.</hi> And most vnreasonably do some Ministers,<note place="margin">Hovv manie things vvhich are not in scripture are yet to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> say that they are not bound to beleeue the great vertues or miracles of Saints in times past, though neuer so authentically recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because they be not in scripture. Indeed if we vrged them to beleue these thinges with diuine and christian faith they might haue some colourable excuse of such speech, because (as they say) all poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of christian faitb are in scripture. But sith we vrge them onelie to giue humane beleefe to such matters, either they must shew some cause why the authority of such writers is not sufficient to giue humane credite vnto the thinges by them recorded, or they must reiect all humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb facs="16"/> all mens wordes or writinges, and beleeue nothinge but what either God hath written, or them selues haue seene. for if Scripture must be the onelie square of all our beleife both humane and Dyuine, we must beleue nothing but what God haeh written, no not that such were our parentes, that ther are Turkes Moores ar any such thinge as the Scripture mentioneth not. Or if we admitt (as we must needes) that humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by either word or writinge may be sufficient for vs to beleue thinges with humayne faith, as vve beleue such to be our parentes, and the like, vve must not thinke it reason to reiect a thinge, because it is not in Scripture,<note place="margin">Inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of not bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mens authoritie</note> but vve must allso shevv some reason, vvhy such authoritie as testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth it, is not sufficient for a vvise man to giue credit vnto: or els we must confesse our selues to be vvilfull, to reiect sufficient authoritie vvithout, yea against reason; to be in iurious to God and our selues in reiecting a meane vvhich he hath bestovved vpon vs, for to knovv truth; Iniurious to our neighbours in discreditinge them vvithout cause; and finallie pernicious to all good frendshipp and societie vvhich vvithout beleefe of humane authoritie cannot stand. And to preuent Ministers that they shall not delude the Reader by sayinge that the authoritie vvhich I alleadge for vvhat I say of Saint Austin and Luther is not sufficient.<note place="margin">Onely Protestāts alledged for vvhat is said of Luther.</note> I beseech him to consider that the Authors vvhich I alleadge for vvhat I say of Luther are onelie Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testantes, uch as by other Protestantes are greatlie
<pb facs="17"/> commended. for albeit I might iustlie alleadge the testimonies of Catholiques against Luther as I shew heerafter <hi>lib. 2. cap. 1.</hi> yet partelie to avoyd all cauills, but principallie because Protestantes testifie ynough against him, I omitt this aduantage. And the vvitnesses vvhich I produce for vvhat I vvrite of S. Austin, are partelie the said Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, partely Catholikes, but such Catholiques as some of them are great Saintes, some great Clarkes, some lyued vvhen the thinges vvere done vvhich they vvritt, some vvere domesticall, some forrayne, and all vvere before this controuersie betvvene Protestants and Catholikes arose, and all are greatlie esteemed of Protestants as shall appeare in the Catalogue ensuinge, and finallie all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested and approued in their testimonies of diuers Protestants as shall appeare heerafter. VVhich kind of testimonie I hope no indifferent man guided vvith reason vvill account vnsufficient. And for other obstinat persons <hi>who</hi> (as S. Hierome saith) <hi>are wount shutting their eyes to denie what they will not beleue, I</hi> wrot not this vvorke for as S. Austin aduiseth vs vve should rather pray for these kind of men than reason vvhith them.<note place="margin">For vvhat Readers this boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke is vvritten.</note> But novv let vs come to the Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of the Catholike vvriters, and after of the Protestantes.</p>
