and a sister, deere kinsfolkes, and

I specially beene drawne to the penning of

these few Lectures, and to you do I commend

should returne the first fruits of my labours,

the same might be in some measure supplyed,
on my behalfe, &amp; I hope you will acknowlede
it, as a flower of your owne Garden, that with
greater delight, you may smell vnto it, and
the fruit of your owne field, and euen in that
respect more willingly eat of it, &amp; cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
digest it, to the increase of that stature,
and strength, whereunto you haue alreadie
attained in Christ; Oh what a ioy it was, the
last time that I was amongest you, to obserue
euen a generall, and most blessed change, that
whereas heretofore, nothing, but blind and
superstitious deuotion raigned, men, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

being like old vessels, which could not bee
seasoned, from retayning the sent of their

that so they might be fit to receiue the pure
<hi>liquor of the Gospell</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 9. 17.</note>. Nay alas, where
were they that should haue seasoned them?
the word of God, being much more precious,
<hi>than in the daies of Elie</hi>

Againe, in the people, what a loue
doth there beginne to spring towards the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
How cheerefully doe they by great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
flocke, to the hearing of the word?
with what earnestnesse doe they thereunto
attend? with what reuerence doe they by the
way, and at home talke and conferre thereof?
how beautifull are the feet of Gods Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that bring glad tidings of peace vnto
them, when they come into the Countrey?
how importunately doe they require to haue
the word of God preached? how diligently
doe they employ, and exercise their Children,
and seruants in the priuate reading of the
Scriptures? Bibles, being to be found in most
mens houses, whereas heretofore (for the most
<pb facs="12"/>
part) no other Bookes regarded, but such as
nusled them vp in superstition, or prohanesse,
(wherein I desire the Lord to forgiue the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of my youth) yea, in euerie companie;
some are found, that are readie in the

<hi>of the word of God</hi>

most places of the Land, with men
quallified with exellent gifts, for the worke of
the ministry. So it would please God, either to
raise vp amongst you, or (<hi>because a Prophet
is not esteemed in his countrey</hi>
      <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 23. 57.</note>) to send
some from elsewhere, that may be a light vnto
you, to direct your feet out of darkenesse,

      <hi>and shadow of death</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 4. 16</note>, into the way of
righteousnesse and life, by Iesus Christ,
and to this end that hee would mooue the
heart of our gratious King, and all godly
Rulers vnder him, with a tender commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration,
of the lamentable estate of so good
a people, who haue so many yeeres wandred
like sheep, for want of a Shepheard, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made the more subiect to be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
by the subtill and damnable flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
of roaging and vagabond Iesuites and
priests. And heerein I most instantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, in the bowels of Christ, that you
bee not wanting to your selues, but with
all care, and conscience; zeale, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
seeke the meanes whereby you may
be edified to eternall life, whilst this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
time of grace and mercie lasteth; that
so all of you may haue hope; sinne, may
bee abolished; idolatrie rooted out, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
ouerthrowne, Sathan trodden downe,
Hell confounded, the Gospell increase, and
righteousnesse flourish, to the glorie of God,
and ioy, of our godly King. Oh my deere
Countrey-men, kinsfolkes and friendes,
walke no longer in the ignorant, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and sinfull waies of our fore-fathers,
<pb facs="13"/>
but turne to the Lord, and declare repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
by the fruites thereof, come to the
Lord whilst his armes are stretched out to
embrace you, seeke him whilst he may be
found, call on him, whilst the time is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
and forsake all euill, both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and conuersation, so shall God bee
glorified, your soules saued, and all that
loue you in the Lord, exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.
For the stirring of you vp whereunto,
I am bold to commend this my first tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
vnto you: vouchsafe therefore, with
a louing mind, to accept my faithfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
towards you, open the Booke, and read
it with a desire to profite by it, it containeth
not any thing, to delight the vaine eare,
or content the curious mind, but that which
may instruct the ignorant, cōfort and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the weake and feeble conscience: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if I can promise nothing else, yet this one
thing may I assure thee, that thou hast this
whole Psalme, more amply, &amp; orderly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
than (to my knowledge) by any hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
I craue therefore, that if this Booke
shall fall into the hands of such, as (either
because they heard these Lectures, or are
otherwise so full of knowledge) can gather
<pb facs="14"/>
no sweete, from this withered flower, that
yet they would fauourably let it passe, to such
as it is sent, remembring S. <hi>Augustins</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
let those that know it alreadie, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, least I offend them, that know it
not; for it is better, to giue to him that
hath, than to turne away him that hath

such, who take a speciall felicitie, to carpe
at other mens doings, this is mine onely
comfort, that no man euer pleased all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and therefore, seeking the profit of
many, I contemne the carping reproofe of
some, and applying my selfe onely to please
God, and the godly, I waigh not at a
strawe, the censure of the wicked. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
courteous Reader, and if thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
any thing comfortable heerein, giue
God his due for it, and as I shall pray for
thee, that thy labours herein, and all other
thy godly exercises, may bee blessed with a
fruitfull increase, of all spirituall graces;
so I intreat thee, to beare with such es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes
and faultes, as shall happen in the
printing, (if there bee any) and especially
to helpe me with thy faithfull prayer vnto
God, for the increase of his graces in me,
<pb facs="14"/>
that the Church in Christ, may more, and
more bee profited by me.</p>
