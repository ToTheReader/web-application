   <head>The Preface of the Authour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehould now the fourth yeare is passed, when as preparing my selfe to my End, I retire to a place of quietnes and rest, exempt from negotiations, and throng of Busines; but not exempt from the meditation of the sacred Scriptures, and from the writing of such things, which to me in tyme of meditation do occur; That if I be not able to profit others either by my owne speaches, or by composing of any large and voluminous Booke; at least that I may be of power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance my Brethren in their spirituall Good, by some small deuout Treatise.</p>
   <p>Now calling to mind, of what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect I might chiefly make choyce, which might dispose me towards dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, &amp; might profit my Brethren towards liuing well; <hi>The death of our Lord</hi> presented it selfe to me, and that last <hi>Sermon</hi> of his, which consisting of <hi>seauen most short</hi> (but most graue) <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> the <hi>Redeemer of the World</hi> from
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> the Crosse, as from a high and eminent Chayre, deliuered to all Mākind: Since in that Sermon, or in those <hi>seauen Words,</hi> all those Points are contained, of which the said Lord thus speaketh, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. <hi>Behould, we go vp to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and all things shalbe consummate, which were written by the Prophets, of the sonne of Man.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Those things, which the Prophets did foretell of Christ, are reduced to foure Heads, or branches. To wit, to his <hi>Preaching</hi> and Sermons made to the People; To his <hi>Prayer</hi> directed to his Father; To the most <hi>grieuous Euills</hi> which he was to suffer; To su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime and <hi>admirable Works</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him. All which seuerall Points did admirably shine in the life of Christ. For first, our Lord did most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preach in the Temple, in the Synagogues, in the fields, in desert &amp; solitary places, in priuate Houses, and to conclude euen out of the ship, to the People standing vpon the shore.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, He spent for the most part, whole nights in Prayer to God; for thus the Euangelist speaketh: <hi>Luc.</hi> 6. <hi>He passed the whole night in Prayer to God,</hi> Now his admirable and
<pb n="7" facs="4"/> astonishing working of <hi>Wonders,</hi> of which the holy Gospells are very full, doth concerne the expelling of the Deuils, curing the sicke, multiplying of bread, and in appeasing or allaying tempests or stormes all sea. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the <hi>Euills</hi> that, in recompence of the Good which he had done, were perpetrated against him, were many, not only in contumely of Words, but also in stoning of him, and in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoring to cast him headlong dovvne from a fearefull Precipice.</p>
   <p>But all these seuerall Points were consummated and perfected most tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Crosse. For first, He so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly &amp; persuadingly preached from the Crosse, as that many returned from thence, <hi>knocking their Breasts.</hi> And further, not only the harts of men (but euen the stones, as it were, through a secret compassion) were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and torne a sunder. He in like manner so prayed vpon the Crosse, as that the Apostle sayth thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>Cum clamore valido, &amp; lachrimis, exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus est pro sua reuerentia,</hi> With a strong Crye, and teares, he was heard for his reuerence. Now what he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the Crosse, was of so high a
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> nature, in reference to those things which he had suffered through the rest of the life; as that they alone may be thought peculiarly to belong to the <hi>Passion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To conclude, He neuer wrought greater Prodigies and signes, then when lying vpon the Crosse, he was brought to extreme imbecillity and weaknes. For at that time, he did not only exhibite Miracles from Heauen, (the which the Iewes had before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely demaunded of him) but also a litle after, he wrought the greatest Miracle of all; When being dead and buried, by his owne proper force and Vertue, he returned from Hell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming his Body, restored it againe to life; yea to an immortall life. Therfore we may conclude, that vpō the Crosse all things were truly performed and accomplished, which were written by the Prophets of the Sonne of Man.</p>
   <p>But before we descend to write of the particular <hi>Words</hi> of our Lord, I hold it conducing to our purpose, to speake some thing of the <hi>Crosse</hi> it self, which was the Chayre or Pulpit of the Preacher, the Altar of the Priest sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fizing; the race, or place of him that
<pb n="9" facs="5"/> did combat and feight, the shop (as it were) of working miraculous things. First then, touching the forme of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> the more common Opinion of the Ancients is, that it consisted of three seuerall parcels of Wood; One long, vpon the which the Body of our Lord crucified, was laid or extended; another ouerthwart, in which the hāds were fastened; the third was affixed and ioined to the lower part, vpon the which the feet did rest, but so nailed thereto, that they could not be moued from thence. This is the Opinion of the two most ancient Fathers, <hi>S. Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Irenaeus:</hi> Who clearely shew, that both his feete did rest vpon the Wood, &amp; that the one foote was not lying vpon the other. From which posture of our Lords Body it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there were foure nayles of Christ, and not only three, as many do imagine, who out of that conceit do paint Christ our Lord, so vpon the Crosse, as if he had the one foot vpon the other. But <hi>Gregorius Turonensis (l. de glo. mart. c.</hi> 6.) most euidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth this, and fortifieth his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from ancient Pictures of Christ crucified. And I my selfe did see at
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
      <hi>Paris</hi> in the Kings Library, certaine most ancient <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, in diuers places wherof Christ was painted Crucified, but euer with foure Nayles.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the long <hi>Wood</hi> did somwhat appeare aboue that parcell of Wood, which was ouerthwart, as <hi>S. Austin,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory Nyssenus</hi> do write; And this seemeth also to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, who writing to the <hi>Ephesians, c.</hi> 3. thus sayth: <hi>That you may be able to comprehend with all the Saintes, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth,</hi> (to wit of the Crosse of Christ.) By which wordes he clearly describeth the figure of the Crosse, which hath foure extremities; to wit, <hi>Latitude</hi> in the ouerthwart or trāsuerse Wood; <hi>Longitude</hi> in the long Wood; <hi>Altitude,</hi> in that part of the lōg Wood which appeared aboue the ouerth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart; and <hi>Profundity</hi> in that part of the long Wood, which was stucke into the ground.</p>
   <p>Our Lord did not vndergoe this kind of Torment by chance, or vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; but made speciall choice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of it euen from all Eternity, as
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
      <hi>S. Austin</hi> teacheth from that Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call testimony of the Acts <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Him, by the determinate counsell and prescience of God, being deliuered, by the hands of wicked men you haue crucified &amp; slaine.</hi> And accordingly Christ himselfe in the beginning of his preaching said to <hi>Nicodemus Ioan.</hi> 3. <hi>As Moyses exalted the serpent in the desert, so must the Sonne of Man be exalted; that euery one, which belieueth in him, perish not, but may haue life euerlasting.</hi> In like sort our Lord often speaking to his disciples of his <hi>Crosse,</hi> did counsell them to imitation, saying: <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. <hi>He, that will come after me, let him deny himselfe, and take vp his Crosse, and follow me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Why our Lord did choose this kind of punishment, he only knoweth, who chose it: Notwithstanding there are not wanting some Misteries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the which the holy Fathers haue left to vs in Writing. <hi>Saint Irenaeus</hi> writeth, that the two armes of the <hi>Crosse</hi> do agree vnder one Title, in the which was written, <hi>Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum,</hi> that we might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thereby, the two People (to wit the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentils</hi>) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="7"/> vvere deuided, in the end were to be ioyned togeather into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vnder one Head which is Christ. <hi>S. Gregory Nyssene</hi> writeth, that part of the Crosse, vvhich looketh towards Heauen, to signify, that by the Crosse, as by a key, Heauen is opened to man; and that part of it, which declineth towards the Center of the World, to denote that Hel was spoiled by Christ, when he descended thither. The two armes of the Crosse, which are stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the East, and West, to shaddow, that the repurging of the whole World was after to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Bloud of Christ.</p>
   <p>But <hi>S. Ierome, S. Austin,</hi> and <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> do teach, that the chiefe Mistery of the Crosse is briefly touched in those vvords of the Apostle: <hi>Quae sit latitudo, longitudo, sublimitas, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum;</hi> Since (say these Fathers) that first the Attributs of God are sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in these Word, to wit, Power in height; In depth wisdome; in Latitude goodnes; in Longitude Eternity. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Vertues of Christ suffering, are adumbrated and <hi>Typically</hi> figured therein; As in Latitude <hi>Charity;</hi> in Longitude Patience; in Altitude Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="13" facs="7"/> in Profundity Humility. Lastly the Vertues, vvhich are necessary to those, who are saued by Christ, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so here signified: In depth Faith; in height Hope; in breadth <hi>Charity;</hi> in length Perseuerance. From the which we are to be instructed, that <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (vvhich deseruedly is called the Queene of Vertue) euery where hath place in God, in Christ, and in vs. But touching other Vertues, some of them are in God, others in Christ, and others in vs. And therefore it is lesse to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, if in those last Words of Christ, which vve now vndertake to explaine, <hi>Charity</hi> do obtaine the first Place.</p>
   <p>First therefore we will explicate the three first <hi>Words or Sentences,</hi> which were spoken by Christ about the sixt houre, before the Sunne was obscured, and darknes couered the whole Earth. Next we will discourse of the then defect of the Sunne. That done, we vvill explaine &amp; vnfould the rest of the Words of our Lord, which were spoken about the ninth houre, as <hi>S. Mathew</hi> writeth; to wit, when the darknes did depart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, and the death of Christ drew neare, or rather was euen at hand.</p>
