                 <title>The spirituall architecture. Or, the balance of Gods sanctuary to discerne the weight and solidity of a true and sincere, from the leuitie, and vanitie of a false and counterfeit profession of Christianity. Wherein also the sandy foundations of the papisticall faith are briefely discouered. A sermon preached at Pauls Crosse the 16. of Nouember, 1623. by Robert Barrell, Master of Arts, and minister of Gods word at Maidstone in Kent</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may bee thought too high a praesumption (and that not altogether vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) that I should seeke to shroud these my poore Labours vnder the roofe of your <hi>Gracious Patronage:</hi> which I doe not out of any confidence of the worth of them (for alasse I am too conscious to my owne wants to bee so arrogantly presumptuous) but out of the Conscience of that great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb facs="3"/> wherein I stand bound vnto your Grace for your Graces manifold vndeserued fauours, whereof I humbly desire to make this publique acknowledgement.

I write not this to flatter your Grace, for (besides that my nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres such basenesse) he needs no false and flattering praises, that abounds with true: and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith truly; A good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence neither desires praise nor feares accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

For my part, I should not haue presumed to publish to the world these my poore Labours, (which doth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion mee humbly to craue your Graces Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage) but that in these dayes, wherein so many <hi>Babilonish Tobiahs and Sanballats,</hi> seeke by all meanes to hinder, and (if they could) to ruine it, euery true hearted Israelite that can lay but one stone to further the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods Temple, &amp; the walls of his Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, must not sit idle.
