   <head>The Translator to the Judicious Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ranslations of Authors from one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to another, are like old garments turn'd into new fashions; in which though the stuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be still the same, yet the die and trimming are altered, and in the making, here something added, there something cut away: yet have I endeavoured to set forth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick the <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epodes</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> in English verse, with as little losse as may be, unlesse it be of my owne credit, who have presumed to make my gleanings more than anothers harvest, and where hee onely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered some few eares, I to bind up straw and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for you will find many <hi>Odes</hi> which have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no matter in them, as being composed by the prime author onely to shew the excellency of the Roman phrase, and verse; others mixt of words and matter; many materially excellent. I know I cannot write without the committing of many errors, somewhereof may passe undetected to many, which I my selfe may very much mislike; and some may pick a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in some things, where I intended none: others may utterly dislike, what may indifferently please me,
<pb facs="5"/>and disaffect some epithetes which I did labour for: Thus <hi>tres mihi convivae prope dissentire &amp;c.</hi> Let me give you a tasle of one or two passages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haply, perhaps unhappily I may dissent from other judgements: in the fourth <hi>Ode</hi> of the first Booke: <hi>Quo simul mearis, Nec regna vini sortiere talls,</hi> which the Commentators in my opinion doe faile in, making <hi>talis vini</hi> the adjective and substantive of the genitive case; whereas <hi>Talis</hi> is a substantive in the ablative ease; for it was a custome among the Romans, at their feasts, to cast the dice who should bee the governour of their healths drinking; and this is consonant to <hi>Horace</hi> himselfe in the seventh <hi>Ode</hi> of the second Book—<hi>Quem</hi> Venus <hi>arbitrum Dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t bibendi:</hi> for <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>jactus Venereus</hi> carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all: Another thing which I would advertise the Reader of is this, when the same word, of the same ease and gender shall beare two senses, both good; and the Translator, that cannot in his verse render both, shall bee thought ignorant in the one, as in this place; <hi>Ode</hi> thirty five of the first Book: <hi>Regum{que} matres barbarorum, Et purpurei metuunt Tyranni;</hi> where the word <hi>purpurei</hi> may bee understood of the cruelty of tyrants, whose hands are dipt in blood; or the royall clothing of Kings and Emperours in purple robes: in the former sense I have translated the words thus,</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>And barbarous Kings mothers are afeard,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>And tyrants too with purple gore besmear'd.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p> In the latter sense it may be thus rendred;</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>And barbarous kings mothers are afraid,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>And Tyrants too with purple robes araid.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>A third sort of mistake is in some whole clause or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as in the fifth <hi>Ode</hi> of the third Booke, concerning <hi>Regulus</hi> his embasie to Rome, where he saith:</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>—Signa ego Punicis</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Affixa delubris, &amp; arma</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Militibus sine caede, dixit,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Direpta vidi.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>Thus farre I understand of the base cowardize of the Roman souldiers: but for that which followeth,</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>—Vidi ego civium</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Retorta tergo brachia libero,</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>I wonder that all Commentators, that I have seene, should interpret it of the slaverie of the Romans, which is spoken of the fearlesse walking up and downe of the Carthaginian citicens with their hands behind them, after their conquest obtained: and this is evident by the next words.</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>Portasque non clausas, et arva</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Marte coli populata nostro.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p> A fourth sort of mistake is in the different pointing of a sentence, as you may see in the same Ode:</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>Si pugnat extricata densis</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Cerva plagis, erit ille fortis</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Qui perfidis fe credidit hostibus.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>Which if it be read with an interrogation, I can see us sense in it: therefore I reade it as a meere concession upon an impossibilitie, that you may as well make a Deere stay and fight valiantly, when she is escaped from the hunters toile, as a soldier once freed from his captivitie. The last sort of mistakes may be in different readings, as in the seventh Ode of the first book (to give no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) where some reade, <hi>Undique decerptam fronti praeponere olivam:</hi> I preferre that other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Undique decerptae frondem praeponere olivae:</hi> since there the Poet speakes of preferring Athens, Pallas citie, and the Olive tree sacred to her, before all other cities and trees.</p>
   <p>Take, gentle Reader, these my labours in good part; and if I in this shall give thee any contentment, I hope hereafter to increase it to thee in some other subject; whose studie in this hath been, to afford thee both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and delight.</p>
