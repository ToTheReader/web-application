   <head>The Elogie of the author, in signe of
his loyall affection, both toward his
late Soueraigne, and now regnant.</head>
   <l>The cursed crew of Iesuites,</l>
   <l>A change did long desire;</l>
   <l>A change they haue, but to their griefe,</l>
   <l>Both Pope and Spaine admire.</l>
   <l>Our noble Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
   </l>
   <l>From hence to heauen is gone;</l>
   <l>King <hi>Iames</hi> the first giuen vs of God,</l>
   <l>By right sits in her throne.</l>
   <l>Shee fourtie yeeres and foure complete,</l>
   <l>did Pope and Spaine withstand;</l>
   <l>And maugree all their bloudie plots,</l>
   <l>In peace did rule this land.</l>
   <l>Gods word and his true worshippe euer,</l>
   <l>VVith zeale shee did defend;</l>
   <l>For which cause God did her protect,</l>
   <l>Vntill her life did end.</l>
   <l>Her death perforce we must lament,</l>
   <l>VVho dearely lou'd vs all;</l>
   <l>Her bountie great, her mercie rare,</l>
   <l>The world to witnesse call.</l>
   <l>Yet English hearts be not dismaide,</l>
   <l>King Iames is our regent;</l>
   <l>Hence Poperie certes he will supplant,</l>
   <l>All falshood must relent.</l>
   <l>He will doe iustice euery where,</l>
   <l>And poore mens cause respect;</l>
   <l>The mightie must not them annoy,</l>
   <l>He will their right protect.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Poore men to him must haue accesse,</l>
   <l>Their owne cause there to tell;</l>
   <l>No bribes can haue place in his court,</l>
   <l>Thence vice he will expell.</l>
   <l>The richer sort with lingringe suites,</l>
   <l>Must not the poore oppresse;</l>
   <l>Our noble King the man of God,</l>
   <l>Their wronges will soone redresse.</l>
   <l>Christs Gospell still he will maintaine,</l>
   <l>Our true peace to prolonge;</l>
   <l>Both Spaniard, Pope, and Iesuite,</l>
   <l>May sing a doolefull songe.</l>
   <l>They sought by treason Scotlands crowne,</l>
   <l>On Spanish head to bind;</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Crichton</hi> was actor chiefe, who may</l>
   <l>in then'd an halter find.</l>
   <l>Most traytorous parts and bloudie plots,</l>
   <l>To Iesuites are deare;</l>
   <l>To all that will this booke peruse,</l>
   <l>This truth must needs appeare.</l>
   <l>Disloyall papists still presume,</l>
   <l>A tollerate to craue;</l>
   <l>But God preserue our gracious King,</l>
   <l>No such sport must they haue.</l>
   <l>Their combes are cut, their crests are falne,</l>
   <l>They stand amaz'd with feare;</l>
   <l>Their spirits rampant are made couchant,</l>
   <l>Their doome will soone appeare.</l>
   <l>For this rare blessing yeelde him thankes,</l>
   <l>That sits in heauen aboue;</l>
   <l>And let our faith and Godly life,</l>
   <l>Make knowne to him our loue.</l>
