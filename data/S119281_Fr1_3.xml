      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any of the Ancients obserue, that <hi>St. Iames</hi> perceiuing diuers vnstable Christians to sucke poison out of the sweetest flower of paradise, by misinterpreting and peruerting St. <hi>Paules</hi> most wholesome and comfortable Doctrine of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith without workes; wrote his Epistle (after a sort) purposedly to redresse that abuse, and equally (as it were) to diuide betweene faith and workes;<note place="margin">Iam. 2.21 &amp; 23</note> giuing them both their seuerall iustifications: for these two truthes may and must stand together faith iustifies our workes before God: but workes iustifies our faith before men.<note place="margin">Abacuc. 2.4.

      <hi>The iust shall liue by faith,</hi> but faith it selfe must liue by workes: for <hi>as the</hi>

That which mooued this Holy Apostle to presse so farre the necessity of workes as to attribute vnto them a kinde of iustification:<note place="margin">Iames 2.26.</note> I verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self stird vp the meek spirit of the modest and learned Author of the <hi>Triall of Faith,</hi> and this Apologie thereof so farre to inforce the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of repentance as to giue it a kind of precedency to faith in Christ: not any way to detract from the Dignity and Excellency of faith, which hee must, and doth acknowledge to be the mother and Queene of all Christian vertues,<note place="margin">August. Enchir. ad Laurent.</note>
      <hi>(Fides enim impetrat quod lex imperat)</hi> but to keepe men from bearing to much on the right hand, and sailing to neare to the dangerous rocke of presumption: vpon which it is to be feared many more ordinarily make shipwracke of faith and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then vpon the other opposit to it, of despaire, <hi>ô quam multi cum hac spe ad aeternos labores, &amp; bella des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendunt,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> how many goe to hell with a vaine hope of heauen: whose chiefest cause of damnation is their false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and groundlesse presumption of saluation.</p>
   <p>To keepe all true beleeuers from this most dangerous rocke, this Author chiefefly penned his treatise entituled <hi>The triall of Faith,</hi> wherein hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly aduiseth all that saile towards those <hi>pulchri portus,</hi> faire hauens in heauen to endeauour to steare their course in the middle way betweene the two rockes aboue named; and to this end substantially prooueth, that noe man may relie on Christ with assured hope, and confidence of saluation and remission of his sinnes before he find in himselfe a true sorrow for them, and entertaine an vnfained purpose and desire to leaue them. This I take to bee the scope and drift of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which being tried by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of Gods word hath prooued pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Doctrine, not as some haue giuen out hay and stubble, which tearmes
<pb facs="8"/> better be fit their Weake exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. I professe by weighing and pondering his positions &amp; arguments, I finde no poysonous weede to lurke vnder his whosesome leaues. If any <hi>Psylli</hi> or <hi>Marsi</hi> by any extraordinary exstractiue quality can sucke out any such venemous iuyce, I am perswaded the Author will as much distaste and detest the same as my selfe do: For I finde him ready and desirous to giue satisfaction not onely to moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers of his tenets: but also to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, and priudicat obiecters against it. <hi>hanc libertatem petimus{que} damvs{que} vicissim.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Apologist freely acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a beleefe of Christ and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to goe before the begunne repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he speaketh of: nay farther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hee professeth that faith in Christ precedeth that repentance, which the Diuines cōmonly handle in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places vnder that Title they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, therby new obedience and a setled course and measure of sanctification.
<pb facs="8"/> In which regard I aduise the violent opposers of his tenet seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether their arguments against it come home or rather in the end proue not meere <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, especially sith they cannot deny that remission of sinnes in Christs blood is no other wayes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in the Gospell then vpon condition of amendment and newnes of life.</p>
   <p>The vndertaking therefore of the performance of this condition (God enabling vs therevnto by his effectuall grace) which is a purpose of newnesse of life must needes precede the laying claime or taking to our selues the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit offered by laying hold on Christ, and relying on him for this benefit of of remission of sinnes. It is true a reward or benefit offered vpon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be challenged and iustly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued also before the condition be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but not before the condition be agreed vpon, and vndertaken to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. A man that hath a lease di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to him vpon condition to pay his
<pb facs="9"/> rent and fence the grounds may take his lease and enioy some benefit by it before hee hath performed those coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, but not before he hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by couenant to performe the same. This vndertaking of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition, <hi>viz.</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, what is it else but a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and holy promise to God of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our sinnes, which purpose he who hath not wrought in him by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, doth still and cannot but hold on his former purpose to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his sinnes: now for a man yet holding his purpose to continue in sin, to trust to Christ, or relie on him, for the remission of them, what is it else but presumption.</p>
   <p>As for many incident or consequent questions, which the nice-handling of this point may breede in refined wits; as whether, the beleefe of the Gospell, which we call Historicall faith, and a beleefe and affiance in Christ which is iustifying faith in an elect, grow into on habit, and whether a purpose of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="9"/> before; and the amendment of life, or new obedience after faith in Christ, belong to the same specificall vertue of repentance, and whether the same grace of the spirit produce faith, and repentance in the soule, or a diuerse, and whether the grace which produceth them, produce them both in the same insta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t, or diuerse, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these diuers instances must bee diuers instances of time, or of nature onely, and lastly, it being granted that faith and repentance are both produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the same instant of time and nature, whether the one beginneth to worke before the other; and whether admitting that the worke of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is first felt in the soule before any worke of a iustifying faith, yet that the worke of a iustifying faith, may not be in the nature of the thing before it, as the thunder in nature is before the lightning: yet wee see the lightning before wee heare the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
   <p>I say for these and the like subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="10"/> I hold it needlesse, and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to imploy the haruest of our time in tithing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
