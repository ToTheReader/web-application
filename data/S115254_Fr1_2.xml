      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmighty GOD hauing made your <hi>Maiesty</hi> Soueraigne ouer many strong Nations, naturally Martiall, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially exercised in Armes: Yet if they want Discipline (though many) they are but few; and though else strong, yet therefore weake. Your mighty Kingdomes also being strongly situated by Nature, Intrenched about with a broade Dike the Seas, Pallisadoed with Rockes and Sands, Sentinelled with strange setting Tydes of Ebbes and Floods, Defended by frequent Stormes and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, highly Inritched with Fertillity of Nature, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished plentiously with all manner of Matterialls fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the felicity of Mans life vpon Earth, both for time of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Warre;</hi> So that nothing can seeme to bee more wished for, if Industery bee vsed; but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if Correspondency bee found in a good and due temper betweene the Head and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as perfect Obedience and Seruice from the Members to the Head, and entire loue and care from the Head to the Members, for their good and safety. <hi>Gunnes</hi> your Maiesty hath, but want <hi>Gunners,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want Respect and Encouragement: let
<pb facs="3"/>Occasions be ruled with Reason, VVarrs managed with Discipline, Iudgement, and Pollicie: Let stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Offendors be punished, Deseruing Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, Eminent Places not granted for Fauour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Men or Strangers, hauing honest Subiects farre more able to performe the Seruice: So we shall all make Holiday to serue our <hi>God,</hi> obey our <hi>King,</hi> and enioy Gods blessings bestowed vpon vs, <hi>euery Man Eating his Grapes vnder his owne Vine,</hi> without feare of forraigne Enemies: To conclude then, nothing can be wanting, Men, Money, Meanes nor Prosperity; when the God of Order hath setled such a congruity. Now that your Maiesty may the better be prouided hereafter of vnderstanding <hi>Gunners</hi> to manage your Artillery, the powerfull Regent of moderne VVarre: I haue endeuored in this <hi>Practice of Artillery,</hi> to supply their wants the best I can, not doubting but in short time it may worke good effect therein: If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty will be gratiously pleased to countenance these few Lines vnder your Royall Patronage. My wrongs and discouragements hath hitherto hindred the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof: VVhich, if your Maiestie would be pleased to referre to be examined and relieued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; It will then appeare I had cause to speake; And I should be againe encouraged for greater and further Seruices hereafter: So most humbly crauing pardon for my boldnesse, prostrating my selfe at your Sacred Feete, as by Oath and Duty bound, will euer remaine,</p>
