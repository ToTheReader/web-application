   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to commit vnto the publique view, vnder your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's</hi> name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, a second par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Ed: Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loners</hi> Sermons. I haue quickly named the <hi>Author</hi> and the <hi>Booke,</hi> that they may bee
<pb facs="3"/>my apology for presuming to your Lordships presence, (who otherwise should easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that no shaft out of my owne quiver, nor any plume of mine, durst mount so high,) yet as I do ingeniously confesse, that there's nothing of mine owne, which I could account worthy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre mee to your <hi>Honour's</hi> notice: so do I verily beleeue, there's not any thing of this <hi>Authors</hi> composing so meane, which your <hi>Lordship</hi> will not value worthy your noble acceptation and patronage. The <hi>Reasons</hi> why I haue caus'd these <hi>Sermons</hi> to passe the presse, besides those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which induced our <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      </hi> to the publishing of the former <hi>(the good affections of some, his friends, earnestly desiring it:) first</hi> the <hi>Worth</hi> of the arguments, beeing severall choice peices of holy writ dexterously handled, and such as may well (if affection prejudice not my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) proue serviceable to the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good: <hi>Next</hi> the <hi>loue</hi> and gratefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, which I deseruedly beare to the memory of the <hi>Author</hi> deceased, joyntly excite mee thus to make him the more memorable; whilst I
<pb facs="3"/>endeavour that as by the blessing of God, his <hi>Name</hi> yet liues (and I wish his <hi>vertues</hi> too) in a <hi>Posthumus</hi> of his body: so both may surviue in these <hi>Postnati,</hi> the happie issue of his minde. VVhy, I haue dedicated, and now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to your <hi>honour,</hi> I hope you will not interpret boldnes but duty; seeing not only those generall relations, which gaue you interest in the former, continue the same to these, but a speciall right hath now more intituled you to the whole, even <hi>Iustice;</hi> challenging the worke to him, to whom the <hi>Author</hi> hath devoted himselfe in all his publique endeavours. Your <hi>Lordships</hi> countenance to the booke shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it against the <hi>Criticks</hi> rankest censure: as for the <hi>Author,</hi> he is now farther aboue their reach and venome, then the <hi>Publisher</hi> can be (though perhaps he is yet content to be) below their envy.</p>
