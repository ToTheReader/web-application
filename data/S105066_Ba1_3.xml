      <salute>Worshipfull Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>IN regard of late it was your pleasure to witnesse your loue to me by a gift, to the end that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I might account you not onely a speciall friend, but also a worthy supporter of me in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; it was most acceptable vnto mee: and as I embrace this pledge of your beneuolence, so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably I promise my selfe to be respectiue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, according as your piety and liberality deserue. Of both which towards all, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, this token is a sufficient witnesse. For the present I haue but little, which I may render for your great liberality towards mee (and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne nothing at all, were altogether a signe of an vngrateful mind) vnlesse it be this small Paper-gift. Now if I may perceiue that any gift of this kind shall be acceptable to you, I will satisfie you either with these or the like euen to the full. Farewell Worshipfull and worthy Sir: The Lord alwayes guid you with his Spirit, and vphold you with his mighty power, and euery day inrich you with the rich graces of his Spirit. </p>
