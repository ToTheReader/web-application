      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Inding these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lying aside
in my Fathers study,
whereof I conceiued
good vse might bee
made, in regard of that
Spirituall aduantage
<pb facs="3"/>
which they promised; I
obtayned of him good
leaue to send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
whereto he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himselfe the
more easily induced,
for that his continuall
and weighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this large and
busie Diocesse will not
yet afford him leasure
to dispatch those his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fixed Meditations
on the Historie of the
new Testament; In the
meane time, the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of these voluntary
and sudden thoughts of
his, shall testifie how
<pb facs="3"/>
fruitfully he is wont to
improoue those short
ends of time, which
are stolne from his
more important auoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and (vnlesse my
hopes faile mee) the
Patterne of them may
prooue not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
to others. Holy
mindes haue been euer
wont to looke through
these bodily obiects,
at spirituall, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly;
So SVLPITIVS
reports of S. MARTIN,
that seeing a Sheepe
newly shorne, he could
say; Loe here's one that
<pb facs="4"/>
hath performed that
command in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;
hauing two Coats
shee hath giuen away
one, &amp; seeing an Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
freezing in a
thinne suite of skinnes;
Loe (said hee) There
is <hi>Adam</hi> cast out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and seing a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
part rooted vp,
part whole; but eaten
downe; and part flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
hee said, The
first was the state of
Fornication, the second
of Marriage, the third
of Virginity: But what
doe I seeke any other
<pb facs="4"/>
authour, then the Lord
of Life himselfe? Who
vpon the drawing of
water from the well of
SHILO, on the day of
the great <hi>Hosanna,</hi>
tooke occasion to speak
of those Liuing waters,
which should flow frō
euery true beleeuer,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37; and vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of a bodily feast▪
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. entred into
that Diuine discourse of
Gods gracious inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vs to those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
viands of grace
and glory. Thus, mee
thinkes, we should still
<pb facs="5"/>
bee climing vp in our
thoughts, from Earth
to Heauen; and suffer
no obiect to crosse vs
in our way without
some Spirituall vse, and
application; Thus it
pleased my Reuerend
Father sometimes to
recreate himselfe, whose
manner hath beene,
when any of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
haue vnsought
offerd themselues vnto
him, presently to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

them downe; a course
which I wish had beene
also taken in many
more, which might no
<pb facs="5"/>
doubt haue beene very
profitable.</p>
   <p>These, as they are, I
send forth vnder your
Honourable Name, out
of those many respects,
which are, in an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
right, due to your
Lordship, as being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
heire to those
two singular Patrons
of my iustly Reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Father, The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
vertue of which
your noble Parents in a
gracious Succession
yeelds to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
an happy example;
which to follow is the
<pb facs="6"/>
onely way to true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
For the dayly
increase whereof here;
and the euerlasting
crowne of it hereafter,
his prayers to God shal
not be wanting, who
desires to bee
