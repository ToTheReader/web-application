   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And first, for his <hi>Ʋanitie:</hi> it is worth the considering, how euery where he couples himselfe with the Cardinall, and sometimes iets before him, sometimes behind him, like the fantasticke wooer that <hi>Ouid</hi> describes,
<q>Et modò praecedit, sequitur modò—</q>
      <hi>Places</hi> (saies he) <hi>alleadged by the Cardinall and my selfe.</hi> p. 68. <hi>The Law inter Claras alleadged both by the Cardinall and by me.</hi> p. 38. <hi>Twelue Fathers alleadged by the Cardinall and me.</hi> p. 356. The like you may see, p. 112. p. 245. and diuerse more, for I spare. Another time, as diuiding the praise betweene them two, <hi>partly by the Cardinall, and partly by me,</hi> saies he, p. 304. But most ridiculous, where he goes before him, nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, yea and enters into comparison with him too, very deftly. First, for action. <hi>Obiected</hi> (saies he) <hi>as well by me, as by</hi>

      <hi>The Bishops answer to S.

Which had beene vncouth in any, to haue associated himselfe with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other writer of fame, especially the Cardinall, where no neede was, and in a treatise no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on his, though happily falling <note place="margin">The <hi>Cardinall</hi> himselfe, hath taken as much into his Controuersies, out of other mens writings, as any: and yet is wiser then to appeale them, or to make words of thē. But no doubt the <hi>Adioynder</hi> would haue vs thinke that good wits iumpt, the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> about the inuention of the same argument.</note> into diuers the same points, which he had handled before, (as what is there in Diuinitie, which some author or other hath not forestalled? and yet wee doe not name them, nor ranke our selues with them, when we prosecute the same argument:) but more strange in <hi>F.

      </note> former flourishes import to be his owne conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. I might adde hereto his craking euery where of his <hi>Supplement,</hi> whereof this is but a ribbe, an <hi>Eue</hi> taken out of the others side, as our <hi>Prometheus</hi> intimates, <hi>As I haue noted in my Supplement,</hi> saies he, p. 15. and, <hi>As I haue shewed in my Supplement,</hi> p. 36. <hi>I haue produced in my Supplement,</hi> p. 39. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occasion in my Supplement,</hi> p. 98. So 139. 415. 417. So in many other places we are told of the <hi>Supplement,</hi> that is, by himselfe of his owne worke, (another qualitie somewhat vnusuall among writers, that are not starke madde, to beat vpon their own, especially so often) which you may thinke how good a <hi>Supplement,</hi> or how answerable to the title, when wee should not haue knowne it to be at all, but for this frequent <hi>supplie</hi> of his owne mouth. And yet for my part I neuer saw it, I consesse, neither know I any that look after it. If it be like this, no force: here is enough to make <hi>Catullus</hi> sicke, or his horse either, and once againe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke him, how he may recure his surfet with purgatiue herbes, <hi>ocymo{que} &amp; vrticâ:</hi> in the meane time crying out, <hi>O librum horribilem, at{que} pestilentem. Et haec hactenus.</hi> I speake of his <hi>Ʋanitie,</hi> as you may remember, which appeares by these two points, his marching with the Cardinall in such <note place="margin">1 2</note> wanton equipage, as hath beene shewed, and his calling out vpon his <hi>Supplement,</hi> though this also be a fruit of his most hateful <hi>Tediousnes</hi> to come in it with so often; of which anon.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The second is his <hi>Ʋirulency,</hi> which you may take vp by handfulls. I will not draine the fenne, or stand casting the ponde, I meane ransacke his booke by quoting the pages; but his <hi>Table of principall matters</hi> shall declare what I say, which himselfe hath <hi>adioyned</hi> to the end of his <hi>Adioynder;</hi> the <hi>fourth principall</hi> in the <hi>table.</hi> I omit how he strippes the <hi>Bishop</hi> of his title; And (not to say how due in all other mens iudgements, the most iudicious themselues thinking
<pb facs="9"/>
that they honour their iudgments most, when they expresse the honour that they beare to him) it was not denied to <hi>Dioscorus</hi> (I forbeare the rest, how vnsutable a man) yet drawing neere, (as he best knowes that cites the Councell <note place="margin">Adioynd. cap. 2. toto.

But what style doth he giue him, in liew of the other, which he takes from him? Let it be viewed, where I now quoted, (like <hi>Tertullians Ononychites,</hi> that he tells vs of in his <hi>Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> set vp by the Heathen, in despight of the Christians, or if euer any imagination crost the originall more fowly.) <hi>His vaine bragges, His cogging the dice, his inclining to Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme, A man prodigall of his Rhetorique, &amp;c. Yea, a wronger of his</hi> MAIESTIE, <hi>turnd plains Puritane, no friend to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.</hi> And then ouer againe with the same notes, not onely in the <hi>booke,</hi> but in the <hi>Index</hi> twice, so well they please him. <hi>Fooles bolts, Shuttlecocks, dull head, &amp;c.</hi> Finally, will you heare an heinous crime? <hi>He tryes how neare he can corne to Popery, and yet misse it:</hi> that is, graunts to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists as much as may be graunted, though by no meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the <hi>Palladium</hi> of Gods cause, multiplyes not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, where no need is, abstaines from brabbles, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as should <hi>the seruant of God</hi> (if S. <hi>Paul</hi>

   <p>Now truely hauing described to you, his description of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> wherein, besides his <hi>Virulency,</hi> (of which I now entreat,) both his <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Tautology,</hi> and almost all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that before I charged him with, euen <hi>Ignorance</hi> it selfe in the highest degree (for what more grosse <hi>ignorance,</hi> then to be ignorant of the person (not only of the generall,
<pb facs="9"/>
or of the cause) whome the farthest parts know, farre other then so? vnlesse purposely he would decypher him like <hi>Arbos inuersa,</hi> as the Philosophers say of man, or by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and abstractions, as we doe the <hi>Genij</hi> in Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siques) me thinks he hath giuen you a description of a <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite,</hi> such as a better could not be wished, that shewes you the world cleane turnd in a glasse, and presumes he can alter the very nature of things, with his poisonous breath, and partiall censure: not vnlike to their late scholler, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide of France, that conceited the king to be an <hi>Aethiop</hi>

   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third is his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and I meane onely in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue; for I will not search now his more hidden scholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; I am content to be iudged by his knowledge in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the verie portall (for so is that to learning, <hi>prima de dòtibus,</hi> or, <hi>prima de cotibus.)</hi> (And as for the <hi>Greeke,</hi> we were not best say much of that, though his <gap reason="foreign">
