   <head>Certaine Aduertisements to the Reader.</head>
   <p>THis Peece of our History, which here I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulge not, but impart priuately to such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons as haue fauoured my indeauors therein, should long since haue beene much more: and come abroade with <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Preface,</hi> and all the Complements of a Booke, had my Health and Meanes beene answerable to my desire: But being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I must intreate my Friends, to be content to be payd by peeces, as I may, and accept my willingnesse to yeeld as much as mine abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can performe. It is more then the worke of one man (were hee of neuer so strong forces) to Compose a passable contexture of the whole History of <hi>England.</hi> For, although the inquisition of Ancient times, written by others be prepared, yet the Collection and Disposition I finde most Laborious: and I know, <hi>quam sit magnum dare ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in manus hominum,</hi> especially in this kinde, wherein more is expected then hath beene deliuered before. Curiosity will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Ordinaries. For mine owne part I am so greedy of doing well, as nothing suffices the appetite of my care herein. I had rather be Master of a small peece handsomely contriued, then of vaste roomes ill proportioned, and vnfurnished: and I know many others are of my minde.</p>
   <p>Now for what I haue done, which is the greatest part of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story (and wherein, I dare auow, is more together of the mayne, then hath beene yet contracted into one peece) I am to render an account whence I had my furniture: which if I haue omitted to charge my Margin withall, I would haue the Reader to know, that in the Liues of <hi>William</hi> the First, <hi>William</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the First, and
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Stephan;</hi> I haue especially followed <hi>William Malmsbury, Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Roger Houueden, Huntingdon,</hi> with all such Collections, as haue beene made out of others for those times. In the Liues of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, <hi>Richard</hi> the First, <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third: <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis, Rushanger, Mat. Paris, Mat. Westminst. Nich. Triuet, Caxton,</hi> and others. In the Liues of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and Third: <hi>Froissart</hi> and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> with such collections as by <hi>Pollidore Virgile, Fabian, Grafton, Hall, Holingshead, Stow</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> dilligent and famous Trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in the search of our History, haue beene made and diuulged to the world. For forrayne businesses (especially with <hi>France,</hi> where we had most to doe) I haue for Authors, <hi>Paulus AEmilius, Haillan, Tillet,</hi> and others, without whom we cannot truely vnderstand our owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And where otherwise I haue had any supplyes extraordinary, either out of Record, or such Instruments of State, as I could procure, I haue giuen a true account of them in the Margin. So that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall be sure to be payd with no counterfeit Coyne, but such as shall haue the Stampe of Antiquitie, the approbation of Testimony, and the allowance of Authority, so farre as I shall proceed herein.</p>
   <p>And for that I would haue this Breuiarie to passe with an vn-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted deliuery of the especiall affaires of the Kingdome (without imbroyling the memory of the Reader) I haue in a body apart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of an <hi>Appendix,</hi> Collected all Treaties, Letters, Articles, Charters, Ordinances, Intertainments, prouisions of Armies, businesses of Commerce, withother passages of State appertayning to our History; which assoone as I haue meanes to Print, shall, for the better satisfying of such Worthie persons, as may make vse of such Materials, accompany this Collection: and to this <hi>Appendix,</hi> I haue made references in the Margin, as occasion requires.</p>
   <p>For the Worke it selfe I can chalenge nothing therein but only the sowing it together, and the obseruation of those necessary circumstances, and inferences which the History naturally ministers: desirous to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things done, in as euen, and quiet an order, as such a heape will permit, without quarrelling with the <hi>Beliefe</hi> of Antiquity, deprauing the actions of other Nations to aduance our owne, or keeping backe those Reasons of State they had, for what they did in those times: hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it fittest and best agreeing with integritie (the chiefest duty of a Writer) to leaue things to their owne Fame, and the Censure thereof
<pb facs="4"/>
to the Reader, as being his part rather then mine, who am onely to recite things done, not to rule them.</p>
   <p>Now for the errors herein committed, either by mine owne mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, or the Printers ouersight, I must craue a pardon of course, it is a Fate common to Bookes and Booke-men, and wee cannot auoide it: For besides our owne faylings, wee must heere take vp many things vpon other mens credits, which often comes imperfect to our hands: as the summes of Monies, numbers of Souldiers, Shippes, the slaine in Battayle, Computation of Tymes, differences of Names and Tytles &amp;c. wherein our Authors agree not. And it were to bee wished that wee had more assured notes of these particulars then wee haue, especially for summes of Monies (in regard it serues much for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction) wherein I doubt many of our Collectors haue beene but ill Acountants, reckoning Markes for Pounds, and Pounds for Markes. The Computation of Tymes is not of so great moment, figures are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaken, the 10. of Iuly, and the 6. of August, with a yeare ouer or vnder, makes not a man the wiser in the businesse then done, which is only that hee desires. But these things being but of the By, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Reader will not much care to set at them, and therefore I referre him to the Mayne of more important consideration.</p>
