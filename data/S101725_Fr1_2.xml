   <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHERS IN GOD, TOBIE, THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORKE HIS GRACE, Primate and Metropolitane of England: <hi>and to</hi> GEORGE, Lord Bishop of Chester: his very good Lords.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first pēned this Treatise, which now I offer to your Lordships, I did it for mine owne priuate exercise, and the satisfying of certaine friends that desired it. Afterward seeing some hope that it might doe good abroad, principally in the countrey where I dwell: and desirous, if it were possible, to do any thing that might helpe the seduced out of their errors, and confirme the rest in the truth, I was easily perswaded to put it forth; and the rather for that the questions handled, touching <hi>THE AVTHORITIE AND SENCE OF THE SCRIPTVRE,</hi> and <hi>SIGNES OF THE CHVRCH,</hi> are the profitablest that can be stood vpon, and such as I haue alway obserued our people commonliest vse, and most desire to looke into; not being able to apprehend the difference, or iudge of the reasons in other
<pb facs="3"/> questions; but presuming that if by certain marks they could find which is the true Church, there would remaine litle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie in the rest, forsomuch as therein they should find the truth in euery controuersie.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2</hi> The proper cause why our aduersaries put this deuice into the peoples heads, was to dazle their eyes, and delude their sences with the name of <hi>THE CHVRCH;</hi> that when they should find the word of God, and all discourse against their opinions, yet that name should amaze them, while they might beleeue nothing vntill they were perswaded, by other marks, that it came from the <hi>CHVRCH.</hi> And no doubt this is the<note n="a" place="margin">Apollodor. Bibliothec. li. 2.</note> Gorgons head that inchanteth and oppresseth them, euen the learnedst of them all, and holdeth them in bondage to their errors, hauing a conceit that they wil heare nothing against the Church: which they presuming to be the Papacy (though it be but <hi>AN IMPOSTVME BRED IN THE CHVRCH,</hi> or <hi>A DISEASE GROWING TO IT</hi>) will go no further. All their speech is of the Church: no mention of the Scriptures, or God their Father, but their <hi>MOTHER THE CHVRCH.</hi> Much like as<note n="b" place="margin">Solin. poly. hist. c. 33.</note> they write of certaine Aethiopians, that <hi>by reason they vse no mariage, but promiscuously companie together, it cometh that the children onely follow the mother: the fathers name is in no request, but the mother goeth away with all the reputation.</hi> Let their talke be listened, and their bookes perused, and it will appeare, this authoritie of their Church is at the end of euery question, and striketh the stroke: as<note n="c" place="margin">Philostrat. in imaginib.</note> one saith pleasantly of Aesops Fables, that <hi>therein the Foxe is the chiefe stickler of all the company.</hi> The beasts seldom meet but he is among them, and beareth his part with the busiest.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3</hi> This matter is handled in this Booke betweene my aduersarie and me. For though others haue done the same
<pb facs="3"/> before me, yet I haue done it in mine owne method. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all one, but the vessell wherein I haue brought it, is my owne. And it was the iudgement of<note n="d" place="margin">Trinit. l. 1. c. 3. &amp; de Menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio. c. 6.</note> Saint Austine, that <hi>In places infected with heresie, all men should write that had any facultie therein, though it were but the same things in other words; that all sorts of people, among many bookes, might light vpon some, and the enemie, in all places, might find some to encounter him.</hi> The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, which are the Popes Ianizaries that guard his person, and were brought in now at the last cast, when the state of the Papacie was at a dead lift, to support the waight of the maine battell, haue pestered the land with their writings, and filled the hands and pockets of all sorts of people with their papers; yea fannes and feathers are lapped vp in them; wherein it is admirable to see how presumptuously they take vpon them, in disgracing our persons, belying our doctrine, and coining and defending strange opinions of their owne, neuer heard of afore; as if Chrysippus schoole had bred them,<note n="e" place="margin">Diog. Laert. in Chrysip.</note> who vsed to make his boast, <hi>that many times he wanted opinions to aduance, but if once he had the opinion, he neuer wanted arguments to defend it:</hi> whose writings, seeing they cannot be suppressed, pitie but they were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally answered. The applause that ignorant and vnsetled minds giue them, and the conquest that of late yeares they haue made of a few Libertines and discontented persons, hath so fleshed them, that it is incredible how they brag and sing, like<note n="f" place="margin">Auentin. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib. 2.</note> the clownes of Germany, when they had expelled the Franks:
<q>
         <l>Mille Francos, mille Sarmatas semel occidimus:</l>
         <l>Mille, mille, mille, mille, mille Persas quaerimus.</l>
      </q> But I dare boldly say it, that if the maner how they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed be looked into,<note n="g" place="margin">Praescript:</note> Tertullians speech will fall out to be
<pb facs="4"/> true, <hi>It is the weaknesse of some that giueth them the victory, being able to do nothing when they encounter an able faith.</hi> Discontent and vanitie of mind, voide of the knowledge and faithfull practise of religion, are good dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to heresie. <hi>They liue Gentiles,</hi> saith Cyprian, <hi>and die heretickes.</hi>

      <hi>4</hi> A singular misery no doubt, and aboue all other to be lamented, that mans mind so free, so ready, so able, with those helpes that God hath left him, to search out the truth, yet should not be satisfied, nor rest contented with heauen and earth, or any other thing that God hath reuealed for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof: but suffereth it selfe to fall into opinions, and with the conceits thereof, as it were with irons and fetters, like a prisoner to be shut vp in the bottome of a lothsome dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where they can find nothing but the crawling of blind error, and vnsetled opinions, and irksome vncertainties, as vermine creeping round about them.

In the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
<pb facs="5"/> of the world, the secular Lordship is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary either of pure, or meere, or expedient necessitie; but when the Church cannot. Resoluing this article therefore, we say, that in all the world there is but one Lordship, and therefore there must be but one vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall and supreame Prince and Monarch; who is Christs Vicar, according to that of</hi>

Whereby it appeareth, <hi>IT IS NOT RELIGION THEY STRIVE FOR, BVT SOVERAIGNTIE:</hi> and not the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, yeelding to their ceremonies and superstitions, will satisfie them, vnlesse they may also haue their willes in ouerruling all, and the Crownes of Princes, and the Scepters and subiects of the Kings of the world be at their deuotion. Whereby they haue branded themselues for euer with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleble character of the Ministers of Antichrist: that being but Priests, and confined to their bookes, and hauing<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 16.19. &amp; ibi Ferus. § Tertiò obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uandum &amp; illud quòd signanter dicit.</note> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commission but <hi>TO PREACH AND TEACH,</hi> yet thus they creepe into thrones, filling the world with Anarchy and confusion; and whose soules they should winne to God by ministring the word and sacraments, their bloud they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the diuell, by stirring them vp to treason and rebellion, and canonize them for <hi>MARTYRS</hi> when they haue done. We thinke it lamentable that is<note n="s" place="margin">Anton. Magin geograph. pag. 168.</note> written of the great Turk, how at Constantinople, in the place that sometime was the pallace of Constantine, now he keepeth fierce Elephants, and a thousand other cruel beasts: and in a stately Church neer to adioyning, where God was wont to be honored, he feedeth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage

Elizabeth and his Maiestie and aboue all other the Powder trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Nouemb. <hi>1605.</hi>
      </note> This is the practise of the Man of Rome: in the pallace of Constantine, where formerly of old, godly Bishops had wont to be entertained, he stalleth vp purpled Machiavellians, and vnreasonable beasts to prey vpon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantines successors, and deuoure the Princes of the earth: and to euery pillar of our Churches welnigh in Europe, he chaineth Wolues and Libards to flie at our throates, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we come within their reach. And those heards that we see of Friers, Seminaries, Masse-priests, Iesuites, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be the Pastors of our soules, be nothing else but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Beares and bloudie Tygers, chained to the pillars of our Churches, the fatall enemies of Princes and their people, to suck their bloud: saue that the Turks lions at Constantinople <hi>with feeding and familiaritie of their keepers become tame and gentle;</hi> but the Popes sauages of Rome by no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance or mercie shewed them can be mollified: no gentle vsage can tame their nature; no clemencie will reconcile them, no diet will swage their thirst of bloud; no benefits, no patience, no endurance can alter their hearts from practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against their mercifullest Prince, and dearest countrey.

   <p n="6">
      <hi>6</hi> There is but one way to preuent the danger that may he feared from this generation and their practises: and that is, that sinne be seuerely punished, and a preaching ministery setled, as much as is possible, in all places of the land, and painfull preaching effectually maintained against the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold discouragements of this iron age, whereby the subiect may be taught obedience, and ignorance and superstition (the roote of disloyaltie) may be expelled; that slie Papists, specially those of the better sort, be met with, and not suffered with cunning and friendship to slide through the fingers of the Magistrate: that besides all other courses vsed to bridle them, they be reuoked to continual conference with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are euery way fit to encounter the reputed learning of their Seminaries, and to lay the vain rumor of it: that finally his Maiestie and the State, vpon all occasions, be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against the manifold dangers and troubles, which (to the exceeding griefe of all good subiects) their gracious care ouer the Church, and Zeale against false religion, bringeth vpon them; and that by deuoting our selues to their obedience, and expressing our contentment in their gouernment, they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to proceed and take heart for euer in the faith and profession which the sacred lawes of our land and the mercy of God haue hitherto vpholden to vs, and vnder which we haue liued so happily, and obtained such strange deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against all our enemies. The persons that must do this, are your Lordships, and the rest of your place, the Fathers of the Church, whose seates were first erected, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="6"/> for such very purposes. No contradiction nor contentiō must weary you, no peace must make you secure, no opposition dismay you. The chiefe magistrates of our state are properly in your hands, to frame their conscience, to direct their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, to stirre them to action: the inferior sort of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy meddle not with this charge; it is your Lordships, to whom the cure belongeth. The vigilancy, Zeale and courage of the Primitiue Bishops (to say nothing of our Grindals, Iewels, Pilkintons, and other famous Prelats of our time, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships predecessors) was admirable in these businesses: after God once blessed them with an orthodoxal magistrate to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, there could no heresie harbour vnder them, but they draue it out. They were faithfull Fathers to the Church, and Tutors to Emperours, and by their Zeale and courage made the names of <hi>METROPOLITAN</hi> and <hi>BISHOP</hi> the most gratefull and honorable titles in the world; that euery toung pronounced them with ioy, and euery heart affected them with contentment; when the negligence and securitie of some that succeeded in after times, gaue the first occasion to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at it, and depraue it.</p>
