                 <title>A dreame of the diuell and Diues : Most terrible and fearefull to the seruantes of Sathan, but right comfortable and acceptable to the children of God. Plainely described by way of dialogue, verie necessarie to be read aduisedly, and heard attentiuelie, both of rulers and inferiours, rich, and poore, younge and olde, wise and simple, that wish rather to dwel in heauen, then in hell</title>

   <p>THough some (right Honorable) haue with no smal industry &amp; study set forth bookes &amp; pamphlets most false, yea and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, for the seducing of the simple, &amp; hurt of many, &amp; also though diuers do daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish fond &amp; fantastical bookes, neither tēding to the publike profit, nor common commodity of any, but only to feede the foolish fancies of fond heads: yet I, as Christian charitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, &amp; as one that detesteth such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; erronious writing, and vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable inditing, haue now in this perillous time, when no good admonition wil be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither any godly thing practised, of very zeale, set forth a dreadfull dreame of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell &amp; Diues, to terrifie the wicked, to feare the faithlesse, and to stay the Atheistes and the sinfull worldlings from going to hell, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that many are so diuellishly bent &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard God so little, that they will not be the better for it, but weigh it rather as a false &amp; foolish dreame, (who if there be any such as I feare there be too many) wil wish they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="3"/>
warning therby, if they come once in hel, and though the booke seeme little and light, yet the matter therein contained is of great importance &amp; weight, if our euerlasting sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and damnation, and the losing of the kingdome of heauen and the winning of the dungeon of hell, may be so counted: a more curious worke and cunningly contriued I might haue penned, but a more necessarie booke I could not haue published: and as the same is most worthy to be marked and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, euen so I thought meete to dedicate it to your honour being a zealous and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, trusting your Lordship will not onelie pardon my boldnes herein (though I so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a person and vnknowne of your honour, haue so rashly presumed:) but also that you will respect the gift, not the Giuer: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not the penning: and the marke that I shoote at, and not my vnskilfull shooting, and thus briefly I commit your honour to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, whose mercie is maruellous, whose power is infinite, &amp; whose loue doth exceede.</p>
