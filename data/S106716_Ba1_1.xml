      <body>
         <p>WHAT malice, Inuy, and heatrent of
the treuth, hes moued men to brust
furth against me &amp; my behauour, in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Ingland, and elles where: I lytle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde.
For a good cōscience susteanes me,
before my God, against all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> odious lies,
that haue bene laide to my charge, now
many yeares past. For the whiche I dout
not, but the blaspheamers shall answer:
(onles repentance preuene Iudgement)
when the secreates of heartes shalbe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed.</p>
         <p>The caus that I adde this imperfyte
letter, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> former discourse is, That they
whome Sathan hath not blinded by inuy,
may see and vnderstand, what a troubled
conscience craues, into the day of battell.
Becaus that God now in his mercy hath
put end, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> battell of my deare Mother
Maistres Elizabeth Bowes, before that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>
put end to my wretched lyfe: I could not
cease, but declare to the worlde, what was
the caus of our great familiaritie, and long
acquentance. Whiche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>as nether fleshe
<pb facs="41"/>
nor bloode, but a troubled consciēce vpō
hir part, which neuer suffered her to rest,
but when she was in the company of the
faithful: of whome (fra the first hearing of
the word at my mouth) she iudged me to
be one. Now seing her battell is ended, &amp;
I am vpō the point shortly to follow: this
I leaue to the posteritie, for discharge of
my conscience, and to the instruction of
her children. That in Scotland, Ingland,
France and Germanie, I haue heard the
complaintes of diuers that feared God:
but of the lyke conflict as she susteyned,
fra the tyme of her first acquentance and
long before (as her owen mouth, ofter thē
ones, confessed to me) til this hour, I haue
not knowen. For her tentation was not in
the fleshe, nor for any thing that appertey
ned to fleshe: (no not when she was in
greatest desolation) but it was in spirite.</p>
         <p>For Sathan did continually buffette her, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
remission of sinnes in Christ Iesus apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
nothing vnto her, be reason of her
former Idolatrie and other iniquities: For
the which notwithstanding any worldlie
comfort, I haue sene her (not for a starte,
but in long cōtinuance) powre furth tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and send to God dolorous cōplaints,
<pb facs="41"/>
ofter then euer I heard man or woman in
my lyfe. Her company to me was cōfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
(yea honorable and profitable, for
she was to me and myne a Mother) but
yet it was not without some Croce: For
besydes trouble and fasherie of body, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyned
for her: my mynde was seldome
quyet, for doing somewhat, for the cōfort
of her troubled conscience. Whereof this
rude letter is the least, and of basest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
amongs many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

            </gap>hich ly besyde me,
and so must do, be reason of my inabilitie
in mo sortes then one. I hartly salute &amp;
take my goodnight, of all the faithfull in
bothe the Realmes: earnestly desyring y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
assistance of their prayers, that without
any notable sclander to the Euangell of
Iesus Christ I may end my battell. For as
the worlde is wearie of me: so am I of it.</p>
