   <head>The VVhy and the
VVherefore.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue published this
Pamphlet, to let my
rich debters vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that as often as
I meete them, I doe
looke that they should
pay mee: and although I am shamefaste
in not asking my due, yet I would not
haue them shamelesse in detaining it from
<pb facs="7"/>
me, because the summes are but small, and
very easie for them (in generall) to pay,
and would doe me a particular good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</p>
   <p>Secondly, I haue sent this into the world,
to informe some, that though their want
doe shun and auoyd my sight and company,
that they are much deceiued in my disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for I euer did esteeme an honest heart
and a willing minde, as well as their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, there are some great men, who
by reason of their extraordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
my small acquaintance, and lesse
meanes of accesse vnto them, with my
<pb facs="7"/>
want of impudency, and their mens want
of courtesie to informe them; all these are
lets, and demurres, against my satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Lastly, the daily abuses that I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the booke of my Trauels, wherein
I am accused for lies, and falsifications;
but I doe and euer will stedfastly stand to
the truth of euery tittle of it, except the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
that I did to Maister <hi>Hilton</hi> at
<hi>Daintree;</hi> &amp; that was not done on known
malice neither, but on blinde ignorant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
and there is a second Edition
of my bookes of Trauels comming forth,
wherein I will Satyrize, Cauterize, and
Stigmatize all the whole kennell of curres
<pb facs="8"/>
that dares maliciously snarle against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
apparant, and well knowne truthes.
In the meane space, you that are my deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if you please to pay me, you shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
put your selues out of a bad number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which you yet are placed: if you
wil not pay me, take this bone to gnaw vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That I do hope to be euer better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with mony, then you shall bee with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</p>
