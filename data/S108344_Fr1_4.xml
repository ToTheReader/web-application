      <item>That Popish praier for the dead hath no warrant from the ancientest church, sec. 7.</item>
      <item>That the sacrifice of the Masse is contradicted by the scriptures and Fathers, that Bellarmin himself in seeking to approue it, ouerthroweth it; that the exceptions that are made against our reasons and proofes, are vaine and friuolous, sect 4. 9. 10.</item>
      <item>That Theodoret and Gelasius, in disputing against the he esie of Eutyches, do verie peremptorily determine against Transubstantiation sect 11. 12.</item>
      <item>That Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Austen, do manifestly impugne the same er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Transubstantiation, with a declaration of an obscure place alleaged vnder▪ Austens name, and a refutation of other exceptions that are made in the behalfe thereof. sect. 13. 14 15. 16. 17 18. 21. 22.</item>
      <item>That the expounding of <hi>the descending of Christ into hell,</hi> of the torments &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of his soule, conteineth, as touching the doctrine thereof, nothing but the truth witnessed both by the scriptures and by the Fathers. sest. 15.</item>
      <item>That our sacraments are rightly called <hi>seales,</hi> and in what respect they are preferred before the sacraments of the old Testament, sect. 20. 30.</item>
      <item>That the reall eating and drinking of the flesh and blood of Christ is a leaude deuise, and iudged by the Fathers to be wicked, profane, faithlesse, and heathenish, and that the words of Christ, of <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> Iob. 6. are not to be vnderstood proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but by a figure. sect. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 30.</item>
      <item>That the Doctours of the Romish church by the defence of Transubstantiation haue bene driuen to most impious and damnable questions and assertions. sect. 29.</item>
      <item>That the place of the Gospell Luc. 22. 20. which they so much cauil vpon out of the Greeke, maketh nothing at all for Transubstantiation, as by diuerse other reasons, so by the confession Bellarmine himselfe. sect 31.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>That the assumption of the virgin Mary,</hi> is a meere fable sect. 33.</item>
      <item>That the Church hath no authoritie after the Apostles, to authorize any scriptures and that we seclude no other bookes from the canon of the bible, then the old church did. sect. 34.</item>
      <item>How wickedly the Papists deale in mangling and martyring the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. sect. 35.</item>
      <item>That our doctrine of <hi>iustification before God by faith onely,</hi> is the verie trueth which both the scriptures and out of them, the Fathers haue manifestly taught: that it maketh nothing against good workes: that the place of S. Iames, cap. 2. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing against it. sect. 36.</item>
