      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Amentable and perilous, are these times and dayes wherein we now liue, to see the abounding of sinne and iniquity, and pure religion, to the corrupt hearts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable fantasies of men, to be wrested, as they list, to finde diuersitie of Religions, Sects and Schismes, as the hearts, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and manners of men differ, thereunto they equiuolate their profession and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the which instability, wherein there should not in the least manner be any inconstancie, breedes corrupt liues, and vnrecoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable downfalls, of many hopefull young Gentlemen, worshipfully descended, and carefully tutered, the true meanes of preuenting such horrible wickednesse. Of which duly considering, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in my minde, it did in some measure perswade me to a periode of this by mee now published, before I had put penne to paper, to write, being daily experienced, that where one suckes honey, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth, and thence sucketh poyson; for it is a thing most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to please the humours and fantasies of all men. But when I remembred the cause I had to handle, which was for the publique good of my Countrey, to admonish them to take heede by other mens hurts and harmes, and for feare it should slip out of their mindes, This person <hi>Francis Robinson,</hi> his haynous act most remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and deplorable downefall, becomes my subiect, to write; insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating mee thereunto, and encouraging mee, not to neglect my intended and good determination to a generality, for feare of the barking and contradicting spirits of our age, but to performe
<pb facs="4"/>
the cause and quarrell which I must write of against God and our enemies, how by a rauening Wolfe, a Romish Catholike, as he was blinded, became a blind guide to this poore Gentleman, to make him fall into the same ditch as he did, whereby like a silly simple inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambe by his subtill slie seducings, and inticings, his destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction befell most suddaine and fearefull. I leaue what I shall relate vnto thee to thy construction, desiring (if I may) to haue a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table censure of thee: Concluding with my hearty affection to thee, &amp; Christian admonition, howsoeuer thine is to me-ward. <hi>Stand fast in thy faith, profession, and religion,</hi> and I pray God, that other mens harmes, may make thee and all others, fearefull, carefull, and watchfull, that you fall not in such manner as many before this day haue done: the vndoubted preuention whereof is, daily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate Gods grace from aboue, to ayde and assist thee, that thou fall not into the same mischiefes, who are as weake, fraile, and subiect to be tempted, as others before thee were. And thus with heartie prayers to God to assist thee to be a conquerour in the day of battell, and constant in the time and day of triall: I rest;</p>
