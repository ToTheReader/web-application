   <head>TO THE READER.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader: In these later and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser times, wherein (as the Heathen of old complained) <hi>Malunt disputare homines quàm viuere:</hi> Men delight rather to argue and discourse of piety and Religion, then seriously to reduce the principles thereof into practice and action: It is much to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we all feare God too little; and it may iustly be suspected, that too many stand so affected in these dayes of long peace, as the Romans did in the time of their ciuill warres: Then some followed <hi>Caesar,</hi> and they were weakest; some <hi>Pompey,</hi> and they were thought wisest; some <hi>Crassus,</hi> and they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worst: So now some follow the flesh, and are led by her corrupting allurements; some are Fauorites and Minions of the world, carried away with its glittering preferments; some are meere Factors for the diuell, fulfilling his crafty-cruell designements; all are set on worke, but vnder the Commander of this cursed <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi> for the most part so wickedly, that euery where there is a consumption of grace, through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of sinne; piety complaining that shee is sicke, charity neere dead, good workes buried, prayer and preaching neglected, honesty and sobriety derided, iustice and equity abandoned, truth and plaine-dealing
<pb facs="5"/> imprisoned, faith and a good conscience banished and driuen out of the Countrey: For the recalling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from banishment, or rather, for the inciting of Christians to giue thereunto better entertainment, I had (I confesse) some extraordinary calling to those places where these Sermons were preached, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more then ordinarily laboured, to worke by them powerfully on the consciences of my Auditors, that they might be truly inlightened and inliued. To this purpose my desire and study was (as the circumstances of persons, time, and place required) to lay the Axe of Gods Word close to the root, and to apply my doctrine home to the heart, and so to set conscience it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke.</p>
   <p>Now the whole and intire worke of conscience (to giue by the way some light to the ignorant herein) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, as I conceiue it, in a practicall Syllogisme: the maior and proposition whereof ariseth from the <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresis</hi> or treasury of morall principles, and of sacred rules wherewith the practicall vnderstanding is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, for the sauing direction of vs in all actions. The minor or assumption is properly Syneidesis-conscience, that is, an actuall application of our knowledge, to this or that particular act or obiect; whence followes the immediate and necessary issue and office of conscience; to testifie in respect of things simply done, or not done; in respect of things to be done, either to excite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, or to restraine and bridle; in respect of things done well, or wickedly, to excuse and comfort, or accuse and terrifie.</p>
   <p>As for example: thus it reasoneth against lying; Euery lyar shall be banished from the holy Mountaine
<pb facs="5"/> of the Lord, and barred out of the new Ierusalem, as the Synteresis, from Psal. 15. and Reu. 21. supplyeth the proposition. But I haue thus and thus lyed for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, as the conscience of the lyar telleth him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the assumption. Therefore I shall be banished from the holy Mountaine of the Lord, &amp;c. A conclusion full of terrour. And as the liar is thus of his sinne, and punishment due vnto the same, conuinced; So the vpright liuer, on the other side, may thus by consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences-reasoning be comforted: Euery one that desireth in heart, and indeuoureth in life, to walke vprightly before God and men, shall rest in Gods holy Hill: But I, as the conscience of the godly man telleth him, doe thus desire and indeuour to walke vprightly: Therefore I shall rest in Gods holy Hill. A conclusion full of life and consolation. God grant vs such consciences as may inable vs to make such conclusions. To this principall end, haue my poore indeuours, in this ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, been especially directed; wherein, because I know this age to be full of science, penurious of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Gods schoole to be more of affection then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: therefore haue I the lesse studyed by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of choyce doctrines, to giue edge to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accounting it more necessary to be instant in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and frequent in the vse and application of some few pregnant poynts, for the whetting vp of the will and affection to holy duties, and warming of the heart with liuely deuotion in the practice of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Glad I would be, If I could but bring a pin or two, towards the decking of Christs Spouse, whilest others, out of their abundance, adorne her with costly Robes, and rich ornaments. Howsoeuer it be, I haue done my
<pb facs="6"/> best, by the assistance of his grace, to the praise of his glory, and according to the nature of my Text, haue often and earnestly pressed vpon Christians this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duty of expressing in their conscionable conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the sauing power of inward sanctimony, and the truth of a sound conuersion, aiming here and there, and euery where, generally at this, that the slumbring conscience might be awaked, the erronious better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the tender confirmed, the sad and heauie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and all, some way or other benefited. Which benefit of my vnworthy labours, if any any way haue obtained, let the goodnesse of God be duly glorified and praised; and in their best vowes and prayers for the family of the faithfull, let me, his vnworthiest seruant, be remembred. In hope hereof I rest theirs, and</p>
