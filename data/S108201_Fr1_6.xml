      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> know not whether be greater</hi>
the hardinesse of the <hi>Resolued Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
(of whom this booke entreats)
in his combates, or my presumption, in
dedicating it vnto your Maiestie, for
so small a seruice, caryeth with it so
great a disproportion, that I feare, my
good intention shalbe accompted rashnesse, in presenting so
meane a trauayle, to so high a greatnesse.</p>
   <p>But two thinges did chiefly encourage mee to publish it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the glorious name of your Maiestie: The one, in respect
of the conformitie of the discourse vnto your Maiesties ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
in whom aboue all the Princes of your tyme, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and practise of true Christian and militar discipline
chiefly florisheth: The other, of communicating vnto those
of my nation these my poore paynes, in translation of this
Treatise, which though it be lytle, yet yf they do attentiuely
reade and marke it, they shall therein finde an excellent hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
treasure, shewing in deede the very marke, whereto the
perfection of all vertue tendeth.</p>
   <p>It was first written in French by a Gentleman of great
worthynesse, noble aswell in letters, as in armes: His intention
was, to discourse of the dangerous warres made vnto vs by
our Senses, touchyng diuers passages of age, thorow which we
runne, or rather to speake more properly, are by disorders vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
caried. And so vnder the figure of bodily combates,
he layeth the spirituall so lyuely before our eyes, as cannot but
<pb facs="6"/>
draw the well-iudging Reader, to great consideration of our
frayle estate. The translation hath not been altogeather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some hardnesse, for that as the tongues are dyuers, so is
their style and maner of phrase exceedingly different. I haue
left out some thynges expressed by the Authour, as being hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
peculiarly concernyng himselfe and his Countrey, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vnknowen, and vnnecessary to vs: and in their place,
haue inserted others of more moment, and more famously
knowen, not onely to our owne nation, but to all the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
which I haue not done onely by myne owne aucthoritie,
but ioyntly by aduise of men of good iudgement, and great
skilfulnesse in eyther tongue. But my intention being rather
to prayse the Booke, then to endeere the translation: I say, that
it is such, that both in myne, and other mens iudgementes,
it deserueth your Maiestes protection. And so with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse.
I kisse your Imperiall handes.</p>
