   <head>TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, IAMES BY THE GRACE OF GOD, OF GREAT BRITAINE, France and Ireland King, and ouer all persons, and in all causes as well Ecclesiasticall as ciuill, in these his dominions, next and immediatly vnder God, Supreme Gouernor, and defender of the ancient, Catholike and Apostolike Faith.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Igh and mightie Monarch, and my most dread &amp; gratious Soueraigne, being one of them, that by your most Honorable Councels letters, in your Maie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sties name, were called to be before your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, at the conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and receiuing there such satisfaction as I did by your excellent Maiesties owne most readie and apt answers to the doubts and obiections there and then proposed: as I could not but then greatly reioyce in my heart, and praise and magnifie the Lord for the same, so euer since, though to the better satisfying of all others, I haue not onely in my practise accordingly yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vniuersall conformitie, but priuately by word and writing also haue laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb facs="3"/>all whom I haue met with, to do likewise: yet seeing and obseruing so many stil to refuse, I could not but think it my bounden dutie to God and his Church first, &amp; then to your highnesse, by writing some short Treatise to doe the best that I could, to further your most gracious &amp; christian purpose, resolution, &amp; determination in the said conferēce, which was (as I conceiued it) by your most princely moderation, &amp; resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, first of al in our home controuersies amongst our selues about our Churches Liturgie or Hierarchie, so to knit vs all together in vnitie, &amp; verity, as that al our forces hereafter might more strongly be bent &amp; employed against our common aduersaries, so the better also after to draw them to conformity with vs in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and profession of our true and pure religion. And therfore now wel nigh two yeares ago, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing writ this Treatise, and finding that the priuat vse therof, though it hath done good with som, yet to that purpose could reach but to a few, it hauing in this time comd &amp; bene in the view of some of the most reuerend Bish. &amp; so hauing
<pb facs="3"/>also got allowāce by authority to be printed, &amp; hereupon hauing bene by thē and many others which haue sene &amp; read the same, much vrged to publish it, I am bound thus to dedicate it to your Maiesty, &amp; so to offer it to the sight of all, who shalbe pleased to read it. And the rather I thought iustly I might so do, for that the ground of most of that I haue said therin to the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my brethren, arises frō the speeches, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, &amp; determinations that your highnes self gaue in the forsaid cōference. But indeed I must needs confesse, I durst not yet thus far haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured, but vpon comfortable remēbrāce of your Mai. vouchsafing the next morning after the said cōference to send for me, &amp; thē to giue me that most gratious coūtenāce &amp; most princely kind words that you thē did, in cōsideration of a book that your highnes vnderstood I had writtē, &amp; bin in some trouble for in her Ma. time that last was, touching succession. Pardon me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most gracious soueraign if to testify in some
<pb facs="4"/>measure my loyalty and thankefulnes for the same, I venture now againe into your highnesse presence, with so small a present as this. For you being pleased to accept the same, &amp; to giue it passage thus vnder your most roial patronage and protectiō, to the end aforesaid, vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it wil &amp; may much the sooner get liking and entertainment withall, &amp; so also giue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction and contentment to all them whersoeuer it finds the same. Thus therefore once againe most humbly crauing pardon for this my great boldnes, &amp; hoping of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties fauorable acceptance hereof, &amp; most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly vpon the knees of my soule begging of the almighty, that your Highnes &amp; your most royall issue may most happily &amp; prosperously reign &amp; rule ouer vs, while the Sun &amp; Moon endure, to his most gracious protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your Maiestie now and euer. From Bletchley in Buckinghamshire. <hi>1607.</hi>
