      <hi>I will endevour therefore alwayes, that ye also may be able to have remembrance of these things after my departure.</hi> That time therefore, which others spend, some in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their pleasures, some in ambitious suit of preferment, some in attending their profit, I find most comfort to imploy after this manner: for if that heathen Orator did professe: <hi>that he did bestow as much time in humane studies as others took in following their businesse,</hi>
