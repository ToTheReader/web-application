      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is vsuall with some, that are troubled in their sleepe with sad and melancholy dreames, to striue so strongly with their imagination (that without beeing otherwise moued at all) after they are awakened and come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, remaine so broken and tyred out, as if they had wrestled and tugged hand to hand with some braue fierce Bull. And such a one for all the world doe I finde my selfe in getting out of my former <hi>Proeme,</hi> my mind still beating vpon the Barbarisme, and dis-equall number of those ignorant Dolts, to whose censure I submitted my selfe, it faring therein with me, as with him, who thrusts himselfe into a voluntary exile, hauing not the power afterwards in his owne hands to reuerse his banishment. I did ingage my selfe by promise to compose this booke, and now I am inforced to hold my honest word. I must confesse I made a false Vie, and did set vp my rest in iest, but now I am driuen to see it in earnest. For it is the word, that bindes the Player. I know full well (considering the rudenesse of my wit, and shortnesse of my studies) that it had beene very fit in me to feare the Carreere that I am to make; and that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and licence of mine is more then needed, and might well haue beene spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But considering with my selfe, that there is not any Booke so bad, out of which some good may not be drawne, it may be possible, that in that wherein my wit was wanting, the zeale which I had to profit others, may supply that defect, by working some vertuous effect; which happinesse if I light vpon, it shall bee a sufficient reward of my greater paines, and make this my boldnesse, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>re wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your pardon. I shall not need with the discreet to vse long <hi>Proemes,</hi> nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe circumlocutions. For neither can the eloquence of words vainely worke him, nor the force of speech dotingly perswade him to more then what is iust; nor doth his felicitie consist in the procuring of his fauourable Censure. I remit my selfe to his correction; I craue his helping hand to vphold my weakenesse, and put my selfe wholly vnder his faire protection.</p>
   <p>And thou, (O Reader) that art desirous to profit hereby, if thou wilt but true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider me, when I wrote this Booke, and that common good, to which I had then an eye, thou wilt not conceit, that what hath beene done therein, was haply performed by me for priuate Interest, or vndertaken for ostentation of wit; for I did neuer so much as pretend it, nor could I finde that sufficient worth in me, to put my selfe vpon my wings in so vaine a flight.</p>
   <p>Some perhaps will say, That hauing (like vnto Watermen) turn'd my backe and eyes the contrarie way, (who looke one way, and rowe another) I direct this little Barke of mine, where I haue most desire to land. But vpon mine honest word, hee is deceiued, that so thinketh. For it was my sole purpose, to guide the prow for the publike good, if I might be worthy to obtaine so great a blessing, and that my labour might serue to so good a vse. Thou shalt finde many things not

so cleane wrought, but like Painters first colours, laid on with a carelesse hand and slubberd ouer, which I did omitto polish and flourish ouer for some causes, that gaue hinderance there-vnto. Others are some-what more refined, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shadowed, which I did willingly auoid to follow, and was loth to finish them to the full, being as fearefull, as carefull of committing some vnaduised errour, or vn-conceiued offence. Others I boldly vnmasked and laid open to discouery, as worthy to be drawne without a vayle, and fit to be presented to publike view. I haue much to say vnto thee, and desire so to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>e, yet may not tell it thee. I haue written vnto thee, yet haue I left out much of what I would haue written. Reade so, as it becomes thee to reade, and doe not scoffe at my Fable; and if it shall receiue intertainment at thy hands, accept these lines, which I giue thee, and with them, the minde wherewith they be offered vnto thee. Doe not cast them, as dust and sweepings of the house, vpon the dunghill of obliuion; consider that there may be some filings and parings of price; rake them out, gather them into a heape, and when they come to a conuenient quantitie, put them into the crisole of thy consideration; giue to them the fire of the Spirit; and I assure thee, thou shalt extract some gold from them, wherewithall to inrich thy selfe. These Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are not all of mine owne Quiuer, nor this honey that I set before thee, all of mine owne hiue; much of their sweetnesse did I sucke from holy and learned men; this is merchantable ware, well-conditioned; and for such I recommend it vnto thee. And because there is no goodthing, which doth not proceed from the hands of God; nor any thing so bad, whereof some glory doth not result to his diuine Maiestie (as hauing a part in euery thing) imbrace, and giue a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reception to that which may be profitable for thee, reiecting that which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, or whatsoeuer else is bad, as meerely mine: Albeit I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that those things which cannot hurt, are wont many times to doe much good.</p>
   <p>In this Discourse, thou maist moralize things, as they shall bee offered vnto thee; Thou hast a large margent left thee to doe it; That, which thou shalt find lesse graue, or discomposed, presents it selfe in the person of a <hi>Picaro,</hi> or <hi>Rogue;</hi> which is the Subiect of this Booke. Such things as these (which are not very many) sport thy selfe a while with them, iest &amp; play the wagge, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards shake hands with them. For at great Feasts, we must haue meats for all mouthes; and dishes for all tastes; Pleasant and sweet wines, which must cheere the heart, and helpe digestion; and musicke for to please and delight the eares.</p>
