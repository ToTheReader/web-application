      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing some fiue or sixe yeres since in those partes of Flanders, which are subiect to the Spanish king, and seeing a miserable troupe of my vnhappie countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (some of which were gentlemen of good hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in England,) wandring in poore habites &amp; afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gestures, heauily groning vnder the burthen of an extreeme and calamitous necessitie: on the one side, by their heedlesse demeanure there, debarred from returne into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: and on the other, daily ouerlooked with the proud eyes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull Spaniards, and for want of due regarde in that comfortlesse seruice, perishing without either pity or reliefe. Seeing, as I say, these things and entring into a consideration of them, with an vnpartiall iudgement, knowing some of my good friendes and acquaintance in England, possessed with the like humor, as that which mooued the foresaid gentlemen, to forsake their countrie and to settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the seruice and dominions of the king of Spaine: I thought good to aduertise them of that which my poore experience had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered touching the small regard, distresse, pouertie, scorne, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, &amp; affliction, befallen to such as had alreadie entred the course, that to their vnexperienced iudgement, yealded such shew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: therby, if it were possible, to dissuade them from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like, the same being in regard of the offence to their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne so trecherous; of the reproche to their familye, and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; so infamous, and lastly in so deepe a degree to themselues dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that being once thereinto entered, it should not bee in their power, vpon their afterchange of humor and appetite, thence to withdraw themselues, the error being such as admitteth not any repentaunce or excuse. Hauing to that effect, written from thence priuatly to some of my acquaintaunce, the coppies of my letters (contrarie to my intention) were since my returne, by some of them giuen abrode, and lastly not long since, a discourse printed in Paules Church-yarde, conteining some parte of the substance
<pb facs="3"/>thereof, but manye thinges that I had written left out, and manye thinges inserted that I neuer ment, and finally in the whole so falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and chaunged, aswell in matter as words, &amp; ignorantly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with fictions of the publisher, that howsoeuer the vulgar sorte bee therewith pleased, those that are of farther reach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, cannot but condemne it as a thing fabulous, grossely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and full of absurdities. Besides, the time and occasion to which that discourse was fitting, is now altogether past, and therefore the same altogether impertinent. In regard of which and other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, I thought it not vnfitte to publish the true coppy of my owne letter, which though after so many yeares, cannot but seeme stale, yet the occasions that moued me thereunto considered, I trust I shall not otherwise be censured of, then the sinceritie of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deserueth, which is to dedicate the fruicts of my poore experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the benefit of my countrie, and withall to satisfie the world, as touching the former treatise (for though they are suppressed, yet there are greate numbers of them extant) the which was by a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that had stolne a coppy thereof, foysted to the print, in hope of benefit, and now when the matter comes to examination, slipps his head out of the Coller and will not bee found. Withall, I shall perchaunce, seeing I haue so good an occasion offered, touch by the way some occurrents of later time. And whereas my meaning was at the first, onely to satisfie a few priuate friendes, now seeing it is my chaunce to publish it, I shall entreate the Reader whosoeuer he be, &amp; howsoeuer in religion affected, neuerthelesse laying aside all preiudicate opinion, not to condemne any thing (seeme the same neuer so strange) heerein mencioned, vnlesse hee shall himselfe be able to disprooue it, which I hope, for trewnesse of matter it shal not lie in any mans power to do. For my meaning is not to speak of sophisticall deuices, proiected driftes, or matters forged in the ayre, but plainly and simply, of thinges actually and really doone in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique view of the world, and confirmed with the witnesse of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes.</p>
