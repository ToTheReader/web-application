   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please thee, gentle Reader, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that after we had finished our worke, and that the booke was now ready to come forth, there came to my hands certaine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and amplifications of some points, from the Author himselfe, earnestly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to haue them inserted: which because they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently be brought in in their proper places, the booke being already printed, yet that we might doe him right against the malice of his captious Aduersaries, I thought it good, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow them in this page; requesting thee of thy charity,</hi> which couereth a multitude of sinnes, <hi>at once to pardon both our faults.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Page 30.14. reade <hi>the last Canon,</hi> 45.25. r. <hi>as though he affirmed it without knowledge, and spake it onely vpon trust:</hi> 80.23. r. <hi>iudged to be vniust.</hi> 181.7. r. <hi>the earth is almost full of the chips and pieces thereof.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Page 338.16. after the word <hi>men</hi> leaue out the whole sentence, ending with the word <hi>Saluation;</hi> then adde as followeth. Onely we must note that this word <hi>Dulia</hi> hath a double and doubtfull signification, and that there be two sorts of Dulia; The one is a Religious action; the other is onely a seruice, an humane respect, which is yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also to the liuing. As for that kinde of Dulia, which is a Religious worship, the holy scripture forbiddeth it to be giuen to any saue onely to God alone; as 1. Sam. 7.3. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>Prepare your hearts to the Lord, and yeeld Dulia, or Seruice to him alone.</hi> And <hi>S. Austin;</hi> Quaest. 94. vpon Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

      <hi>debetur Deo tanquam Domino: Doulia is due to</hi> GOD <hi>as to him who is</hi> MASTER. And <hi>de Ciuit. Dei, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Religio non est nisi Dei cultus: Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the seruice of God;</hi> plainly shewing, that the
<pb facs="6"/>seruing of the Creatures is not an action of Religion. But if we take the word <hi>Dulia</hi> for a respect and seruice done vnto men, and not for a religious action: our aduersaries doe amisse to say, that they serue the Saints or other Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with Dulia, seeing they yeeld them a religious seruice and a voluntary worship, tending to the attainment of saluation. Againe <hi>ibid</hi> line 29. reade, <hi>that then no miracles were wrought by their Images.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Page 367.13. r. the whole earth is full of the peeces of it. 399.27. <hi>Modicum quod{que} delictum mora resurrectionis illic luendo.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Page 425.27. r. in the 9. Distinction, and the 9. Canon of the Councell of Antioch, and the 17. Canon of the Councell of Chalcedon. These wordes of the Canon of Antioch, are for a marginall note: <gap reason="foreign">

   <p>Page 433. blot out the 8. last lines, and the first line of the next page.</p>
   <p>Page 440.21. read, So in the 6. generall Councell Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> is condemned as an Hereticke, and cast out of the Catholicke Church in the 13. Act: and the same Councell assembled in the palace, in the 13. Act, doth by name condemne the Church of Rome, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Page 441.17. reade, the 11. Homily of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> vpon Matthew.</p>
   <p>Page 454.14. reade, that Christ is an head more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and greater then the Pope, and that the Pope is of lesse vertue then the holy Ghost.</p>
   <p>Page 470.12. reade, vpon the foundation layd by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Apostle. The fame and good report, and the mutuall communication of the strangers that were Christians with the Romanes, had planted the Christian Religion at Rome; but the Church of Rome required the presence of some Apostle for her full establishment.</p>
