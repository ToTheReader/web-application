To praise Musicke, were to say, the Sunne is bright. To extoll my sefe, would name my labours vaine-glorious. Onely this, my studies are farre from seruile imitations, I rob no others inuentions, I take no Jtali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Note to an English Dittie, or filch fragments of Songs to stuffe out my vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.
