      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, we thinke not our selues dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of the duty we owe to our friend,
when we haue brought the breathles
bodie to the earth: for albeit the eye
there taketh his euer farewell of that
beloued obiect, yet the impression of
the man, that hath been deare vnto vs, liuing an after
life in our memorie, there putteth vs in minde of farther
obsequies due vnto the deceased. And namely of the
performance of whatsoeuer we may iudge shall make to
his liuing credit, and to the effecting of his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
preuented by the stroke of death. By these meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(as by an intellectuall will) I suppose my selfe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
to the vnhappily deceased author of this Poem,
vpon whom knowing that in his life time you bestowed
many kinde fauours, entertaining the parts of reckoning
and worth which you found in him, with good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and liberall affection: I cannot but see so far into
the will of him dead, that what soeuer issue of his braine
<pb facs="3"/>
should chance to come abroad, that the first breath it
should take might be the gentle aire of your liking: for
since his selfe had been accustomed therunto, it would
proue more agreeable and thriuing to his right children,
than any other foster countenance whatsoeuer. At this
time seeing that this vnfinished Tragedy happens vnder
my hands to be imprinted; of a double duty, the one to
your selfe, the other to the diseased, I present the
same to your most fauourable allowance, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my vtmost selfe now and euer to
be readie, at your VVorships
disposing:</p>
