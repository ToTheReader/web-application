   <head>TO MY DEARELY beloved Neighbours, <hi>the Inhabitants of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> of S. <hi>Nic. Col. Abby</hi> in Old Fishstreet, LONDON.</head>
   <p>ALL divine truths and duties are therefore worthy to be knowne, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by men, because they have beene worthy to bee revealed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>mman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God: But of them all, the heavenly truthes of Gods service, and Mans salvation; &amp; the holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of seeking after both, are most worthy of their
<pb facs="3"/>knowledge and practise.</p>
   <p>For if those things be chiefly to be sought after, that are best wo thy of our seeking: If those things be best worthy of our see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that doe most neerely concerne us. And if Gods service and Mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doe most neerely concerne us; because the one most neerely concernes our dutie to God, and the other our happinesse from God: then ought Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians chiefly to seeke after Gods service, and their owne salvation.</p>
   <p>The rather: Partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all other Divinitie doth but serve to further
<pb facs="3"/>Christians in seeking after these two: and partly also, because all other without these, will never make them wise with that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<note place="margin">Psal: 111.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>0 2 Tim: 3 15.</note>
      <hi>The beginning whereof is Gods feare,</hi> and the end their owne <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Vpon these and the like grounds, (my dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved people and Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) I have endeavoured to instruct you in these two points, and what I have taught you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them in my Sermons, I have now put into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke, with some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to the end, your eyes by reading, as well as
<pb facs="4"/>your eares by preaching, may witnesse how unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly <hi>I desire</hi> you should serve God,
<note place="margin">Rom: 10.1.</note> and he <hi>saved.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The booke is but little, (it is the fitter to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your pockets, &amp; kept in your memories.) And it is framed in a Dialogue, or familiar conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my selfe and one of you, hoping to drawe you, better to like of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein contained, by my friendlie manner of handling it.</p>
   <p>Though the Dialogue and conference be betwixt but one of you and my selfe: yet is it in the name and for the benefit of you
<pb facs="4"/>all; upon whom it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed for a <hi>New-yeares gift</hi> by him, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed himselfe upon you these many yeares,
<note place="margin">2 Cor: 12.15.</note> &amp; who will yet hee <hi>spent upon you</hi> (to Gods pleasure) for the furthering of you in the service of God unto your salvation.</p>
   <p>What remaines, but that as I have made my labors yours, by publishing them for you, and dedicating them unto you; so you would endeavour to make them your owne, by peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, and labouring to benefit your selves and families, by reading them together, by conference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="5"/>them, and prayer to God for his blessing upon them to your edification.</p>
   <p>I have heretofore made and published other bookes (besides this) for your learning: but how you have used and perused them to this end, is better known to God, your selves and Housholds, than unto me. If you have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to build up your selves in grace by them, I shall be glad to see the fruites thereof: But if you have only contented your selves with this, that they were made for you, given unto you, and that you have them lying on your shelves
<pb facs="5"/>or in your chests, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to heare of your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment in using this booke better;
<note place="margin">Ios. 14.15.</note> if now <hi>you and your houshold</hi> will seeke to <hi>serve the Lord,</hi> and to be saved.</p>
   <p>You shall doe this the better, if you will observe these Directions.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> I would have you to reade it often, because the subject matter of it, is of such necessary, ordinary, and excellent use.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> I would have you (as you reade it) to examine &amp; consider, how you have knowne the truthes, and practised the duties taught therein, concerning Gods
<pb facs="6"/>service, and mans salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that so you may see cause, either to repent of your ignorance, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence herein for time past; or to grow in your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those points in time to come.</p>
   <p n="3">3. I would have you to call to minde, and use, the severall duties that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Gods Attributes of greatnesse, or goodnesse, or to Gods workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or justice, as by Gods providence they shall come into your thoughts, or fall out in the world: and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that (before you goe to any holy Ordinance of
<pb facs="6"/>God, appointed for his publike service) you would looke into this booke for the particular duties which belong unto them several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; to the end you may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse your selves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme those Ordinances, with those duties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. The like direction I give for the reading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my booke of the Lords Supper, before you goe to the Communion. And this is the greatest recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that I will require of you for my love, and it is the least requitall you can make me for my labour.

      <hi>The good Lord</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and encourage <hi>every
<pb facs="7"/>one</hi> of you, to <hi>set your hearts to seeke God, the Lord God of your fathers,</hi> (that is) to seeke to serve God, while you live on earth; that when you dye, you may be saved in heaven by Iesus Christ: in whom I am</p>
