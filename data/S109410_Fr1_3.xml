   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, it is possible that you would maruel that I should write this booke called the <hi>Art of shooting in great Ordnance</hi> for two great causes: the one is this, first for that I haue not seene (to most peoples iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) so great experience in these affayres, whereby you may thinke that I haue not knowledge sufficient to be a teacher in these matters. And the second cause is this: for that my order of teaching is contrary vnto all that haue taken vpon them to be teachers, or instructers in these matters or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires before time. Therefore for to shew vnto you the cause that hath moued me to write this rude volūe, is this, for that we Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men haue not beene counted but of late daies to become good Gunners, and the principall point that hath caused English men to be counted good Gunners, hath been, for that they are hardie or without fear about their ordnance: but for the knowledg in it, other nations and countries haue tasted better therof, as the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, French and Spaniardes, for that English men haue had but little instructions but that they haue learned of the Doutchmen or Flemings in the time of King Henry the eight. And the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cause that English men are thought to be good Gunners, is this: for that they are handsome about their Ordnance in ships, on the Sea, &amp;c. And furthermore, I doe thinke it good to shewe vnto you three great causes besides diuers other small causes, that the thing that hath letted or hindred English men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cunning in the shooting of great Ordinance, although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers prooues haue beene made at sundrie times, and Ordnance hath beene had into the fielde, both in maister Bromefields time whē that he was Liefetenāt of the Ordnance, &amp; at diuers times since, and yet those prooues that haue beene made then were no proofes, but to cause those Gunners that did see the experience of those profes, to committe a further errour as touching the shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="4"/>
in great Ordnance, and the reason therof is this: the first &amp; principal cause is, that they did make their proofe with a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, and so it ought to be, that is to say, the fourth parte of a Circle deuided into 90. equall partes, which some simple Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will call a Triangle, but there is no instrument so called, but onely a Quadrant: and the original of the making thereof is the fourth part of a Circle deuided into 90. equall partes, what forme so euer that it hath. And now the principal vse of the quadrant, is to know what any peece will cast at the mount of euerie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and so from degree vnto degree, vnto the best of the Rander. And the cause that hath made the Gunners to commit error by the mounting of the peeces by the degree of the Quadrant, hath beene this, although that it be true that such a peece will cast the shot so many scores at the mount of so many degrees, and yet whē that they haue made proofe therof, they haue foūd it meere false, &amp; yet the thing most true, although somtime the shot hath flien a great deale further, and sometime much shorter, which causes were no other thing but the highnes or the lownes of the ground, for that there is seldome any ground that you shall find leuell, but it will be higher or lower then the ground that the peece standeth vpon, as I doe more at large declare in the thirtenth chapter of the booke, and yet in the time of seruice there is no vsing of the Quadrant but in some cases, and then take a great large one, for in a small you may soone commit errour. And furthermore I doe know diuers that will haue instruments, and yet be vtterlie voide of the vses of them, for it is the reason of the person in the doing of any thing, and not the instrumentes, for in the doing of any thing, if the person doth not consider of all thinges with him and against him, he or they be apt to commit errour, &amp;c. The second great cause is this, in the vsing to giue leuell with a rule set out in inche partes: but vnto this they cannot order it, nor giue it no Method to know what any peece wil doe at any number of inches aduantage, for the peeces doe differ in casting, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their lengths, as I doe further shew in the booke. Wherefore the vse of the inche rule according as they doe vse it, is to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="4"/>
purpose, but onely to seeke out what numbers of inches will reach the marke, and that being knowne, then to keepe the length of the marke with that peece. And the necessariest thing that this kind of giuing of leuell in the time of seruice (as being in a Castell, Forte, or Towne, or such like, the Gunner hauing charge of any peece,) is to beate al those markes that be apte to doe any seruice at, and to know how manie inches will reach any marke, &amp;c. but to become a cunning Gunner, he shall neuer be, although he should shoote 100. shottes euerie day through a yeere, for that he neuer doth know by that meanes the distance of any marke, but in euerie peece he must make a new proofe, if that the peece be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or chaunged from that place. Wherefore I haue made a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, shewing how many inches, and what part of an inch will make a degree, and so vnto ten degrees whereby you may make a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode to hit the length of the marke in anie peece at the first shot, as it doth appeare in the eight chapter of the booke, if so be that there were a true and exact table of proportion, of the casting of the peece at the mount of euerie degree, but I haue not had so greate proofe but that I may bee deceiued, for I haue no other proofe but at my owne charges, and my abilitie is able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make any proofe in those causes. The third great cause is this, I do know few Gunners, yea none at all in respect, that hath anie capacitie, to know the distance vnto anie marke assigned if that the marke be such that they can not come vnto it directly by land, and yet there be verie true and exact wayes to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance vnto anie marke assigned, howsoeuer the thing is, if that it may be seene by Geometrie perspectiue: and the lacke therof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Gunners is the principallest point that doth deceiue thē, so that these three things doe vtterly deceiue most men: the first is this, the height or lownes of the ground: the second the length of the peece: and the third not knowing the distance vnto the marke: for their reason in these causes that they doe suppose, can doe nothing, that is to say, to finde the distance vnto anie marke assigned, by looking vpon the ground, and that neuer can shew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the distance vnto the marke but yet must be knowen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="5"/>
by the Scale or crosse staffe, or else it must be knowen by the lines of Position, which is shewed in a booke of mine that is extant in Print, called the <hi>Treasure for Trauelers,</hi> and also in a booke set forth by master <hi>Thomas Digges</hi> called <hi>Pantometria,</hi> wher in those two bookes you shall finde meanes and waies both how to finde the true distance vnto the marke, and also how much that the marke is hier ground or lower ground, then the place that you are vpon, and also the length of the line Hipothenusall, whether it bee vppe the hill or downe the hill, which is verie neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and profitable for all them that will vse to shoote in great Ordnance, for to know, as all Gunners, Captaines, and Leaders of men, &amp;c. And now friendly Reader, it is possible that some people will dislike of me, for that I haue written this booke: some of them for that they doe thinke that they haue better knowledge in those matters then I, and other some perhaps may be offended, for that they would not haue the thing knowen but amongst thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and othersome possible will be offended with me that are Gunners, that are altogether without any knowledg in those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that wold not haue their ignorāce knowen. So by these meanes I am assured that I shal purchase a great number of enemies, as I do know that I haue alreadie caused sundry people to enuie me, as some Sea men do mislike of me for writing of my booke called <hi>the Regiment for the Sea,</hi> and othersome of late are offended with me for the writing and setting forth of my booke called <hi>the Treasure for Trauelers,</hi> but notwithstanding, I doe see that it is needfull to be knowen vnto a number of them that be Gunners, waying and considering with my selfe what a number there bee, that will take vpon them to be Gunners, yea and that maister Gunners, that are not sufficient nor capable in those causes, but are in respect altogether ignorant, standing vpon no other thing but their antiquitie, that they haue serued as Gunners so long time. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> doe thinke it very necessarie for them to haue some good instructions: but as farre as I can see, euerie man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth curtesie to doe the common wealth of our Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande any good therein, and as far as I can perceiue that no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="5"/>
may better pleasure the common wealth in the time of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, either by Sea or Land, then may good Gunners against the face of our enimies: for the Realme of England hath a great number of enimies: for as we haue seene by daily experience, that the Queenes progenitours aforetime were neuer long without warres, yet we haue a most gratious and louing Prince raigning ouer vs, which doth alw aies studie for peace and tranquillitie: God graunt of his mercie that she may liue long and raigne ouer vs. Amen. Yet nothwithstanding, it is good for vs to studie in the time of peace, how to defend our selues in the time of warres &amp; troubles, as generally we prouide in haruest for to liue in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for that cause haue I written this little treatise, not to the intent to teach thē that be cūning, but to giue instructiōs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thē that be of the simplest sorte, &amp;c. Wherfore (Gentle Reader) beare with my rudenes, for that I am so bold to be the first Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man that put foorth any booke as touching these causes, and it is possible that there be a number would looke that I shoulde haue giuen them place, for that they are more worthy and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller in these causes, thinking that I am to simple, for they doe not consider how that God doth giue his giftes, as we see daily he giueth vnto one man riches, and another man pouertie, and one man to be a ruler, and an other to be inferior, one man wise &amp; prudent, and an other ignorant, one man beautifull, and an other deformed, one mā of a tall stature, &amp; an other of a low stature, one man strong and lustie, and an other weake &amp; lame: although that they be of one consanguinitie, linitie or kindred, such is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous workes of God. Wherefore men are not to be measured by elles, but vy vertue, for God is not partiall in his giftes, for hee hath shed his most precious blood for the redemption of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, so that afore him all are one, for we are all his creatures and the sheepe of his pasture, and the workes of his handes, so he is our God, and we are his people, so that we keepe his holy will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, but flesh and blood is so fraile, that we can doe no good of our selues, for God worketh the will and deed in all his creatures, for by his holy spirit he doth giue sundry gifts &amp; al for
<pb facs="6"/>
the profite both of our soules &amp; bodies, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to one is giuen through the spirite the vtterance of wisedome, to an other the vtterance of knowledge, by that same spirite to an other faith, by that same spirite to another the gifte of healing, by that same spirite to another professing, to an other iudgmēt to discerne spirits, to another diuers tongues, to an other the interpretations of tongues, and al those doth the spirite of God worke and distribute vnto euery man according vnto his most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will and pleasure. Then what a vaine generation of people be we to striue against the wil &amp; pleasure of God, as who should say that God is bound to be ruled by the wil and pleasure of man. But what speciall gifte soeuer God doth giue vnto man, let them giue him thanks therfore, and looke that they doe not abuse the same gift, for if that they doe, it will be a snare to take them in, and so be an example vnto the whole world. For as soone as our heart is lifted vp with vanities, then entreth the Diuel, &amp; he causeth a man to fall and decline from God, thinking with our selues, that the gift that God hath giuen vnto vs commeth of our selues. For as some do think that haue riches, that they haue it by their own industry, and some doing diuers other thinges, thinke that it commeth of themselues, with diuers other speciall gifts that god giueth vnto man, therefore whensoeuer God doth giue any speciall gift to any person, then let him giue him thankes therfore, vsing it to the lawd, praise, glorie, and honor of God, &amp; to the profite of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the common wealth of his Natiue countrie, for great is the wickednes of the people vpon the face of the earth, as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this in these our dayes, that the Bishop of Rome with all his adherents, doth daily practise how and by what meanes to bring this our noble realme of England to vtter confusion, therfore it is very meete and necessarie for vs to deuise how to preuent them, and then there is no doubt if that we doe our good will and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but the liuing God wil deliuer vs from the hands and snares of such wicked Antichristes, that do seeke the blood of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an seruants of God. Wherfore it is very meet for vs that be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Christians and true subiectes to our prince and Countrie, to
<pb facs="6"/>
arme our selues first with faith, secondly with manly courage, and thirdly with armor for our back, for let vs be assured without Gods mightie prouidence vnto the contrarie, that as soone as they haue vs at any aduantage, that then let vs looke for no other matter, but that they will giue the attempt, for such is the wickednes of the malicious Papists, yea euē some of them are those that should or ought to be good subiects vnto their Prince and natiue coūtry. Wherfore I beseech the liuing God to cōfound such wicked Impes that should seeke the destruction of their Prince, and especially a vertuous, mercifull, and a godly Prince, and secondly the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their natiue Realme and countrie, yea euen the nurce to them and their forefathers that hath yeelded vnto them all kind of foode and necessaries. What greater wickednes can there be in men? and they themselues are bound by the lawes of God and also by the lawes of nature, to defend their Prince and Countrie: for we nor they haue no iust quarell to fight by the lawes of God, but onely to defend our Prince and countrie and the liberties therof. Therefore it is meet for vs to cal vnto God for mercie and grace, and then there is no doubt but that he wil deliuer vs, &amp; turne all their wicked deuises vnto their own destruction, euen as thē that make a pitte for other and fall into it themselues. Wherefore it is meet for al them that are Noble men and Magistrates, &amp; such as are in authoritie, to cherish and maintayne al those that are good and vertuous subiectes and good members in the common wealth, and contrariwise, it is very necessary and conuenient to punish all wicked doers, and such as doe annoy and hurt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, hauing no regard, neither for loue nor fauour, nor hatred or malice, neither for bribes nor friends, but to rewarde euery man according vnto their desertes: for as it is sin to suffer vice vnpunished, so in like manner it is as euill to see Vertue not revvarded, cherished nor mainteyned.</p>
