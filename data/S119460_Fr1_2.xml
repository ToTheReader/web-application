      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onorable Mistris in the waine of my litle wit, I am forst to desire your protection, else euery Ballad-singer will proclaime me bankrupt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. A sortof mad fellows seeing me merrily dispos'd in a Morrice, haue so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted mee in print since my gambols began from London to Norwich, that (hauing but an ill face before) I shall appeare to the world without a face, if your fayre hand wipe not away their foule coulors. One hath written <hi>Kempsfarewell</hi> to the tune of Kery, mery, Buffe: another his despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate daungers in his late trauaile: the third his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement to New-Market; which towne I came neuer neere by the length of halfe the heath. Some sweare in a Trenchmore I haue trode a good way to winne the world: others that guesse righter, affirme, I haue without good help daunst my selfe out of the world: many say many thinges
<pb facs="3"/> that were neuer thought. But in a word your poore seruant offers the truth of his progresse and profit to your honorable view, receiue it I beseech you, such as it is, rude and plaine, for I know your pure iudgement, lookes as soone to see beauty in a Blackamoore, or heare smooth speech from a Stammerer, as to finde any thing, but blunt mirth in a Morrice dauncer, especially such a one as <hi>Will Kemp,</hi> that hath spent his life in mad ligges and merry iestes. Three reasons mooue mee to make publik this iourney, one to reproue lying fooles I neuer knew: the other to cōmend louing friends, which by the way I daily found: the third to shew my duety to your honorable selfe, whose fauours (among other bountifull friends) makes me (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of this sad world) iudge my hart Corke, &amp; my heeles feathers, so that me thinkes I could flye to Rome (at least hop to Rome, as the olde Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbis) with a morter on my head: In which light conceite I lowly begge pardon and leaue, for my Tabrer strikes his huntsup, I must to Norvvich: I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine Noble Mistris, I am now setting from my Lord Mayors, the houre about seauen, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gloomy, the company many, my hart merry.</p>
