   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Loyall Duty may be counted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption?
then doubtlesse the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t
of my meanest worth must begge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for claiming so Royall a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
Yet to whom should I prostrate my Pen
<pb facs="7"/>
and Pilgrimage? if not unto your Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:
Nay, none so able to Receive it, none
so powerfull to Protect it; and none so justly
to claime it, as your Soveraigne Selfe. The
subject treateth of my tedious and curious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes,
in the best and worst parts of the world;
which being begunne in Your hopefull <hi>Infancy,</hi>
are now finally accomplished in the fulnesse of
Your thrice blessed <hi>Majority.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The generall Discourse it selfe, is most fixed
upon the <hi>Lawes, Religion, Manners, Policies, and
Gouernment of Kings, Kingdomes, People, Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Powers;</hi> and therefore so much the
more sit for your <hi>Majesty.</hi> The defect resting
onely in me, the worthlesse Author, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
rare and plentifull Subject, with a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and familiar Stile; no wayes fit for Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to peruse.</p>
   <p>Yet (<hi>Royall Sir</hi>) vouchsafe to remember how
thankefully <hi>Alexander</hi> received a small Cup
of water; and what a high Value was set upon
the <hi>Widowes Mite.</hi> If I have made vse of my
poore Talent, the profit redoundeth unto my
Country; which being shadowed vnder your
auspicuous Fauour, shall leaue a greater stampe
to the worke, and a deeper impression, of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-knowledge,
to the curious <hi>Vnderstanders.</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
And how often wont your ever blessed Father,
graciously to peruse Lines of mine, of far lesser
note then these be: Yea, and (<hi>viva voce</hi>) the
punctuall Discourse of all my three voyages,
which are now layd open to the Vulgar world;
and therefore I dare humbly expect a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for a larger and more serious Taske.</p>
   <p>So likewise your owne Princely adventures
beyond Seas, in measuring large Kingdoms, &amp;
the glassie face of the great Ocean: have invited
me to lay prostrate my painefull peregrinations
at your Sacred feete. Humbly beseeching your
Regall goodnesse, to remarke the matter and
manner of this Worke; howsoever the Gift, &amp;
the Giver be deficient. And questionlesse as
the Bee, gathereth sweetest Hony out of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<hi>Flowers,</hi> your Royall vnderstanding may
finde something, to underprop the Defects of
my nothing; and my soule to exult in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
sparke of your <hi>Gracious Clemency.</hi> And lastly,
the grievous <hi>Sufferings, tortures,</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
in <hi>Malaga,</hi> being taken as a Spye for your
Late <hi>Fathers</hi> Fleete, exposed against <hi>Algier:</hi> and
condemned to death by their bloody <hi>Inquisition</hi>
for the <hi>Gospells</hi> sake. These (I prostrate say) doe
commaund me to present the perfect passage
thereof, vnto your Royall &amp; Religious consrde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb facs="8"/>
Sufficient Certificates, and infallible approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are annexed to the Tragicall discourse it
selfe; and it also humbly bequeathing all, unto
your Princely Piety and Pitty, to commiserate
both my case and cause. Wherefore (and as
duty bindeth) I shall ever beseech God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your Royall Raigne from wicked <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phells,</hi>
to guard your Sacred person with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Angels,</hi> and to guid your Monarchicke
State, with faithful and Religious Counsellors.</p>
