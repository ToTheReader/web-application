   <p>A wise and rationall Historian comparing and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
diuers Common-wealths, why one subsisted,
and others decayed; and how the one preuailed vpon
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
the other; examined the formes and institutions, their
designes, and ends, and what was possible to be built
vpon them. That of <hi>Plato</hi> he esteemed vncapable of
comparison, other then as a Statue to a man, which
had excellent art, without life. <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes</hi> were
not vnderlaid to beare any aduersitie: But when they
were most like to rise, the temperature of their policy
was insufficient to allay the abundance and increase
of humours, &amp; the growth was too sudden and heauy
for the foundation: when they began to shake, their
root had no earth. The <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> to subsist of it

<hi>Caeterùm ad parandum sibi in vicinos dominatum,</hi>
to extend their Empire, euen their owne foundation
was an impediment. A blessed state, if Ambition were
banished the world; but defectiue to absolute safetie:
For no defence is secure, that cannot offend. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as soone as that State began to affect conquest,
and to raise Armies, they found in their constitution,
that the Lawes made to keepe them happy,<note place="margin">Plat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> were too
narrow to hold others in seruitude: and their vntried
felicitie blinded their iudgement, to ouer-value their
owne abilities. <hi>Qui vitam instituisset contra naturam,
meritò etiam contra naturam fato functus est.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Polib.</note>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Carthagenians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had larger ends, &amp;
a broader foundation, like abilities and aptitudes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them, which were <hi>Imperium mundi.</hi> And though
all Common-wealths doe <hi>conuenire in aliquo medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi>
yet they which designe quiet possession of their owne,
and vsurpation of the Estates of others, are at both
ends vtterly repuguant.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="3" facs="3"/>
The reasons why the <hi>Romans</hi> preuailed vpon <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
      <note place="margin">Polib.</note>
being alike instituted, are another consideration,
the manner of building, the constancy, vertue, and
goodnesse of Instruments are great differences. In
these the <hi>Romans</hi> excelled▪ and perhaps in the
youth (for euery <hi>State</hi> hath an Infancy, a mature, and
a decrepitage) and consequently soonest arriued at
their ends. But that wherein most effectually they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,
was in Counsels; in which they had aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in the forme of their gouernment: For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Carthage,</hi> in all deliberations, had too much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
which bred delay, and hindered secrecy;
whereas in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Optimati,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and wise men, onely resolued. <hi>Imus ad bellum,
non omnes Nuncios palam audiri,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Polib.</note>
      <hi>non omnia consilia
cunctis praesentibus tractari, ratio rerum, aut occasionum
velocitas patitur. Victoria consilijs, &amp; ratione perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>From these Considerations a Consequence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that when any two great Kingdomes fall into
a warre, that which will preuaile, must consider the
ends of the other, and the wayes and meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are prosecuted, and to them must apply all
industry, and direct opposition. In the ends, as there
is great difference, so there is great aduantage by thē:
because actiue things, <hi>etiamsi agendo repatiantur,</hi>
weare-out passiue, though of equall strength and
hardnesse, as the iron that strikes, in time batters that
which suffers. <hi>Common-wealths</hi> that designe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and are alway attentiue to watch occasion,
get ground vpon the modest, more by vigilancy then
force: and fraud, which is a terrible instrument, doth
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
euer accompany Ambition. Counsels vanquish
Armes, as spirituall things are predominant vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,
and as fire dissolues the fastest metals: &amp; those
Counsels are most preualent, which are vnited in one
head, and issue from one fountaine.</p>
   <p>Therefore rising and encreasing Empires are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
if they once grow great, and must be resisted
in their ends, and in their counsels: single defence is
not sufficient: troublesome neighbours must be made
passiue, to abate their reputation, which the spirit of
action presupposeth.</p>
   <p>To apply these premisses, hauing read with pleasure
the following Discourse of the Reasons of the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in the <hi>Valteline;</hi> and being at leasure, eyther
to sleep, or wast in mine owne meditations, I thought
it would be a good recreation, and not vnacceptable
to my loyall Countrimen, to teach it to speake as
plaine <hi>English,</hi> as it doth truth; and finding the whole
scope of the Author (an Authour of great worth, and
greater works) to be an information to the World,
of the dangerous encrease, and ambition of the house
of <hi>Austria:</hi> and, if possible, to read the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi>
a lesson, not to bee learned, but vnder a Rodd of Iron,
<hi>that in time necessity would open the eyes of all Princes,
to oppose his secret proiect of Vniuersall Monarchy;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
that some profit might be gathered out of this
forraine Garden.</p>
   <p>I wil suppose that this Theame is sufficiently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and that there are few practised in the world, who
will deny it. The witnesses are great and euident; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
vniustly vsurped; <hi>Sicily</hi> surprised by treason; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>

to iudge either competently, or as Arbiter, the
pretences of <hi>Parma &amp; Braganza,</hi> when it was possible
in temporall Causes, his spirit might erre in not ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Spaine:</hi> The <hi>Valteline</hi> possessed vnder the colour
of <hi>Religion; The Palatinate</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Cleue</hi>
seised by <hi>auxiliars,</hi> and kept for Debts forced vpon
the Proprietaries, which they desired not to borrow:
<hi>Wesell</hi> stollen in a truce; and the <hi>Rhyne</hi> passed ouer
vnder the fauour of a Treaty; <hi>Embden</hi> attempted;
<hi>Venice</hi> conspired; <hi>Piemont</hi> assaulted; <hi>France</hi> twice cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
into Combustion, with holy leagues and
open Armes: and <hi>England</hi> practiced, and inuaded;
And to bee able to doe any, or all these, a scelerous
peace sought with the <hi>Turke,</hi> to whom, in truth,
<hi>Spaine</hi> is only a true friend. These are such a Cloud of
witnesses, as no modesty will oppugne them.</p>
   <p>Which being now manifest to the world, and that
it is expected euery wise Prince and <hi>State</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<hi>nunc meares agitur,</hi> I also haue presumed to
warne <hi>diuisos ab orbe Britannos;</hi> who being separated
from Generall Commerce by the Sea, which is our
wall, true Information may bee kept out, as well as
Enemes.</p>
   <p>To which purpose, without any malignity or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
offence, I must looke one age back; For in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Alas, the Kings of <hi>Castile</hi> were good Neighbors,
and were content not to bee supplanted by their
owne Moores, mingled with their Subiects, both in
house and bloud.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="6" facs="5"/>
      <hi>England</hi> hath been the speciall and most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
marke at which this new <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath aymed,
since <hi>cupido dominandi</hi> outgrew Conscience, and all
lawes of Iustice; <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Queene</hi> of the Sea, and
<hi>Lady</hi> of Traffique being conquered, halfe of the
whole is done. <hi>England</hi> hath more hindered this
vnnaturall growth, then all <hi>Europe;</hi> it is then out of
question, that the wisedome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which neuer
erreth in the way of greatnesse, loues and hates no
kingdome so much, as <hi>England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>When <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> had wonne the famous
battaile of <hi>Lepanto,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Raphael Pereg.</note> and therein laid to himselfe a
foundation of advancement, and had gotten possession
of the Citty of <hi>Tunis;</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Councell, foreseeing
the rising <hi>Starre</hi> of a new <hi>Monarchy,</hi> though in their
owne Princes bloud, rather resolued to rase, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that Towne; and accordingly gaue order to the
<hi>Generall.</hi> But hee, who had higher thoughts, fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and sollicited the <hi>Pope Pius quintus,</hi> to intercede
with the <hi>Catholique</hi> king, that the Title of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
might bee conferred vpon him, to erect a fresh
<hi>opposite</hi> to the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> The king of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
iealous of any Concurrent, vtterly refused this honor
to his owne Brother: and suddenly, to exercise his
great mind vpon some subiect of his priuat seruice,
sent him <hi>Gouernour</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where hee was as
like to breake, as rise; The young Prince, whose
fathers bloud boiled in his veynes, discontent to bee
shut vp in so narrow a Compasse, fell vpon a new
practise, to conquer <hi>England,</hi> and procured so farre
with the same Pope, that he dealt earnestly with the
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>
Catholique King, to consent to that Enterprise, and
to contribute Aydes for the Execution, in fauour
whereof his <hi>Holiness</hi> had already granted him <hi>Bulls,
Breues, Money,</hi> and the <hi>secret Inuestiture,</hi> though this
Proiect in the manner was not acceptable to King
<hi>Phillip,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> should giue that away, without
first consulting with him, which hee had embraced in
his owne thoughts, yet he yeelded and promised to
assist <hi>Don Iohn</hi> in the Inuasion of <hi>England;</hi> So much
more hee thirsted to depriue a <hi>Christian Prince</hi> of an
antient Inheritance, then to keepe a great Kingdom,
opportunely seated to annoy the <hi>Turks,</hi> from his
friends, the <hi>Ottomans;</hi> I will not Physically conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
what bloud begat this Counsell; but propose
it, as a worthy and great Consideration.</p>
   <p>The attempt of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Medina,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
<hi>Armado,</hi> was a fruit of the same root; But
that the sword might not seeme to cut through all
Iustice, to corrupt the minds of the ignorant, and to
satisfie the doubtfull and scrupulous, a counterfeit
booke;<note place="margin">Dolman.</note> vnder a counterfeit name, was published, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing

giue euery one their owne right, it cunningly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
that the reasons of the <hi>Infanta Isabella</hi> were
more pregnant then all the rest, which could not
come into question vntill Sixteene Princes successori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

   <p>It is one of the Vaine-glories of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that they
hold no correspondence, nor euer made any peace
with the great Enemy of <hi>Christendome,</hi> calumniating
and reproaching all other Princes and States, who, for

of all Princes. And such a Peace and opportunitie the

<hi>Turky:</hi> And if this be not sufficient, to returne the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie
cast vpon others; Let it be weighed vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it shall appeare, that all the correspondence
and trade of all the Princes in amity with the <hi>Grand

in continuall feare, or warre. Wherby that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemie liues in safety, and at ease, watching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages
vpon all, indifferently.</p>
   <p>About the time that <hi>Phillip</hi> the second (the holy
League to depriue <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of the <hi>Crowne</hi> of

pretending occasion to send another of his Tribe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Iehuda Serfati,</hi> vpon priuate affaires (but practised
by the Ministers of <hi>Spaine</hi>) into that Country; as soon
as he arriued at the frontire, by the Kings order he was
created an Ambassador from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and
conducted in that qualitie to the Court, and a Counsel
held, in what manner to giue him audience; His name
was already changed to <hi>Don Gabriell di Bona-Ventura,</hi>
      <pb n="10" facs="7"/>
his Instructions drawne by a <hi>Iunto</hi> for the purpose; and
thus hee was shewed abroad, defrayed by the King,
and his Message published, that hee was imployed to
offer Peace and friendship from the <hi>Turkish Emperour.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>When this Scene was acted, he was sent backe with
true Letters of <hi>Don Christofero di Mora,</hi> and the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

signed by the King <hi>Yoel Rey.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Passing by <hi>Sicily,</hi> by Catholique Order, Forty Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Slaues were deliuered him, to present at the Port,

   <p>With which Orders and Armes being arriued at

   <p>But this practise being discouered by the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors

<hi>Don Gabriel</hi> by the great <hi>Vizier</hi> was clapt in prison, as
a Counterfeit and Impostor.</p>
   <p>In a few moneths this <hi>Vizier</hi> was displaced, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
aduanced to his Office, and, as it is a common
rule with them, to runne a contrary course to their
fallen Predecessors, without examining the merits or
causes: this <hi>Iew</hi> was set at libertie, and all his actions
and Letters approued, as true and authenticall; And
<pb n="11" facs="7"/>
thereupon Petition made to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the Negotiation; and by the counsell of the
new Ministers, it was admitted, and accepted, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
granted to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that seeing hee had
shewed so much affection to peace, and to enter into
a sincere Correspondence with the Port, especially by
the charitable liberty of so many <hi>Mahometans</hi> freely
presented; that the Gates of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> were
alway open to whomsoeuer did seeke their friendship:
and that Ambassadors might securely come to treat
and conclude it.</p>
   <p>With these Letters to the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to <hi>Don Christofero di Mora,</hi> and the <hi>Secretary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagna</hi>
from the <hi>Vizier, Don Gabriel</hi> was dispeeded
with two Messengers of the Port, by the way of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia</hi>
to the confines of the <hi>Empire,</hi> purposing to take
his iourney through <hi>Germany.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But <hi>Rodolphus</hi> being then in warre with <hi>Sultan Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet,</hi>
he was stayed, and examined on the Borders;
To free himselfe, he fained that he had Letters to the
<hi>Emperour;</hi> whereupon all his papers were seized, and
sent to <hi>Prague.</hi> His <hi>Imperiall Maiesty</hi> very discontent,
and iealous of such Treaties betweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
without his communication, and in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncture;
gaue order, that the <hi>Iew</hi> should be brought
to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and kept in close Prison, vntill he had some
advice from <hi>Madrid.</hi> The <hi>Catholique</hi> King, finding
<hi>diu non latêre scelera,</hi> to saue the honor of his priuate
Designes, denyed the fact, forsooke and protested the
poore <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who miserably there ended his
life, <hi>conassai mala-ventura.</hi> It may be collected, that
the Spanish ends of this Treaty were such as durst not
<pb n="12" facs="8"/>
abide the light, seeing they might not bee trusted to
the nearest friend; and it was iudged great modesty,
to be ashamed, and the part of a good <hi>Christian,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
secret practises with <hi>Turkes,</hi> by the mediation
of <hi>Iewes,</hi> but of an ill Master, to leaue and abandon his
Seruant. Such Vessels in the hands of Princes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for honor, or dishonor, as their interests counsell
them.</p>
   <p>In later times, the extraordinary Ambassadors of
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> treating at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the frontire
Affaires, and accidentall Breaches, another ouerture
was by them made in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
and the best argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sed was, that the world knew
but two great and <hi>Imperiall</hi> Families, <hi>Austria,</hi> and <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman,</hi>
who if they were reconciled, might make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diuision of <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West:</hi> The rest, it is more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
to conceale, then Christianitie to negotiate.</p>
   <p>This last yeare a <hi>Bolognese</hi> was sent from the Vice-King
of <hi>Naples,</hi> in pursuit of the same Designe; and
counterfeit Letters printed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> with a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of impossible presents, pretended from the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to beg peace, and spread abroad, to add
reputation to his Armies; as if the world would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at a smoake: And though this Engine returned
fruitlesse, yet <hi>Spaine</hi> is not hopelesse. They know the
ease and aduantage they should draw, by securitie on
this side, to haue all their Gallies at libertie, to shut vp
the <hi>Straights,</hi> to hinder traffique, and to succour <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua;</hi>
and their Garrisons of <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Sicily free,</hi>
to be imployed in their other necessities. And here it
cannot be ouer-passed, that while <hi>Spaine</hi> did negotiate
this Peace, doubting not to effect it, the same instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="13" facs="8"/>
were imployed with monies and Letters, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the <hi>Cossacques</hi> (though in preiudice of the Peace
of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> allyed to the House of <hi>Austria</hi>
by a double mariage) to inuade the <hi>Bospherus,</hi> that the
Armado of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> might necessarily be
kept in the blacke-Sea, for defence, whereby the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> by a fine Art, doth enioy halfe the fruits of
the Peace, without obtaining it: These are a modell
of the wayes and counsels of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> enuied his Brother the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of a <hi>Mahometan</hi> kingdome; and treat vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

of the <hi>Emperour;</hi> If he sollicit the seeds of a warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> vnder the colour
of a peace, without care of the vtilitie of that Crowne
so neerly to him allyed: It may be concluded, that
<hi>ambition of vniuersall Monarchy, is onely able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
all obligations, both of Religion and blood:</hi> Because,
<hi>Si violandum jus est,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eurip.</note>
      <hi>imperijgratia violandum est, alijs

   </p>
   <p>If the first step to this sole Empire be the Conquest
of <hi>England,</hi> as the Designes of the Enemy, from whō
some lessons are best taught, and their Counsells to
their owne ends doe clearly demonstrate, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of diuers <hi>Iunto's</hi> haue laid for a foundation: It
is happy for <hi>England</hi> to fore-see the blow, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
timely to preuent it: and not be bound to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage
of making a desperate Bett, when the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
shall call, and the game irrecouerable.</p>
   <p>These Demonstrations admitted for true, the next
Consideration will be, by what meanes most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and virtually to worke a iust defence; Wherein if
<pb n="14" facs="9"/>
the Ends, Counsells, and Wayes, whereby <hi>Spaine</hi>
hath in few yeares aduanced, bee obserued, they will
reflect a true light vpon the contrary, how they may
be humbled.</p>
   <p>The end of <hi>Spaine</hi> is <hi>Vniuersall Monarchy,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the <hi>Romans</hi> in all; but the noble contempt
of <hi>Treasons:</hi> Herein, and in Counsells, they haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of vs. It must then be concluded to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this end, wee must resolue the like, and pursue it
with the like wayes, and Counsells, (except onely the
wayes of <hi>Darkenesse</hi>) to take from them those ranke
parts, which nourish this Concupiscence.</p>
   <p>To discouer the right line of this opposition, it
may be enquired, what <hi>Spaine</hi> did aduance in the last
warre, in the blessed dayes of the <hi>glorious Queene
Elizabeth,</hi> either vpon <hi>England, France, Germany, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
or <hi>Holland,</hi> and the totall summe shall be found
nothing. Whether they lost in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of their
owne, is not the question, for the warre was in the
end defensiue, and hee is beaten, that assailing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
not; But that the <hi>Indies</hi> were not able to supply,
nor appease the mutinies of his Souldiers, nor to pay
the Interests of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and that they had lost all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and sought peace on all sides <hi>precariò,
Hoochstrat,</hi> the <hi>Electo's,</hi> their <hi>Bills protested, their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailng
Fryars, their owne Ambassages</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi>
are irrefutable witnesses.</p>
   <p>To account what they haue gotten in these latter
yeares of <hi>Peace,</hi> onely by <hi>peace,</hi> besides the daring so
bold an Act, as to expell many Millions of inborne
Enemies, and thereby raising another <hi>Indea</hi> of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for a designed warre, at the spring tyde of their
<pb n="15" facs="9"/>
full Coffers, would, if it lay together, make a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
estate for a moderate Prince. Somewhat in this
point hath beene touched in a generall enumeration,
but particulars do fully instruct. <hi>Alarache</hi> in <hi>Barbarie,</hi>
to strengthen their South Coasts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to
helpe to shut vp the Streights of <hi>Gibralterra; Acon,</hi>

of Conscience, the <hi>Reformed Magistrates</hi> banished,
and the Citie reduced to their <hi>Deuotion;</hi> The <hi>non

and thereby <hi>Wesell,</hi> the Retraict, and Sanctuary

and the Inheritance of the <hi>Heyres</hi> of <hi>Cleue</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
vnder the title of protection, and kept as a
pledge; The <hi>Palatinate</hi> distributed to their <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi>
but the Ports and Fortresses of Importance
held in hostage; And thus <hi>Holland</hi> surrounded; The

<hi>Hungary</hi> intailed, and the <hi>Nobility</hi> spoiled of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
of free Election; The <hi>Euangeliques</hi> vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exiled and oppressed; And all <hi>Germany</hi> trembling
vnder the example: <hi>These are the fruits of a Spanish
peace.</hi> If the slumbring Lyon bite so mortally, what
shall hee doe, enraged after his pursued <hi>Prey?</hi> And if in
<hi>peace,</hi> contrary to the nature of <hi>peace,</hi> such achieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are obtained, that the ship of <hi>Spaine</hi> runne in
the night so many leagues, while the Pilot seemes to

end of Conquest.<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
      <hi>Sapiens non semper it vno gradu, sed

   </p>
   <p>From these examples wee must learne <hi>bellum

<pb n="16" facs="10"/>
where the <hi>Spanish Empire</hi> is most sensible and
weake; but exhibit some generall rules, that Riuers
are onely to be preuented of their waters, by stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
or diuerting their fountaines. <hi>Aegypt</hi> depends
vpon the courtesie and payes tribute to the King of
<hi>Ethiopia</hi> to giue leaue to <hi>Nilus</hi> to water it. The body
is soonest reduced to a consumption, by destroying
the <hi>Liuer,</hi> the <hi>Indies</hi> of blood; And then demonstrate
these <hi>axioms</hi> by a fewe <hi>Roman and Spanish Parallels,</hi>
what they did, and what they suffered, and leaue the
application to Actiue men.</p>
   <p>That Princely People had no <hi>Indies,</hi> but their <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
Rome</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> was all; while they caried
their Armies abroad, they had no returnes but victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and triumph, and they could loose nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
men, that sold their liues dearely. But when their
<hi>Emuli</hi> the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> discouered by their Inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> that their ambition had no limits, and
considered that while they fought for their owne
ground, they could get nothing, but blowes; They
resolued to send <hi>Haniball</hi> to the Gates of <hi>Rome:</hi>
where he reduced that <hi>Empire</hi> to nothing, but a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of braue old men, prepared to dye in <hi>Maiestie.</hi>
Eighteene yeares this glorious Captaine trode on the
spoiles of <hi>Italy,</hi> and doubtlesse had finished that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and in that day, in which he turned to <hi>Capua</hi>
had supped in the <hi>Capitoll,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hor.</note>
      <hi>Si quemadmodum sciret

prouerb▪ <hi>Capuam Hanibali, Cannas fuisse.</hi> We must
not trust in errors, nor hope this Courtesie of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
   <p>When the young <hi>Scipio</hi> reuiued the hearts of the
<pb n="17" facs="10"/>
      <hi>Romans</hi> by vndertaking the Prouince of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
where his Father and Vncle, and so many <hi>Legions</hi>
were buried, he found three Armies greater then his
owne,<note place="margin">Polib.</note> to oppose him. <hi>Vulgaria omnia consilia, &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
venire in mentem cuiusuis poterat, omisit.</hi> To fight
with all at once was impossible; to beginne with one
desperate; the other two were at his back, entire,
<hi>vincendo, vinceretur.</hi> And fortune must not be often
tempted; But when he fell vpon the consideration,
that new C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rthage was the fountaine from whence
all the diuisions were supplied, the Port, and harbour
of succours, he resolued, <hi>omnes vnà aggredi;</hi> by taking
that City, to dry vp the streames at the spring head;
Thus the Enemies retraict &amp; storehouse became his,
<hi>tota Regio in vna vrbe superataest,</hi> and he changed the
face of the whole warre, by one deliberation, and
was victorious without the vncertaine tryall of <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
dubium an vtiliori falicioriue concilio.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, when there was no other way to retire <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi>
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> this fate of <hi>Carthage</hi> vndertooke
to transport the warre to their own doores; and then,
hee that neuer refused to fight, treated, sought peace,
and almost confessed that he was vanquished; then he
made that pittifull oration, the most inglorious of all
his Acts:<note place="margin">Hanib. ad Scip.</note>
      <hi>Si nunc esset integrum, optaturum se fore, vt
neque Romani quicquam vnquam eorum quae sunt extra
Italiam, nec Carthagenienses, eorum, quae extra Affricam
concupiscent.</hi> To this moderation must <hi>Spaine</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
<hi>Haniball</hi> knew hee might safelier haue lost all
his battells within the <hi>Alpes,</hi> then one at the gates of
<hi>Carthage:</hi> In them he aduentured nothing, but the
superfluity of youthfull blood, which <hi>en gaijetè de
<pb n="18" facs="11"/>
coeur,</hi> sought their desteny in the field of honour.
But now the Common-wealth was at stake, and they
plaied their <hi>Altars, Liberties, Wiues, and Children,</hi> at
one game; <hi>Haniball,</hi> to auoid this desteny attempted
<hi>Italy,</hi> to wast <hi>Rome</hi> at their owne charges. But <hi>Scipio</hi>
had learned that wisedome of him, which himselfe
could not vse, and finished at once a double warre:
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> imitating the one part, shewes vs
the way to take the other; <hi>Spaine,</hi> while it was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Kingdome threatned no body, and in <hi>Spaine</hi> litl e
is to be gotten, where me ate must be supplied, and a
victorious Army may starue. Therefore, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the roote, it must bee sought from whence this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
of ambition ariseth: and as in naturall Bodies,
there are other parts, besides the head and the heart,
which being cut off, or wounded, cause desolution, so
it is possible to find a way to weaken that Monster,
which cannot bee killed at one blow.</p>
   <p>Great preparations at mighty expences giue too
great warning, are subiect to many accidents and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
too much reputation. And if one <hi>State</hi> know
any one <hi>Designe</hi> that may much annoy the Enemy, it
is like the other is not ignorant of their owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Wise Gamesters play not all at a Cast, the <hi>By,</hi>
often helpes the <hi>Maine.</hi> Therfore, both rule &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hath taught vs, that <hi>Spaine</hi> is more easily wasted,
then any part of their <hi>Christian Dominion</hi> conquered,
while the streame of money is open, and vndiuerted.
But if this long and sure course threaten also a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
Consumption, yet that warre in <hi>Europe</hi> will
bee most profitable for vs, which shall be made nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
our owne Kingdome, both for the keeping our

forces vnited, and at hand, and for the easinesse of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in all Euents; and out of <hi>Europe,</hi> by a Roiall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is not impossible at one stroke, to behead the
<hi>Indies,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To oppose them in their Counsels we must first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
what they are,<note place="margin">Pierre Mat.</note>

   </p>
   <p>Sedition, separation, and disunion are the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
weapons wherewith they prepare to themselues
easie Conquests, and these Arts haue their first effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
vnder the pretence of Treaty, then is the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
most to be suspected,<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> because they know how <hi>hostibus

The contrary then, which is a firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
League, is onely powerfull, and able to arrest
them. In the Colleagued warre of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
of <hi>Greece</hi> against the vnited power of the

diuide <hi>indivisibile</hi> is lost labour, the Designes of <hi>Spaine</hi>
are one, vnited in the head, <hi>in genere generalissimo,</hi> the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which cannot be distracted. They
haue no other maine and important adherent, but the
Pope, and his Ecclesiasticall Dependents, and these
also make but one, and meet in the Center, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="20" facs="12"/>
in common and mingled ends. And they greatly
erre, who suppose, that it is euer possible to finde a
Pope vnpartiall for <hi>Spaine,</hi> or to fauour any other
Prince against them. Let <hi>Vrban</hi> the Eighth serue for
an example, rais'd and fed by <hi>France,</hi> yet fallen to
their enemies, <hi>per ragione di stato.</hi> One fresh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
instance will discouer both this vnitie, and the
aduantage of Spanish Counsells. When the Treaty
of <hi>Madrid</hi> for the liberty of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and roundly pressed by the <hi>French,</hi> some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
remaining, to prolong the possession, the Forts
of that Vally were, by consent, deliuered to the Pope,
<hi>tanquam communi Patri in Deposito.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This seemed very equall, but the <hi>French</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reached;
For they hoped vpon the iustice of their
Cause, and that a sentence would timely be giuen for
them, which was impossible: For the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was
content, that the Deposition should remaine for euer
to his vse; and he knew that the Pope, by accepting
it, was engag'd neuer to surrender to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>spirituall</hi> Father could neuer deliuer his
Children (behold another title) to the subiection and
will of Heretiques: and if the <hi>French</hi> should at last
vse force, his <hi>Holinesse</hi> was doubly intangled, both in
honor and conscience, to vnite with <hi>Spaine,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his Depositation. This the <hi>French</hi> did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
and fel vpon a disaduantage to recouer it from the
Pope, a matter of dangerous consequence. Who, at
last, takes Armes in the Cause, as the World knowes.
But when both the Pope and <hi>Spaine</hi> saw such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
storme, and Colleguation, and foresaw, that there
was no remedie but to lose it by Armes, which being
<pb n="21" facs="12"/>
victorious, might quarrell with <hi>Millan,</hi> or finde new
obiects of their disdaine, they resolued rather to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
it, and to seeme to yeeld to Iustice. But who
must doe it? The Pope by no meanes can consent to
deliuer part of his flocke to wolues, so his Ambassage
protested in <hi>France,</hi> therefore, by secret conniuence
and agreement, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> doth suddenly seale
the old Articles, and makes the Transaction before
<hi>Barbarini</hi> shall arriue, to saue the Popes honor: For
a temporall Prince may <hi>saluâ conscientiâ</hi> restore <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>
to their temporall rights, which the Pope, a
higher pretender, ouer soule, body and goods, cannot
doe. By this cunning they hope to separate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vnited, the quarrell being, in outward appearance,
ended; and by this Intelligence it is euident, that the
<hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> serue one another, and take
turnes, and shift Interests, for mutuall aduantage. But
if examples proue not <hi>categorically</hi> let it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall Monarchies,</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> haue such mutuall interest
and affinitie, and are so woven one within the other,
that though natural affection, or other respects of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
may for a time retard, &amp; perhaps striue against
an open declaration, yet when necessitie exacteth a
resolution, the essence and mystery of the <hi>Papacie</hi> will
preuaile: It must forsake father and mother, and
cleaue to this double supremacie; for <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi>
must stand and fall together.</p>
   <p>To proceed, when the <hi>Romans</hi> first transported
their Legions into <hi>Greece,</hi> they were called in by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to restore that shew of liberty to a part, which
they absolutely tooke from all <hi>Greece.</hi> Separation and
<pb n="22" facs="13"/>
disunion by them fomented, opened a Port to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
which vnited, was like their <hi>Phalanx,</hi> not to
be broken. And certainly this day, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue
more hope to diuide the Princes colleagued, then to
vanquish them: To which vse, they haue two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Instruments, <hi>Money</hi> for the <hi>Traitor,</hi> and a <hi>Pope</hi>
for the <hi>Conscience.</hi> It is obserued, that <hi>Spaine</hi> will buy

   <p>I will not enter into a search of the Treaties of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> nor how they are maintained; I will not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

onely I may haue leaue to note, that anciently some
States were branded, there was prouerbially <hi>Fides
Punica,</hi> and <hi>Foedus Locrense;</hi> and therefore I admonish
all good Townes, which capitulate to haue no Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell

by the Confederate warre <hi>du bien public,</hi> wherein
his brother, the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Caralois,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Bretagny</hi> were engaged, desired aydes of money, hee
supplied the King with a good Counsell,<note place="margin">Comines.</note> to agree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conditions, with any of the League, to disband, or
to sowe a iealousie among them; preseruing onely his
Armes entire, with which, whē they were separated,
he might humble them singly, at his pleasure; adding,
that Princes lost no reputation, when they attained
their ends. The History is vulgar, and the successe of
that aduice, was, the flight of the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> the
staine of <hi>Charles of Burgundy,</hi> and the beggery of
<hi>Bretagny.</hi> I am perswaded, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
the Doctrine, and would come to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with any of the Leagues, to disunite them: and
the Breach once made is not easily repaired. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in this Coniuncture, they would (if honour
would suffer it) consent to make a generall <hi>peace,</hi>
vntill Armes were deposed; But here is the present
danger, to loose an opportunity, not to bee recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in many yeares. The Counsell of <hi>Spaine</hi> doth
know at how great expence of time, and charge of
Ambassages, these Leagues haue beene composing;
which once dissolued, and lulled asleepe in security,
would slowly returne to the present perfection.
Therefore there is great Caution to be vsed, in giuing
eare to the Enchantments of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Treaty: For

and outward Counsells waighed with <hi>vtile</hi>
and <hi>honestum;</hi> yet there is a secret fit to bee reuealed,
That the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> haue a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
which may approue, or annull all that is, or shall bee
transacted, and dormant dispensations, which haue
<pb n="25" facs="14"/>
reference to Contingences <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi>
to continue or dissolue all Conclusions: and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict
is formed like waxe, to take the Impression of
the present aspect and necessity of affaires.</p>
   <p>In the last treaty betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> in
which <hi>Amiens</hi> was surprised, when King <hi>Phillip</hi> saw
the vigorous resolutiō of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth to recouer
the Townes in <hi>Picardy</hi> by the sword, and that he had
giuen expresse Command to the <hi>President de Silerye</hi>
to consent to no Conuention, so long as one foote of
ground vnsurrendered, remained in the possession of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> considering, that the bounds of that
Prouince were the entrance into <hi>Artois,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pierre</note> and that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Armies extend their pretences with prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Math.</note>
especially the Title of <hi>Soueraignty</hi> inuiting, and
iustifying that progresse, he consulted first, his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
of <hi>State,</hi> for the restitution, who, loath to remit
any thing of their stiffnesse, interposed the respects of
honour, and so it was necessary, not to confesse ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to keepe them; but the wise King, knowing, to
contend might draw the quarrell into the bowells of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> resoluing both to preuent the occasion, and
to saue his reputation, called his <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi>
to deliuer their opinion, who concluded, that hee
could not by the Lawes of Religion vsurpe, nor dye
with quietnesse of soule, if he restored not to euery
man his owne: and so those places were piously sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered,
which could not safely be maintained; But
Conscience extended no further, then present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
   <p>When the same <hi>Catholique</hi> King found it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for <hi>Spanish</hi> reason of <hi>State,</hi> that his own braue and
<pb n="26" facs="15"/>
eldest sonne should dye, Nature; and honour both,
contended against the <hi>Sentence;</hi> but obligations were
pretended, and found, aboue humanity, as the Act
was without humanity. The <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
and to these a <hi>Iunto of Diuines</hi> were added, to resolue
the tender Conscience of a Father, whether
hee might with safety of Conscience pardon his
owne Child of offences not yet fully published and
therefore for euer suspected.<note place="margin">Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

fauour the Prince could obtaine, was to choose
his death, that which was preferred and enioyed by
<hi>Caesar; &amp; facinus intragloriam fuit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Before <hi>Alua</hi> appeared neere <hi>Portugall</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> and <hi>Don Christofero di Mora,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cones.</note>
were imploied to buy a party for the <hi>Catholique King,</hi>
and they promised mountaines of Gold, to withdraw
some of the Lords from <hi>Don Antonio.</hi> When the
kingdome was setled, these did demand their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and pleaded their Contracts in the name, and
by vertue of the Kings order: Who remitted them,
not to the Counsell of <hi>State,</hi> for they must iustifie
their owne Acts, but to that of <hi>Conscience;</hi> Who gaue
sentence, that if the Crowne belonged to <hi>Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
they could not rightfully conferre it vpon <hi>Phillip.</hi>
If <hi>Phillip</hi> were the true heire, the Petitioners could
not sell their Allegiance to their owne Prince, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
so that both wayes they were iudged Traytors,
and their expected reward was changed into a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pardon. I conclude, Nothing is sure, without the
approbation of this Court of Conscience; Nothing
<pb n="27" facs="15"/>
so vnsure, as what Law, or equitie is the rule thereof.
Therfore, that Peace onely will be secure with <hi>Spaine,</hi>
which the two Counsells of State, and Conscience
shall together resolue, to be profitable, because neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</p>
   <p>To reduce this Discourse to a briefe Conclusion,
If right iudgement of all <hi>States</hi> arise from their ends;
If their Counsells direct the way to discouer them,
and both being discerned to affect Conquest, must
be actiuely opposed, lest they preuaile vpon a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
modestie; If the ends of <hi>Spaine</hi> are apparently
<hi>Vniversall Monarchy,</hi> and all their Counsells, by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
infamous, and vnchristian, or by practises
of fomenting Treasons, and diuisions among their
neighbours, are directed to attaine that end; If the
Pope must be alway obsequious for the affinity of
their common ends; If there be no securitie of
Peace, but in their pouerty: What other resolution
can bee proposed, then that a liuely warre must bee
transported to that part of the Dominions of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
which being separated and cut off, the ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and naturall constitution of that Kingdome
may returne, to bee glad to liue in Peace, and eate
quietly their owne Figs and Oliues. And because in
great diseases, as well blood and ill humours must
be diuerted, as the main Cure intended; so it wil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
more for expedition then necessitie of health,
to imitate other States in thrift. <hi>France</hi> in times past,
had <hi>Scotland, England, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Navarre;
Spaine</hi> their owne <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> euery king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had a back-friend vpon their Enemies. Such
may be found vpon the weakest side of the House
<pb n="28" facs="16"/>
of <hi>Austria, Port d' Atras,</hi> drawne from their owne
Confessions, that though the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Hungary</hi> &amp; <hi>Bohemia</hi> will neuer be secure vntill the
Hills of <hi>Transylvania</hi> be made the Bulwarke of their
Empire. But this would be too large a Digression.</p>
   <p>There remaines onely of my purpose, to preuent a
Question; why I haue chosen to dedicate, by this
Epistle, the ensuing Translation, to you most worthy
Senators of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi> For this boldnes
may be subiect to various misinterpretations. No mā
will suspect me of so great arrogance, as that I hope
to teach you any thing you doe not know. But seeing
your owne wisedome did first foresee the necessity
of a warre with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and your owne zeale to the
honour of your King, did counsell to vndertake it, I
thought such forraine Meditations as these, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with your owne thoughts, might also animate
and nourish in you a spirit, and generous Resolution,
vigorously to maintaine it. You know how much of
the good successe of great Actions depends vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and they haue aduanced much, who haue
gotten opinion. As <hi>Astrologers</hi> make their iudgments
vpon the first minute of time in Natiuities, so doth
the world prognosticate of the happy successes of
Princes, by the first coniunctures in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and their first actions abroad: Therefore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standum
fame, nam vt prima cessissent, fore vniuersa.</hi>
You know,<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> Monies are the sinewes of warre,<note place="margin">Idem.</note>
      <hi>Neque
arma sine stipendijs, neque stipendia sine tributis, haberi
queunt.</hi> If you now restraine your liberall hand, you
expose your Prince to dishonor, and your Country to
Consumption. It is Time onely that will macerate
<pb n="29" facs="16"/>
      <hi>England,</hi> when without traffique and exchange, and
that especially of <hi>Germany,</hi> our owne treasure must be
exported to pay forraine Armies. <hi>Qui citò dat, bis dat,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
and it is ill husbandry to doe that sparingly, which
cannot be well done but at once and speedily. It will
be time to be thrifty in the members and particulars,
when the Head and the whole <hi>State</hi> is safe. And if
you deferre vntill a lingring warre hath exhausted
you, Remember that which remaines will not suffice,
because <hi>sera in fundo parsimonia; non enim minimum,</hi>
