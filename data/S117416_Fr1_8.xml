   <head>THE TESTIMONIE OF <hi>Adrianus Barlandus,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Silesio:</hi> in his Historicall observations on <hi>Florence.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ilent I should be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Silesio;</hi> but being daily vers'd in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of his <hi>Labours,</hi> I might seeme conscious to my selfe of envying his worth, if I should seeke to obscur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>, what my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth so highly admire. Truth is, he lived long before us, yet lives hee still with us. For though he dye, his <hi>Annals</hi> live. Now, to render him in his true effigies and expressive Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; He was an Eloquent Orator, an Elegant Poet, and in the maturer

close of his time, an eminent Patritian. In his writing, hee was witty without scurrilous lightnesse, serious without censor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ous sowrenesse. Accurate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation; passionately moving beyond imitation. Hee had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>sse to gaine friends, and to retaine them: which facility in gaining, and felicity in retaining, may bee ascribed to his discretion, who in the whole pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his life was never knowne to lose his friend for a jest: nor entertaine a jealous conceit of his trust without apparant cause. During his aboade at Court, he was much honoured; in his retire, he was much frequented: in both generally loved. Many princely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were showne him by the Duke, which with a native modesty he reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And being demanded by some of his friends, why hee accepted not such gracious tenders, being assured argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his future advancements; hee was wont to answer them: <hi>That those glorious favours were golden fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which might endanger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the liberty of his better part.</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
Being on a time importuned in his youth by two complete Curtezans, to write a Poeme in the praise of beauty; he made answer: <hi>That hee could goe neare to paint them out, but hee thought his Pensill might bee well spar'd, for they knew better how to paint themselves.</hi> He could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to comply with a light friend, saying, <hi>That he who entrusted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a Faune, brought his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in question.</hi> He was affable to his friends, reconcileable to his foes, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate to all. Abstenious in his dyet, civill in his habit, temperate in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. He lived to a ripe age; and was intombed in a Monument of Thracian Marble, within the <hi>Lemnian arch.</hi>
