The same prouidence (I knowe not by what destenie) hath brought me owt of my natiue countrey of Milane, and owt of the citie of Rome (where I continued almost .x. yeares) into Spaine, that I myght particularlye collecte, these marueylous and newe thynges, which shoulde otherwyse perhappes haue line drow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in the whirlepoole of obliuion: forasmuch as the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes (men woorthy greate commendation) had onely care to the generall inuentions of these thynges. Notwithstandinge, I doo not chalenge vnto me only, the thankes of the trauaile bestowed herein, wheras the chiefe rewarde therof is due to Ascanius vicounte Cardinal,<note place="margin">Cardinal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius.</note> who perceauynge that I was wylling to departe owt of the citie to be present at the warres of Granatum,<note place="margin">The warres of Granatum ageynst the Moores.</note> dissuaded me from my purpose. But seing that I was fully resolued to departe, exhorted and required me to wryte vnto hym such newes as were famous in Spayne and woorthy to be noted. I tooke therfore my iorney into Spaine chiefely for the desyre I had to see thexpedition whiche was prepared ageynst the enemies of the fayth: forasmuche as in Italye, by reason of the dissention amonge the Princes, I coulde fynde nothynge wherewith I myght feede my wytte, beinge a younge man desyrous of knowleage and experience of thynges. I was therefore presente at the warres: frome whense I writte to Cardinal Ascanius, and by sundry epistels

certifyed hym of such thynges as I thought moste woorthye to be put in memorie. But when I perceaued that his fortun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Yet after I sawe, that by thouerthrowe of the enemies of owre faythe, Spayne was pourged of the Moores as of an euyll weede plucked vp by the rootes, Leaste I shulde bestowe my slippery yeares in vnprofitable Idlenesse I was mynded to returne to Italie. But the singuler benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of bothe the Catholyke kynge and queene nowe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and theyr large promises towarde me vppon my returne frome my legacie of Babilon, deteyned me frome my purpose.<note place="margin">The autour was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For euen the bludde of mine owne kinsfolkes and frendes, was not free from that crueltie. As I was ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore musynge with my selfe of these thynges, the Cardinal of Arragonie, after that he had seene the two fyrste bookes of my Decades wrytten to Ascanius, required me in the name of kynge Frederike his vncle,<note place="margin">Kynge Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike.</note> to put foorth the other eyght epistell bookes, In the meane tyme also, while I was voyde of all care as touchynge the matters of the Ocean, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall messengers of the bysshopppe of Rome Leo the tenth,<note place="margin">Leo the tenth▪ byshoppe of Rome.</note> (by whose holsome counsayle and autoritie we truste the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Italy shalbe fynysshed) raysed me as it were frome sleape, and encoraged me to proceade as I had begunne. To his holynesse I writte two Decades cōprysed in short bokes after the maner of epistels, and added them to the fyrst, which was printed withowt myne aduise, as shall further appeare by the preface folowynge.
