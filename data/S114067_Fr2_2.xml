   <head>To the right Worshipfull his very good Frend: Maister <hi>William Higham</hi> Esquier, one of her Maiesties Iustices of the Peace in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Essex.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nkind is he, that hauing receiued curtesie at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans hands, denieth it: vnkinde (againe) is he, that dissembleth and will not seeme to know it: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde likewise is hee, that studieth not one way or other to requite it: but of all others, the most vnkind and vnthankefull is he, that quite forgetteth it.</p>
   <p>Much to blame therfore were I (good <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Higham</hi>) if for the manifolde benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from you, I should either denye, conceale, misregard or forget, how deeply I stād in your debt Booke: or what a number of Arrerages I am behinde withall in your Iournall, in respect of that great heape of curtesies, which I frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly confesse in full measure to haue flowed from you towards mee.</p>
   <p>Neither may I (without blushing) preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, how deepely I rest beholding to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull father in law, my especiall good Friend
<pb facs="28"/>
Maister <hi>Richard Stonley:</hi> neither yet can J in honestie conceale the great curtesie that I daylie to my comfort receiue, by and frō your good Cosen my deare Friend and louing neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Maister <hi>W. Waldgraue.</hi> I wil not here speake of your learned brother in lawe, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>D. Dunne,</hi> to whom also I owe greater things, euen my self. No way am I able (J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) to requite any of you, but you remember (I doubt not) what one saith: <hi>Mola salsa litāt, qui thura non habent.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Jn part of payment, &amp; for some discharge of duetie, loe here (good Sir) I boldly present vnto you (and in you also to them) this my simple trauaile of three daies, in translating this godly and profitable worke of <hi>Danaeus.</hi> What effect it shall worke in others I know not: but (surely) if they like no worse of it in reading, then I my selfe haue done both in reading, aduising and translating of it, their labour shall not bee lost, nor their diligence wastfully bestowed. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending therefore both it and my poore selfe vnto you J end: wishing you and your good wife, no worse to fare, then your vertue requireth, the fauour of men wisheth, and your owne dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie promiseth. </p>
