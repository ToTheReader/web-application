   <head>TO THE READER:
Of what qualitie soeuer.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Inde Syr:</hi> Which dish in this poore
feast of Epistles, is for your tast, I know
not, for they are as various as mens
pallates, but which may most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
giue you a surfait is all,
Curiosity and my forme of writing, hauing euer
beene at a perpetuall dissention, but since all mens
vvritings haue a predestinate end, of good or euill,
hanging vpon them, I must hazard amongst the
multitude, and though the subiect I write of hath ben
handled by many, and many of a great deale more
merit, yet I haue runne so farre from the lisping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of ill imbrodred speech, or from the rude
plainnesse of too much dulnesse, that when my booke
shall be paraleld with others, it will speake sufficiently
to get it selfe a free passage, nothing being in it I
hope vnworthy, nothing that may not very vvell
authorize imitation. Neither doe I ascribe to my selfe
the grounds of euery inuention, for there be many
due to such excellencies as no man can controle, no
man equall: nor is mine intent here to end, for it is
but the beginning of a much better worke, as my
<pb facs="4"/>
next booke shall witnesse, which with all diligence
shall follow this, contayning those formes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
which neuer yet haue beene published in
any Epistles, and vvhich I doubt not but shall
giue to euery breast all the satisfaction that
can be expected. And so vvishing
vnto you what your heart can
wish to it selfe, I leaue my
loue and my booke
with you.</p>
