   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou must ceasse to maruell, my
good cuntreymen of Scotland,
that I haue caused this booke
printed in our cuntrey of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lād
to be published altogither in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
phrase &amp; orthographie. For the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is vvel enough knovvne to our cū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymē:
And the chief cause of my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
it, was for our good neighbors the
Englishmē, to whō we are so hiely bound,
&amp; vpon whose good Queene at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
in policie dependeth the chiefe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>aye
of Gods Churche in Christendome. I
knovv not vvhatrespects haue stayed the
learned of that land from setting out this
historie: Therfore supposing the causes
to be such as I conceiue them, I haue ben
bolde to set it forthe in their language in
our cuntrey. And you, good cuntreymē,
that haue receiued so honorable succors
from England, and frō vvhenceal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
hopeth for charitable assistāce,
must be content to yelde that this is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to serue their vnderstanding: Ye
<pb facs="3"/>
Englishmen our good neighbors, frends,
brethrē, and patrons, I pray you conster
rightly of my labour, that my purpose is
not here to offend any amitie, nor violate
any honor, nor preiudice any truth, but
to set before you astorie as I found it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the confirmation thereof to truth
and prooues, as in all historicall cases is
lavvfully vsed. How many histories writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Latine, Italian &amp; French, by Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,
Paradine, Belleforest and other, are
printed in Italie, Fraunce and Flaunders,
and published &amp; freely had and read in
your land, although they contain matter
expresly to the sclander of your state and
princes? Matters of that nature are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
the burden of prouing resteth vpon
the author, the iudgement pertaineth to
the reader, there is no preiudice to anye
part, Bokes are extant on both parts. The
very treatises of diuinitie are not al vvarā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that be printed, you must take it as it
is, onely for matter of reporte on the one
parte, so farre to binde credit as it carieth
<pb facs="4"/>
euidence to furnish your vnderstandings,
as other bokes do that make rehearsals of
the actes &amp; states of princes, cōmō weales
and peoples. But howsoeuer it be, good
Englishmen, thanke God that you haue
such a soueraigne, vnder vvhō you suffer
no such things, &amp; by the noble &amp; sincere
aide that your good Queene hath giuen
vs in Scotland, I pray you gather a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortable
confidēce, that in respect of such
honorable charitie to his church in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
god vvil not suffer you at your nede
to be succorlesse in England, as by dayly
miracles in preseruing your Queene he
hath plainly shevved: and the rather ye
may trust hereof, if ye be thankeful and
faithful to God &amp; hir, &amp; that ye pray har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to God, either by mediate operation
of your Queenes iustice, or by his ovvne
immediate hand vvorking, to deliuer his
church &amp; people frō the cōmon perill to
both these realms, &amp; to the state of al true
religiō in christēdome. Farewel, and God
long preserue bothe your good and oure
hopeful soueraigne to his glory. Amen.</p>
