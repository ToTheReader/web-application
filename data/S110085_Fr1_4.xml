   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ell said my Maisters, I
perceyue there cannot a
new Booke come forth but
you will haue a fling at it.
Say, what are you read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<hi>Nashe</hi> against <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey.</hi>
Fo, thats a stale ieast,
hee hath been this two or
three yeare about it. O
good Brother <hi>Timothie</hi>
rule your reason, the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
gryndes more mens corne than one: and those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
goe through with anie quarrell, must set all their
wordly busines at a stay, before they draw it to the poynt.
I will not gainsay, but I haue cherisht a purpose of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
this Liff-lander <hi>Bogarian</hi> so long time as ye speak
of, and that like the long snouted Beast (whose backe is
Castle proofe) carrying her yong in her wombe three yere
ere she be deliuered, I haue been big with childe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
place of reuenge, euer since the hanging of <hi>Lopus:</hi>
but to say I plodded vpon it continually, and vsed in all
this space nothing but gall to make inke with, is a lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
a base swabberly lowsie sailer, who hauing been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
but a month at sea in his life, and duckt at the maine
yards arme twice or thrice for pilferie, when hee comes
<pb facs="13"/>
home sweares hee hath been seuenteene yeares in the
Turkes Gallies.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Patientia vestra,</hi> there is not one pint of wine more
than the iust Bill of costs and charges in setting forth, to
be got by ame of these bitter-sanced Inuectines. Some
fool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h praise perhaps we may mecte with, such as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded
to ordinarie I esters that make sport: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we are like those fugitiue Priests in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi>
whom the Pope (veric liberally) prefers to Irish
Bishoprickes, but allowes them not a pennie of any liuing
to maintaine them with, saue onely certaine Friers to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
them.</p>
   <p>High titles (as they of Bishops and Prelates) so of
Poets and VVriters we haue in the world, when in stead
of their begging Friers, the fire of our wit is left, as our
onely last refuge to warme vs.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Haruey</hi> and I (a couple of beggers) take vpon vs to
bandie factions, and contend like the <hi>Vrsini</hi> and <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>
in <hi>Roome:</hi> or as the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> about
<hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Mortus Alli,</hi> which should bee the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test:
and (with the <hi>Indians</hi>) head our inuentions ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
with Vipers teeth, and sleep them in the bloud
of Adders and Serpents, and spend as much time in
arguing <hi>Pro &amp; contra,</hi> as a man might haue found
out the quadrature of the Circle in: when all the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
is no more but this, he began with mee, and cannot
tell how to make an end; and I would fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> end or rid
my hands of him, if he had not first begun.</p>
   <p>I protest I doo not write against him because I hate
him, but that I would confirme and plainly shew to a
number of weake beleeuers in my sufficiencie, that I am
able to answere him: and his frends and not his enemies
<pb facs="13"/>
let him thanke for this heauie load of disgrace I lay vpon
him, since theyr extreame disabling of mee in this kinde,
&amp; vrging what a triumph he had ouer me, hath made me
to ransacke my standish more than I would.</p>
   <p>This I will boldly say, looke how long it is since he writ
against me, so long haue I giuen him a lease of his life, &amp;
he hath onely held it by my mercie.</p>
   <p>His Booke or <hi>Magna Charta</hi> which against M. <hi>Lilly</hi> &amp;
me he addrest, I hauing kept idle by me in a by settle out of
sight amongst old shooes and bootes almost this two yere,
and in meere pitie of him would neuer looke vpon it but
in some calme pleasing humor, for feare least in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
too cruelly I should haue martyrd him.</p>
   <p>And yet though vengeance comes not <hi>Zephiris &amp; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundine
prima,</hi> in the first springing prime of his schisme
and heresie, let him not looke for one of Frier <hi>Tecelius</hi>
Pardons, he that (as <hi>Sleidane</hi> reports) first stird vp <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
pronouncing from the Pope free salarie indulgence
to anie man, though he had deflowred the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi>
and absolution as well for sinnes past as sinnes to come:
for I meane to come vpon him with a tempest of thunder
and lightning, worse than the stormes in the VVest <hi>Indies</hi>
cald the <hi>Furicanoes,</hi> and compleate arme more words for
his confusion, than <hi>Wezell</hi> in <hi>Germanie</hi> is able to arme
men, that hath absolute furniture for three hundred
thousand at all times.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen, what think ye of this sober mortified stile?
I dare say a number of ye haue drawn it to a verdit alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
and as an Elephants fore-legs are longer than his
hinder, so you imagine my former confutation wilbe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than my latter. Nay then, <hi>Aesopum non attriuistis,</hi>
you are as ignorant in the true mounings of my Muse, as
<pb facs="14"/>
the Astronomers are in the true mouings of <hi>Mars,</hi> which
to this day they could neuer attaine too. For how euer in
the first setting foorth I martch faire and softly like a
man that rides vpon his owne horse, and like the <hi>Caspian</hi>
sea seeme neither to ebbe nor flow, but keep a smooth plain
for me in my el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>quence, as one of the <hi>Lacedemonian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori,</hi>
or <hi>Baldwin</hi> in his morrall sentences (which now
are all snatcht vp for Painters posies): yet you shall see
me in two or three leaues hence, crie Heigh for our towne
greene, and powre hot boyling inke on this contemptible
Heggledepegs barrain scalp, as men condemned for stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by <hi>Richard de corde Lions</hi> law, had hot boyling
pitch powrd on their heads, and feathers strewd vppor,
that wheresoeuer they came they might be knowne.</p>
   <p>I know I am too long in preparing an entrance into my
Text, <hi>sed tandem denique</hi> to the matter and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
   <p>The method I meane to vse in persecuting this <hi>Peter
Maluenda</hi> and <hi>Sinibaldo Crasko</hi> is no more but this.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Memorandum,</hi> I frame my whole Booke in the nature
of a Dialogue, much like <hi>Bullen</hi> and his Doctor <hi>Tocrub,</hi>
whereof the Interlocuters are these.</p>
   <p>Inprimis, Senior Importunio, <hi>the Opponent.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The second <hi>Grand Consiliadore,</hi> chiefe Censor or
Moderat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r.</p>
   <p>The third <hi>Domino Bentiuole,</hi> one that stands as
it were at the line in a Tennis-court, and takes euerie ball
at the volly.</p>
   <p>The fourth <hi>Don Carneades de boone Compagnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
who like a busie Countrey Iustice sits on the Bench, and
preacheth to the eues out of their own confessions: or rather
like a Quarter-master or Treasurer of Bride-well, whose
<pb facs="14"/>
office is to giue so manie strokes with the hammer, as the
publican vnchast offender is to haue stripes, and by the
same <hi>Tuballs</hi> musique to warne the blue-coate Corrector
when he should patience and surcease: so continually,
when by <hi>Senior Importunio</hi> the Doctor is brought to the
Crosse, <hi>Don Carneades</hi> sets downe what proportion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is to be executed vpon him, and when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is backe hath
bled sufficient, giues a signall of retrayt.</p>
   <p>Neither would I haue you imagine that all these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages
are fained, like <hi>Americke Vesputius,</hi> &amp; the rest
of the <hi>Antwerpe</hi> Speakers in <hi>Sir Thomas Moores Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia:</hi>
for as true as <hi>Bankes</hi> his Horse knowes a Spaniard
from an English-man, or there went vp one and twentie
Maides to the top of <hi>Boston</hi> Steeple, and there came but
one downe againe, so true it is that there are men which
haue dealt with me in the same humour that heere I shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
In some nooke or blind angle of the <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> you
may suppose (if you will) this honest conference to bee
held, after the same manner that one of these <hi>Italionate</hi>
conferences about a <hi>Duell</hi> is wont solemnly to be handled,
which is, when a man being specially toucht in reputation,
or challenged to the field vpon equall tearmes, calls all
his frends together, and askes their aduice how he should
carrie himselfe in the action.</p>
   <p>Him that I tearme <hi>Senior Importuno,</hi> is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of good qualitie, to whom I rest manie waies behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and one (as the Philosophers say of winde, that it
is nothing but aire vehemently moou'd) so hath hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ceast with all the vehemence of winde or breath that
he hath, to incite and mooue me to win my spurres in this
iourney.</p>
   <p>Vnder <hi>Grand Consiliadore,</hi> I allude to a graue reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb facs="15"/>
Gimnosophist, (<hi>Amicorum amicissimus,</hi> of all my
Frends the most zealous) that as <hi>Aesculapius</hi> built an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of the Sunne at <hi>Athens,</hi> so is his Chamber an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or Conuocation Chappell of sound counsaile, for all
the better sort of the sonnes of understanding about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and (as it were) an usuall market of good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
and conference.</p>
   <p>Hee also (as well as <hi>Senior Impor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>uno</hi>) hath dealt
with me verie importunately, to employ all my Forces in
this Expedition, and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preserued the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Coos</hi> from a great plague or mortalitie (generally
dispersed throughout <hi>Greece</hi>) by perswading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
fires in publique places, whereby the aire might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risied:
so hath hee (in most feruent deuotion to my well
dooing) un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>essantly perswaded me to preserue my credit
from iadish dying of the <hi>scratches,</hi> by powerfull through
enkindling this <hi>Pinego Riminos</hi> euerlasting fire of
damnation.</p>
   <p>For <hi>Domino Bentiuole</hi> and <hi>Don Carneades de
boune compagniola,</hi> they be men that haue as full shares
in my lous and affection as the former.</p>
   <p>The antecedent of the two, besides true resolution and
valure, (where with he hath ennobled his name extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie)
and a ripe pleasant wit in conuersing, hath in
him a perfect unchangeable true habit of honestie, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Arte of Musique, which the Professours thereof
affirme to be infinite and without end.</p>
   <p>And for the subsequent or hindermost of the paire,
who likewise is none of the unworthiest retainers to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Bessona,</hi> hee is another <hi>Florentine Poggius,</hi> for

the ancient Records and Presidents of ingenuous Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegs
and Emblemes were burnt, (as <hi>Polidore Virgill</hi>
in King <hi>Harry</hi> the eights time burnt all the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the true beginning of this our I le, after hee had
finished his Chronicle) yet out of his affluent capacitie
they were to be renewed and reedified farre better.</p>
   <p>These foure with my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>elfe, whom I personate as the
Respondent in the last place, shall (according as God wil
giue them grace) clap up a <hi>Colloquium</hi> amongst them,
and so schoole my gentle <hi>Comrade</hi> or neighbor <hi>Quiquiffe</hi>
in some few short principles of my learning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,
that (I doubt not) by that time they haue concluded
and dispatcht with him, my <hi>Gorboduck Huddleduddle</hi>
will gladly (on his knees) resigne to mee his Doctoursh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

and as <hi>Antisthenes</hi> could not beate <hi>Diogenes</hi> away from
him, but he would needes be his scholler whether he would
or no: so shall I haue him haunt me up and downe to be
my prentise to learne to endite, and doo what I can I shall
not be shut of him.</p>
   <p>This is once, I both can and wilbe shut presently of
this tedious Chapter of contents, least where as I prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it as an antipast to whet your stomacks, it cleane take
away your stomackes, and you surfet of it before meate

in reading my Booke, which Aristotle prescribes to
them that read Histories, namely, that they bee not <hi>nimis

and read no further, and hast to the launching forth of
my Dialogue.</p>
