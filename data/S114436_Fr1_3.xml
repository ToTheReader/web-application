   <head>THE ANSWERE TO THE LIBELLERS</head>
   <head type="sub"> Introduction.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>ITremaineth now, that in few words an answer be made to the preamble to the Libell, which consisteth of two parts: the extenuation of the defender, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of the detector.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>For the first:</hi> 1. <hi>Though the defender take not vpon him to be a principall dealer in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, nor to be a professed challenger, as the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler boldly aduentureth: but doth confesse with</hi> Augustine: Absit vt mihi apud catholicos<note place="margin">Cont. Iulian. libr. 6. c. 4.</note> arrogem, quod tibi (apud pontificios) arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re non pudet: vnus sum è multis qui profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas vestras nouitates vt possumus refutamus, &amp;c. <hi>Farre be it from me, to arrogate that to my selfe among Catholikes, which you are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to challenge (among Papists) I am one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many that doe refute, as wee may, your prophane nouelties, as God hath giuen to euery of vs the measure of faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2. <hi>Yet he maketh no doubt to encounter with this chalenger, and is assured he is able to defend, whatsoeuer by him can be impugned: neither doth he shew himselfe such a terrible hackster, but that a</hi> Protestant pygmie, <hi>as he scornefully calleth him, at any time dare grapple with this</hi> Popish pusio: <hi>who euery where bewrayeth his</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
      <hi>ignorance: being neither seene in histories; for then he would not haue denied, that</hi> Leo 3. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the bloud at Mantua to be the bloud of Christ, pag.</hi> 131. <hi>reported by</hi> Platina: <hi>nor yet haue called that a fable, of the childrens heads found in</hi> Gregories <hi>mote, p.</hi> 160. <hi>which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Epistle of</hi> Huldericus <hi>Bishop of Augusta to Pope</hi> Nicholas: <hi>neither would he haue made doubt of that which is alleaged out of Master</hi> Fox, <hi>concerning</hi> Luthers <hi>opinion of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, pag.</hi> 166. <hi>As the Libeller is ignorant in histories, so neither doth he seeme to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the Fathers: for then he would not haue doubted of</hi> Augustines <hi>opinion concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes had in</hi> Iohns <hi>baptisme, p.</hi> 183. <hi>or of</hi> Origens <hi>concerning</hi> Limbus Patrum, <hi>pag.</hi> 185.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And as he is neither</hi> historian, <hi>nor read in the Fathers, so he seemeth to be no very good</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian: <hi>euery where writing</hi> Tetrastilon, <hi>for</hi> Tetrastylon, <hi>and in one place</hi> Apocalipse, <hi>for</hi> Apocalypse, <hi>pag.</hi> 130. <hi>lin.</hi> 14. <hi>and here, where he would seeme to be most eloquent, he writeth</hi> pigmie <hi>for</hi> pygmie, <hi>pag.</hi> 118. <hi>lin.</hi> 20. <hi>Like as another bragger one</hi> Tannerus <hi>a Iesuite in a disputation held at Ratisbone, this yeere</hi> 1602. <hi>for</hi>

   <p>3. <hi>As for</hi> rauening wolues in sheepes cloathing, <hi>and your</hi> fardle of fables: <hi>your selues are the men, that are best knowne by this cognisance: such as the Apostle describeth:</hi> that make a shew of godlines, and denie the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereof, &amp;c. <hi>which</hi> creepe into houses, and leade captiue simple women laden with sinne, 2.

And</hi> Origen <hi>speaketh of such:</hi> Multi sunt, qui nomen Christi habent,<note place="margin">Hom. 3. in Leuitic.</note> sed veritatem non habent Christi: <hi>There are many which haue the name of Christ, but the truth of Christ they haue not. True it is, that when you speake of hypocrisie, and following of fables, you speake of your owne: as</hi> Chrysippus <hi>said of one that railed vpon him:</hi> Thou hast done well, leauing out nothing, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">

      <hi>And as</hi> Hierome <hi>saith:</hi> Peccare est hominis, insidias tendere diaboli: <hi>It is of man to sinne, but to lay waite, is of the diuell. And it is your owne tongue that is the flashing</hi> firebox: <hi>as the Wiseman saith,</hi> He that faineth himselfe mad, casteth firebrands, arrowes and mortall things, Prou. 26. 18. <hi>You as</hi> Hierome <hi>saith:</hi> Flammas ore conceptas tenere non potes, vt<note place="margin">Apolog. 3. aduers.

      <hi>It may seeme strange, that you dare obiect co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning▪ and cunnicatching trickes, pag.</hi> 251. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so full of them your selues.

      <hi>hundred images of</hi> Demetrius Phalereus, <hi>not one remained,</hi> but all while he liued, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: <hi>so all these monuments of the Libellers follie, shall quickly (I trust) in his sight be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and cast downe. And as</hi> Demosthenes <hi>was wont to say of</hi> Phocion, <hi>when hee began to</hi>

      <hi>speake:</hi> Now riseth the hatchet or cutting knife of my sayings: <hi>such shall our true defence be to his false detection.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly,</hi> to answere in a word to his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of disputation and conference: that the defender should hold his hands from pen and paper, and come to trie the quarrell in the presence of her Maiesties most honorable Councell, with that fauour which the French Protestants obtayned before the French King, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>1. <hi>I doe not marueile, if the Libeller be loath</hi>
      <pb facs="16"/>
      <hi>to haue his obiections examined by writing: for he feareth least the light should discouer his iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: as</hi> Demosthenes <hi>answered one suspected of theft, that found fault with his night studies:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> I knew well it grieueth you, that I burne light. <hi>And as a certaine vnskilfull Painter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made an euill fauoured picture of a Cocke,</hi> bid the boy driue away the true Cocks, <hi>that</hi>

      <hi>his vnskilfulnes might not appeare: So playeth this bungler, he would haue no other writing set by his, that his bold ignorance be not descried.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2. <hi>As for triall of the quarrell before the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lords, as I willingly embrace the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers challenge, and am readie to take vp his gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, if it shall so seeme good to their Honors: So in the meane time I send him this Newyeeres gift: &amp; say no more, then</hi> Archidamas <hi>to the Ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>Let him put his hand to his penne, I prouoke him to his booke, let vs conferre by writing, that the reader by himself may iudge of vs: when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to write, and setteth foote to foote, then he will sweate and sticke fast, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>3. <hi>Because our aduersaries doe make great brags, and pretend a desire, that a free disputation and conferēce may be had, I will briefly shew, that they intend nothing lesse, then to haue the trueth decided by a sober and indifferent conference, but onely to shew their wrangling spirits and froward nature, as may appeare by experience alreadie had of their attempts on that behalfe. First, in the disputation held at Westminster in the beginning of her Maiesties raigne, the popish disputers did behaue themselues very frowardly:</hi> 1. <hi>Where</hi>
      <note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of Popish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters.</note>
      <hi>they were appointed to deliuer their minds in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they contrariwise appointed one to repeate their minde in speech.</hi> 2. <hi>When he had finished, they were asked if they had any more to say, and they answered no: yet afterward when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants had propounded their writing, they said they had much more to say.</hi> 3. <hi>Vpon the second day, whereas they were appointed to conferre of the second question, the popish Bishops stood vpon it, that they would first tender their minde in the first question.</hi> 4. <hi>They alleaged that they were commaunded to prouide their writing in Latin, whereas neuer any other order was taken, but that they should write in English.</hi> 5. <hi>Whereas</hi>
      <pb facs="17"/>
      <hi>they were appointed to begin, they utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and so through their wilfulnes the disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brake off. See the report hereof penned by Master</hi> Fox. <hi>pag.</hi> 2119.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Of the like cariage were certaine Iesuites,</hi> Hungerus, Gretserus, Tannerus, <hi>that disputed at Ratisbone this last yeer</hi> 1602. <hi>with</hi> Hunnius, Helbronnerus, <hi>with other Ministers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine confession:</hi> 1. <hi>They before they would dispute, would haue the Ministers to proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be of the Church, and that they had the spirit of God.</hi> 2. <hi>They propounded a question impertinent concerning</hi> Vbiquitie. 3. <hi>In their disputation</hi> Tannerus, <hi>with histrionicall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, lowd outcries, scurrilous scornings, and unseemely gibings,</hi> pudoris claustra perrupit, <hi>became impudent, as the reporter writeth.</hi> 4. <hi>Whē he could not answere, he said nothing, but</hi> nego consequentiam, nego consequentiam, <hi>I denie the consequence, I denie the consequence.</hi> 5. Plus centies clamatum, respondeatur in forma: <hi>Aboue an hundred times they cried out, answere in forme. 6. They refused to dispute in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tongue. 7. When the Scriptures were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, they answered</hi> nihil ad rem, <hi>nothing to the purpose:</hi> ex Egidio Hunnio. <hi>Before this a conference was appointed at</hi> Wormes, <hi>where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Protestants would haue the Scripture to be the iudge of controuersies; the Colloquie was broken off. In like manner the Colloquies at</hi> Aldenburge, Mompelgard, Baden, <hi>by like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>

      <hi>were without fruite:</hi> ibid. <hi>And here</hi> (<hi>I thinke</hi>) <hi>I see the old peruerse Donatists come foorth againe vpon the stage, who in like manner behaued themselues in the Collatiō with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops.</hi> 1. <hi>Where it was agreed that eighteene onely of each side should come to the conference, the Donatists would haue all of their side admitted, which were all assembled to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aged men that could not come.</hi> 2. <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, that the day prescribed for the conference was past, and would haue had the Catholikes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against by default, where they were not faultie at all.</hi> 3. <hi>They required the presence of</hi>
      <note place="margin">Collat. 1. diei ex Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin. bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicul. col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note>
      <hi>all the Catholikes that had subscribed, least any might be rehearsed that were not Bishops: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they had foisted in ones name, whom they (to make a cleanly excuse) affirmed to be dead in the way.</hi> 4. <hi>Whereas the Catholikes said they had</hi> 120. <hi>Bishops more at home, the Donatists affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the same for themselues, whereas they had said before, they were all come to the very aged men.</hi> 5. <hi>They desire a respite of sixe daies, which</hi>
      <note place="margin">Collat. 2. diei.</note>
      <hi>was granted them. 6. They contend,</hi> quinam erant petitores collationis, <hi>which of them were the first mouers and crauers of that collation. 7. The Donatists striue for the name</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. 8. <hi>They obiect that the Catholikes did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> alienam causam, <hi>a cause not belonging to</hi>
      <note place="margin">Collat. 3. diei.</note>
      <hi>them. 9. When the Catholikes began to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their matter, the Donatists with noise inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them, and would not suffer them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,</hi>
      <pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>and hardly could the President of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> Marcellinus <hi>obtaine their silence and patience.</hi> 10. <hi>When as they were bid to sit, they wilfully refused, saying,</hi> It is written, I will not sit in the assemblie of the wicked. 11. <hi>When the Critensian Councell was alleaged, they tooke exception against it that it had</hi> consulem &amp; diem, <hi>the Consul and the day, otherwise then ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall decrees haue, which was vntrue, as the Catholikes shew both by the ancient prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that bare date of the yeere, and the Councell of Melchiades.</hi> 12. <hi>They take exception, that</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. post. collation.</note>
      <hi>sentence was giuen against them in the night. And by these and such other friuolous allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that Collation was made frustrate.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now because he maketh mention of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour which the French Protestants obtained with the King for a conference: I will briefly also shew, what manner of fauour it was, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different the proceeding there vsed. First, the Lord of</hi> Plessis <hi>desired, that whereas the Bishop of</hi> Eureux <hi>pretended diuers authors to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in his booke against the Masse, that his whole booke might be examined, which could not be granted. Secondly, whereas the Bishop had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken exception to 500. places,</hi> Plessis <hi>required, that the rest might be held as iustifiable, which neither was yeelded vnto. Thirdly, that the Bishop should propound those</hi> 500. <hi>places to the Lord</hi> Plessis, <hi>that he might make satisfaction: but neither could this be obtained, pag.</hi> 8. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
      <pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>the Bishop would haue</hi> Plessis <hi>proceeded against</hi>
      <note place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the B. of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux, and the Lord of Plessis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the French King.</note>
      <hi>for default of appearance, being vncalled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded, pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Fiftly, he is denied his action of slaunder against the Bishop, if he could not proue the</hi> 500. <hi>places pretended to be corrupted. Sixtly, the issue is this,</hi> Plessis <hi>must presently without further warning make satisfaction vpon the opening of the booke, or els it should be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his absence, pag.</hi> 11. <hi>and so about two of the clocke in the night the Bishop sent him</hi> 60. <hi>places, to the which he should make satisfaction the next day at eight of the clocke. So these</hi> 500. <hi>places were brought to</hi> 60. <hi>but only nine of them were discussed: in some of them the iudges suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in some they gaue sentence with</hi> Plessis, <hi>in some they were importuned by the Bishop to giue their verdict: in the rest they shewed too much partialitie in iudging otherwise then there was cause. The report of this conference is extant, translated out of French. Now all men may see, that these popish challengers stand altogether vpon aduantages, and call for a disputation, not because they are able to say more then their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or can expect any better successe, but to set a good face vpon the matter, that they should not seeme to say nothing. A wrangler cannot want words: and they care not, as</hi> Ambrose <hi>saith,</hi> Vt intus in animo perdat, foris victor abscedat: <hi>Though they lose a good conscience within, so they may get the victorie without. And such are their disputations, as</hi> Hierome <hi>saith of</hi>

   <p>4. <hi>It grieueth you, that I call the popish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō the</hi> owle-light <hi>of Rome, which</hi> alwaies <hi>hath been taught</hi> (you say) in a visible Church. <hi>I thinke the comparison is fit enough, seeing you refuse the light, as all euill doers hate it,</hi> Ioh. 3. v. 20. <hi>and will not be tried by the Scriptures: as some of your crue in a late colloquie, when it was alleaged, that</hi> Scriptura est norma fidei, <hi>The</hi>

This is the cause why you enuie parishes that benefit which they reape by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their pastors, whereby you want that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, which you desire, to seduce the people: for as</hi> Hierome <hi>saith:</hi> Statim vt oues suas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere velle de proprio grege viderit, diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus fremit, irascitur, furit, perire sibi existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, quicquid Christo seruatur: <hi>The diuell as soone as he seeth, that his sheepe will goe from him, he fretteth, rageth, thinking it a losse to him that is gained to Christ.</hi>
