   <head>A Caueat to the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>THE masked <hi>Jesuite</hi> in his Preface to the Reader,<note place="margin">Preface, pag. 15.</note> laboureth with might and maine to perswade his Readers, that I dare not performe that challenge, which I made to the <hi>Fore-runner</hi>: his wordes are these. <hi>I the meanest of many millions, doe accept of his Challenge, and doe vndertake to defend, not onely these two poynes of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Doctrine, and Pope <hi>Martins</hi> Dispensation, which he hath singled out as matters important; but also all the rest, so it may be with that equitie and fauour, which was graunted to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
      </hi>:<note place="margin">Chalenges doe occupie no place: they are adiectiues, which can not stand without subiectes.</note>
      <hi>And vpon the same conditions doe prouoke him with a counter-challenge, to the defence of his Bookes.</hi> And a litle after, he telleth his Reader, <hi>That hee sendes me as many Challenges, as will stand betweene <hi>Charing-crosse</hi> &amp; <hi>Chester</hi>; and as many Dares, as will reach from <hi>Darby</hi> to <hi>Darington.</hi>
      </hi> To which I answere in this manner. First, that the <hi>Jesuites</hi> are accused and charged by their deare Breathren the popish Secular Priestes, with Pride, Ambition, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, Coozenage, Theft, Crueltie, Murther, Treason, and all wickednesse that can be named: Yea, of Fryer <hi>Parsons</hi> that trayterous <hi>Iesuite,</hi> they giue this testimonie in particular; <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Parsons</hi> platformes, Secular Priestes must depend vpon <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and <hi>Blackwell</hi> vpon <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> vpon <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Parsons</hi> the Priestes Bastard vpon the Deuill. Peruse my <hi>Anatomy of popish Tyrannie,</hi> and there thou shalt finde this trueth, with great varietie of like matter. Secondly, that in all my Challenges, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but one onely Condition; which the <hi>Iesuite</hi> passeth ouer in silence, because he meaneth not to performe the same: The Condition is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Iesuite</hi> which
<pb n="418" facs="226"/>
shall accept the Challenge,<note place="margin">The Author still so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth that he will performe his promise.</note> must put downe his name with his addition in print, and send it to me. Which if it be once performed during my life, I promised vpon my saluation, to doe what in me lyeth, to procure a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for the safe comming, safe abyding, and safe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of him (whosoeuer he be) that shall accept and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the true performance of the Challenge in maner aforesayd. Thirdly, that the <hi>Jesuite</hi> not daring indeed to accept the Challenge, and to encounter me, seeketh by fond cauils and shamelesse euasions, to instill into the eares and heartes of their silly deuoted Vassals, that I will not, because I dare not, performe my promise. And for the better effecting of their purpose, they require of me, that which I neuer promised; yea, that whereof my selfe am altogeather ignoraunt, and no way able to performe. For,<note place="margin">The Iesuite dareth not dispute, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth new conditions.</note> how can I performe that, which I doe not know? I must forsooth procure him a safe conduct, to dispute with that equitie and fauour, which was graunted to the <hi>Protestantes</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Marke for Christes sake, how feard our <hi>Iesuite</hi> is, to accept the Challenge. First, hee dareth not put downe in print, his name and addition: A tricke of Iesuiticall or rather Diabolicall pollicie. I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a safe conduct for <hi>B. C.</hi> Some bloody cut-throate I thinke hee be. Yet I must not know whether hee be a Man or a Monster; whether <hi>Pope Iohn</hi> the Woman, or some Deuill incarnate of a Popish <hi>Nunne.</hi> Besides this; I must accept of such slye conditions, as he addeth to my Challenge; so as he may be at libertie, to slippe the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when, and as he list: Whereby, who seeth not, that by all meanes he auoydeth to dispute or bicker with mee. Fourthly, that the <hi>Iesuite</hi> and his <hi>Jesuited</hi> complices, haue a long time intended, and still labour by vngodly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes, to take away my life from me; and so to stoppe me from further writing against their rotten Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.<note place="margin">Preface, pag. 18.</note> Yea, in his Preface he protesteth lustily, that hee hath prouided a Winding-sheete for the shrowding of
<pb n="419" facs="226"/>
my Carcase; and that he will with all speed, make ready my blacke Funerall. And it seemeth so in very deed: For vpon the 13. of Iune instant 1609. euen immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had finished this <hi>Catholique Triumph</hi>; there came a friendly Letter (but without name) vnto my handes, and a Packet with Siluer in it, which the man namelesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he had borrowed of me, &amp;c. The circumstaunces were such, (<hi>quae nunc non est narrandi locus,</hi>) that neither my selfe, nor others, durst open the Packet; as hauing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant inducementes to suspect Poyson, Pestilence, or other like infection Diabolicall.</p>
   <p>Thus much I thought good in briefe to insinuate to the Readers; that they may thereby see and perceiue, how vnable the Papistes are, to defende their late vpstart Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie: as who know no better meanes, but by seeking most cruelly to murder all such as stand in their way. God make me firme and constant in the trueth; and God defend me, and all professors of his holy trueth, from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sauage crueltie: and in the end, bring vs to endlesse felicitie, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
