   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
Reader: grace in Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE apostle S. Paule (good christian
reader) preaching on a time at<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 19. 18. 19</note> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
against their grosse idolatrie, and
therein also verie mightilie preuailing:
it fell forth that one<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 19. 18. 19</note> Demetrius a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-smith,
and other the craftsmen confederat vvith
him, perceiuing (as they thought) their profits vvould
verie shrevvdlie abate, if (by the preaching of Paule)
their great goddesse Diana should grovv in contempt,
they therefore<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 19. 27.</note> (pretending the onelie defense of their
state and religion) procured foorthvvith<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 19. 29. 34</note> a vvoonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tumult throughout the citie, vvhereby the dealings
of Paule &amp; his companie vvere causleslie called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
For the sequell shevves it selfe, that the preaching
of Paule, tended neither to the dispraise of their art, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet to the ouerthrovv of religion: notvvithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Demetrius and his companie<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 19. 27.</note> pretended both: No,
he onelie reprooued that superstitious abuse of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie:
and labored to bring them vvithall vnto the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
religion in deed.</p>
   <p>So surelie, my selfe (on a sabboth daye) preaching
not long since at a certeine faire againste those sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
abuses vvhich the common sort of chapmen doo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suallie
practise in their buieng and selling: verie manie
of them vvere meruellouslie offended therevvith, as
though I had (vvith the anabaptisticall heretiks) euen
vtterlie condemned the verie facultie it selfe, or had
beene some professed enimie vnto the religion of Christ.
ƲƲheras the sequell shevves (you may see) hovv that
both I indeuored to reuiue the ancient integritie of bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and selling (the same being novv a daies, verie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouslie
ouerspred vvith the contagious infection of
beastlie abuses) and that I labored vvithall to mainteine
<pb facs="6"/>
the sincere religion of Christ, vvhich (by meanes of those
beastlie abuses) began novv (in a maner) to be generallie
despised, as a religion tending onelie to a verie licencious
and carnall libertie. But as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the rest of
that couetous crevv (hovvsoeuer they pretended the
publike state &amp; religion) vvold neuer haue so vvinched
at the preaching of Paul, if so be their vnlavvful commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
themselues had not (by circumstance thereof) bin
called in question: so surelie it is to be thought, that those
fellovves vvhich frovvned so furiouslie against that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of mine (vvhatsoeuer they outvvardlie pretended)
vvould neuer haue kicked thereat as they did, had not
some other secret and inordinat affections of theirs (by
such a maner of preaching) beene verie shreudlie spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galled.
Hovvbeit, I (for mine ovvne part) doo not yet
certeinelie knovv the cheefe cause in deed of this their
sudden conceiued choler against me: and therefore dare
not certeinelie set dovvne the same. For, vvhether it
vvas because (in their ovvn consciences) they felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
verie roundlie rubd on the gall, or vvhether it
vvas for that they doubted their great goddesse Diana
(I meane that dissimulation of theirs,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 24</note> vvhich brought
before such gaine to their arts) being thus plainelie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied,
vvould novv be easilie espied euen of the simpler
sort,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 27.</note> and so, by consequence, the reproouing thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the more dangerous to that their estate: verie
sure I am they had no iust cause at all to be greeued
therevvith. VVell, vvhether it vvas the spirit or spite,
or vvhatsoeuer accident else that disquieted their splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
passion: the issue (you may see) dooth turne to the
glorie of God.<note place="margin">Ierem. 23.</note> For heereby appeareth the povver of his
vvord, vvhich as a hammer, is able to breake vnto
povvder, such hardened hearts as hearten themselues
against the orderlie course thereof. And novv being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
persuaded by some, that the publishing thereof in
<pb facs="6"/>
Print vvould greatlie grovv to thy good: I could not
vvith anie reason at all dissent from that their earnest
desire. For although it should vvorke none amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all in the minds of miserable catifs, vvho (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too too far muzled vvith the contagious practise of
such cankred abuses) cannot, by anie possible meanes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
themselues from the custome thereof: yet may it
fullie suffice, both to display their deuises, and to make
thee the more throughlie acquainted vvith some knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those their deceits vvherevvith I vvas deeplie
deceiued my selfe. Neither could I at anie hand finde
out their footings, vntill by dailie experience, the schoole-mistresse
of fooles, I espied their pranks, and paid for my
knovvledge.</p>
   <p>The principall cause vvhich draue me to dispose the
matter dialog vvise, vvas therby to let thee vnderstand,
both vvhat they vvere able to say for themselues: &amp; to
shevv thee vvithall, hovv to ansvver the same. So that
thou nedest not novv no more be deceiued by anie their
subtle deuises: vnlesse thou purposelie suffer thine eies to
be blindfolded by such pratling dissemblers as purpose
to play vvith thy pursse.</p>
   <p>The speakers produced in this present treatise are
principallie foure, presenting vnto thee foure seuerall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of people. The <hi>Ingroser</hi> he comprehends our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
merchants. The <hi>Pedler</hi> dooth signifie the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
sort of buiers and sellers. <hi>No-bodie</hi> stands for the
state of our painfullest preachers. And <hi>Euerie-bodie</hi>
puts vpon him the person of the comminaltie. Novv
because the best preachers of all are (in these daies) not
onelie of no account vvith the vvicked, but oft times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vniustlie accused of all men: I haue therefore thus
intituled this treatise: <hi>NO-BODIE is my name,
bearing EVERIE-BODIES blame:</hi> vvhich
thing the verie sequell it selfe dooth fullie confirme.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Moreouer, because those particular reprehensions
vvhich the godlie preachers (vppon iust occasion) doe
practize, can hardlie haue passage among the most of our
English professours: I do therefore purposlie debate that
one speciall point, or euer I proceede to the principall, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
Lastlie, at the knitting vp of this treatise, I haue
promised to deale (in like sort) against the hard dealings
of such as are to fraught the <hi>Markets</hi> vvith graine and
victuals: the vvhich (by Gods grace) I meane to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme,
the rather if I perceiue these nevvlie attempted
traueiles may obtaine anie good liking at the handes of
the godlie, for vvose sake I aduentured the publishing
thereof. In the meane time (good christian reader) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all those in thy praiers to God: vvho haue
euen vovved themselues to vndertake anie
paines for the profit of his church.
