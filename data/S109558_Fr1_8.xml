                 <title>The three orations of Demosthenes chiefe orator among the Grecians, in fauour of the Olynthians, a people in Thracia, now called Romania : with those his fower orations titled expressely &amp; by name against king Philip of Macedonie: most nedefull to be redde in these daungerous dayes, of all them that loue their countries libertie, and desire to take warning for their better auayle, by example of others. Englished out of the Greeke by Thomas Wylson doctor of the ciuill lawes. After these orations ended, Demosthenes lyfe is set foorth, and gathered out of Plutarch, Lucian, Suidas, and others, with a large table, declaring all the principall matters conteyned in euerye part of this booke.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey are thought euer in the opinion of wisemen to bee the worthiest of all others, and to deserue the greatest estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that seeke always to kepe companie with the best sorte that bee. For that such euerye one is most lyke to be himselfe as the company is with whom he matcheth. And as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, so it is in the course that anye man taketh for his studie. They that doe acquaint themselues with the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the best and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wryters, are lyke in tyme to resemble in some sorte their value and worthynesse, yea, according to that saying of Tullie, he that goeth much in the sunne, shall be sunne burnte though he thinke not of it. And as Aelianus sayth, he that kepeth company with Callias that iolly potte companion, shall be a lusty drinker as he was: if with Ismenias, he shall be a trimme Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strell: if with Alcibiades, he shall be prowde and loftie: if with Corby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, he shall be a good Cooke, and learne to dresse meate well: if anye gyue himselfe to followe Demosthenes, he shall growe eloquent and wise: if he seeke after Epaminundas, he shall be a lustie warrier: if he lyke A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesilaus, he shall be a stoute man, and of great courage: if he follow Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, he shall be a good man: if he loue Aristides, hee shall bee a iust man: if he followe Socrates, he shall be a wise man. And lykewyse De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes himselfe in that his Oration De falsa legatione agaynst Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, declareth Euripides verses as a testimonye and witnesse of Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines lewde lyfe, who kept company with Philocrates, and such other lewde lyuers.

      </q>
And thus I begyn after a sort to chalenge prayse to my selfe, euen at the very first chop on Gods name: for that I haue thus trauayled &amp; bene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted wyth this famous Orator. But how I haue profited I know not, nor yet if I knewe, would I make any great bragge of it. Thus much I thynke I may boldly say, it is no small happe for any man to hit
<pb facs="9"/>
vpon the best, euen at the verie first beginning. As for prayse (as I sayd) I doe not looke for any, much lesse do I desire it, and what good I haue done to my selfe, that wyll appeare hereafter: Once vertue is contented with hir owne selfe, as y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which is of hir owne nature ful sufficiency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neede of outward ayde or borrowed fauour. And therfore he that doth well, and profiteth in vertue &amp; learning, nedeth not much to long after the good liking or allowance of others. For glory and welfare do as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow well doings, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> shadow followeth the bodie: as the which are in all ages the necessarie rewards of vertue. I do not disprayse any mans trade of lyfe eyther of elder tyme, or of later yeares: but I doe preferre in all faculties some certaine before others. As in Cosmographie Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus: in Arithmeticke our Tonstale, and Tartalio the Italian: in Geometrie Euclides, in Astronomye Aratus, in Philosophie Aristotel and Plato, in Phisick Hippocrates &amp; Galenus, in law Iustinian y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or rather Trebonianus &amp; others that gathered the lawes: in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories Titus Liuius and Cesar for the Latine, Thucidides and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus as Quintilian sayth, wyth certayne others for the Greeke: in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Demosthenes and Cicero, the one for the Greeke, and the other for the Latine. And hee that in all these faculties doth chieflye and aboue all others, followe these aboue named: he taketh the best way that maye bee in my mynde to doe himselfe the most good. For what is he that ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into any facultie would not desire (if he myght) to excell all others? And who can euer come to any such excellencye that doth not acquaynte himselfe first wyth the best, yea and seeketh to followe the chiefest that haue traueyled in those thinges, the perfection whereof hee wysheth to gette? So did Plato traueyle from Greece into Aegypt: Aristotell from Stagira in Macedonie, to Athens in Greece, to heare his maister Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and Cicero from Rome to Athens, and Anacharsis that barbarous Scithian to talke with Solon that wyse law maker of Athens, seeking euerye one of them the best abrode, when they coulde not haue them at home. Neither doe I repent me to haue traueylde in this wryter amongst others, who for excellencie passeth all others, and the more that he is stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed, the better he is lyked. For that there are hydde in him many secrete ornamentes, the which at the very first, doe not appeare, and are hardly to be vttered by me I confesse, in our Englysh tongue. Quintilian doth so set foorth this wryter, that he gyueth him the prayse aboue all others, specially for the graue and pithye handlyng of his matters much better than any man else. And therefore in comparing Cicero and Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes togither, hee sayth that it needeth not so to doe, for that they were both most excellent men. And yet he wylleth that Demosthenes shoulde chiefly be read, naye rather to be cunde without booke, worde by worde of euery body. And concluding after a certayne comparison made of them both, sayth that Demosthenes beyng the elder, hath made Tullie to bee for the most part such a one altogither as he was. Then what should let but that all those who desire to be eloquent men (the chiefest ornament that can be giuen to man vpon earth) shoulde chieflye studie Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and followe hym by all meanes possible, seeyng Cicero attayned to
<pb facs="9"/>
such eloquence vp the onely imitation of so famous an Orator? Now they that wyll be such <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> as he was, must doe as he did, that is, they must not spare any labor, but be alwayes occupied, and chiefly follow this mans profession, whose watchinges and paynes taking weare notable, as may appeare by the report made in his lyfe. Yea hee was so full set to atteine vnto the excellency of eloquence, that being vnapt &amp; vntoward by nature through many his great impediments: he warred as it should seeme with Nature, &amp; conquered Nature also, with very great paynes takyng, and continual wrastling for the victory. Neyther could any else that haue bene naturally apt, and had no let at all to be excellent Orators, euer be able to exceede Demosthenes, notwythstandyng all the barres and hinderances, that by Natures iniurie happened vnto him. Besides this, (as I haue sayde elsewhere) he was temperate of hys diet and kept his health, and encreased hys witte with sobrietie, and moderate vsage of him selfe at all tymes: a thing most requisite for any one that myndes to compasse great matters vpon earth. And where as all men of any vnderstanding seeke to follow some one, vnto whom they desire to be lyke, or if it may be, to passe him (the readiest way no doubt, for any one, to waxe most excellent) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes did imitate and follow first Plato, and after Thucidides hys Countriemen both, the one a Philosopher, the other a Chronicler of the warres betwixt Athens &amp; Peloponnesus. And so well did he like Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides that manye times he did borrowe whole sentences of him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his very first sentence of the first Oration in fauour of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthians, the which sentence and diuers other sentences hee tooke out of Thucidides first Oration made in fauour of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Corcereans now Corfu, &amp; out of the next Oration made by the Corinthians against the said Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereans. Yea, it doth appeare that he did borow his chiefe arguments and best reasons that he vseth, out of this mans Orations: &amp; that he did as it should seeme, imitate wholy Thucidides inuention. Wherevnto agreeth Vlpianus, who affirmeth that Demosthenes chiefe desire was, to haue Thucidides veyne and gift of writyng in all thinges. And in deede such was Demosthenes diligence and painfulnesse about this Author that he did wryte out with his owne hande, the whole hystorie of Thucidides (being a booke fully so bigge as all the newe Testament is) no lesse than eyght seuerall tymes. A trauayle certes right painefull, and yet the paynes very well bestowed, when so good fruite did followe therevpon. For no doubt Demosthenes by suche imitation and paynefull labor, came to that heigth of perfection, whereof he beareth the name, that is, to bee the chiefe Orator of all Greecelande, yea of all the worlde besides, I may well say. For in three or fower poyntes vnited in him togither, without doubt he passed greatly all others, that euer weare. First he had a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iudgement to deuyse good matter, and to dispose the same most aptly, as tyme and place required: Agayne, he had the stomacke of a Lion, to speake boldly although not to fight manfully, and did vtter his meaning with such myght and grauitie, that he appalled greatly the courages of all others whatsoeuer: Thirdly his vtterance was so good (beyng made so by Arte, euen agaynst Nature) that neuer anye hath had better, eyther
<pb facs="10"/>
since or before. Lastly, he is to be praysed for that, which passeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gyftes, that is, he was a very honest man, a iust dealer, a true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect alwayes to his countrie. And therefore although in some one of these gyftes, he myght perhaps be matched: yet was there neuer anye compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him for them all togyther. And of these his doynges the world is so true a iudge, that I neede not much to spende anye farther talke, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some will saye, that Tullie is to bee compared with hym in all things. Of the which two men if I shoulde saye my mynde flatly, there be perhaps that would byte the lippe at it, and count mee fonde in myne enterprise. And yet thus much I may boldly say, that Demosthenes hath more matter couched in a small roume, than Tullie hath in a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, &amp; that Demosthenes writing is more binding, more fast, firme, and more agreable to our common maner of speach, than Tullies Orations are. And who so speaketh now as Demosthenes doth, I doe thynke hee should be counted the wiser, the more temperate, and the more graue man a great deale, than if he wholy followed Tullie, and vsed his large veyne and vehement maner of eloquence. Besides this, Demosthenes vsed a playne familier maner of writing and speakyng in all his actions, applying hymselfe to the peoples nature and to their vnderstanding without vsing of Proheme, to wynne credite, or deuysing conclusion to moue affections and to purchase fauor after he had done hys matter: whereas Tullie with his flowing eloquence, sought to wrest the iudges to hys purpose both at the beginning, in the middle, &amp; at the end, not trusting as it shou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d seeme to the goodnesse of his cause, or to speake more modestly it was sufferable in Rome, to vse these practises of eloquence, both in the beginning &amp; ending of their orations to aduance their matters withall, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same being vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde in Greecelande, vpon paine of displeasure. And were it not better &amp; more wisedome to speake plainly &amp; nakedly after the common sort of men in few words, than to ouerflowe wyth vnnecessarie and superfluous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as Cicero is thought sometimes to doe? But perhaps wheras I haue bene somewhat curious to followe Demosthenes naturall phrase, it may be thought that I doe speake ouer bare Englysh. Well I had rather follow his veyne, the whych was to speake simply and plainly to the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples vnderstanding, than to ouerflouryshe wyth superfluous speach, although I might therby be counted equall with the best that euer wrate Englysh. For Demosthenes speaketh alwayes matter &amp; hath such force in hys maner of wryting, as no man hitherto hath euer bene able to expresse, and all men haue styll had hym in moste hygh admiration for the same. But why doe I compare these two noble vertues togyther? makyng the one better than the other, whereas they weare both most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Orators, and chiefe ornamentes of eyther their owne countries in their dayes: both of them a rare example of nature, and such as none in anye age, hath bene lyke for excellencie, to eyther of them. Then what needes such comparisons, when both are equally chiefe in their kynde? as Quintilian hath very well declared, in rehearsing their vertues seuerally, and in lapping vp his matter, sayth in thys wise, that vnto Tullie nothing can be added, and from Demosthenes nothyng can be taken away wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="10"/>
harme doyng to eyther of them. And therefore to returne to Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes, I saye, he is to be read of yong and olde, of learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of wyse, and vnwyse, for that he hath in hym to serue all mens turnes whatsoeuer. He that loues hys countrye, and desires to procure the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it, let him reade Demosthenes, and he shall not want matter to doe hymselfe good. For him that seekes common quietnesse, Demosthenes can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eache hym the lesson: he that woulde gladlye preuent euyll to come, Demosthenes is for his purpose: He that desires to serue hys Countrye abrode, let hym reade Demosthenes day and nyght, for this is he that is able to make hym fitte to doe any seruyce for his Countryes welfare. For neuer dyd glasse so truely represent a mans face, as Demosthenes doth shewe the worlde to vs, and as it was then, so it is now, and wyll be so still, tyll the consummation and ende of all things shall be. The Deuill neuer ceaseth from the beginning of the worlde to make diuision betwixt Countrie and Countrie, to stirre ciuill warre, to enboulden the commons agaynst their superiours, to put euill thoughts into Counsellers heades, to make people ambicious and couetous, and to corrupt the hartes euen of the very messengers and preachers of Gods word, continuing his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse styll in all places wyth all men. And therefore seeyng Demosthenes is so good a Schoolemayster for man to decypher the Deuill and hys ministers for the aduauncement of vpryghtnesse in all thinges: I would wyshe that all men woulde become his Scholers, yea, if it might bee I would that all youth weare first taught Greke, (for so Quintilian would haue it) and that they after some rypenesse in the tongue, and of elder yeares, weare fully acquaynted wyth Demosthenes, to learne hym with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, that they myght perfite their iudgementes by oft readyng so worthy a man. Alexander was angrye wyth a Schoolemayster of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, bicause he did not teache them Homer. I wyll not be angrye wyth Schoolemaysters, but I woulde wyshe that Schollers beyng of rype yeares, and otherwyse trayned before in other Authors: weare taught Demosthenes, and not Homere onelye. Once this is most true, that the wysest man lyuing may learne of Demosthenes, how to benefite hymselfe and to doe good to hys Countrye, and to mayntayne also the safety of it. And a thing I haue to report, the whych almost is scant credible, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a certayne ambassage made. And yet bicause I doe finde it written, I wyll make it knowne farther. Petrus Mosellanus a notable learned Germane, the restorer of good learning about fiftye yeares past, at what tyme he was famous in the Vniuersitie of Lipsia in hygh Almayne, dyd report vnto Christopherus Hegendorphinus a Germayne also, and a man of no lesse worthynesse, not onely for the Greeke, but also for the law whereof he made profession, that Bessario a Grecian borne and Cardinal in the tyme of Eugenius the fourth Pope of that name, and ouerlyuing hym tyll Xistus was Pope in the yeare of our Lorde God. 1484. desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of hys owne accorde to goe as Legate into Fraunce, to appease the great malyce that was then betwixt Lewys the .xj. of Fraunce, &amp; Charles of Burgondie, and to exhort the same Kyng to turne hys warres vppon the Turke. The which Ambassage, as Mosellanus sayth, when he tooke
<pb facs="11"/>
vpon him, he vsed for hys speache to the Frenche King one of the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Demosthenes in Greeke, made agaynst Philip of Macedonye as it laye worde for worde, alteryng verye fewe sentences or none in the discourse of hys whole matter, sauyng that hee applyed that agaynst the Turke, which Demosthenes vsed agaynst King Philip. Whereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that Bessario beyng a notable learned Grecian, did see, not onely a patterne for hymselfe to vse in those dayes, but also a meane to woorke some good reformation by, for thamendement of thinges amysse, and the aduauncement of Gods truth and iustyce. Then how much is this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to bee esteemed, that hauing wrytten almost two thousande yeares past, can haue fresh matter styll, for an Ambassador to doe hys Legacye to a forreyne king, so manye hundreth yeares after. And as thys most learned Ambassador did helpe hymselfe then, to aduaunce the goodnesse of hys matter: so may all others at thys tyme, and hereafter doe the like, and not onely Ambassadors but Counsellers also, may finde great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of matter to doe their country good withall. For as Thucidides sayth, <hi>Tempora adferunt similia exempla donec hic mundus &amp; haec rerum natura manet.</hi> That is to say: like time bringeth forth lyke examples, so long as the world lasteth, &amp; the course of nature continueth. But what doe I in seeking to commende this Orator? I had neede to haue the eloquence of the Orator himselfe, hauyng so large a fielde to walke in. Howbeit, his owne workes, are sufficient ynough to commend themselues, beyng read in his naturall tongue, seeming perhaps but bare as they are now brought into Englyshe. But this I haue done onely to giue occasion to others much better learned than I am, to take this matter vpon them, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing plainlye, that euen in these my small traueyles, both Cambridge and Oxforde men, haue gyuen me their learned aduise, and in some things haue set to their helpyng hande. Thys I speake, bicause I woulde not defraude any of their prayse. And touching Demosthenes worthynesse although I neede not saye anye more: yet wyll I set foorth after thys Prologue, the seuerall reports of diuers learned men, that haue spoken and written in all ages of his prayse, and so leaue the consideration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to others. I, for myne owne doynges must euer make this request, that hauing a good meaning with me, none may blame me for mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, although things doe not so fall out, as I woulde haue them, many may well desire. For Demosthenes is not so easie to bee englyshed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he for all mens vnderstandings and capacities. Thys I thought good to aduertise the gentle Reader: that whereas in the printing of this booke, there is sometimes a sentence, or halfe a sentence in the small Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke letter, the same is not in the Greeke, but added onely, for the more playne vnderstanding of the matter, that such as bee not learned, may the rather go thorow with the reading of these Orations, without any stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at all. Other things that are harde and straunge, for the matter and Countries whereof he speaketh: I haue done myne endeuour to make them easie and better to bee knowne, wyth deuising addicions in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, such as I was best able to frame. Besides this I haue set forth the towne of Athens seuerally, with a certayne declaration or rather limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="11"/>
of Greeceland, and also haue giuen as occasion serued, the names that be vsed at thys tyme, to diuers of their auncient townes. They that like not my labour, may suffer me to abounde wyth mine owne humor, and to serue my fantasie, as I am well contented, that they shall vse their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and satisfie their appetite, as they thinke meete. For so that vertue be aduaunced, no man is to be mislyked, although hee doe but meanely. Neyther is it possible nor yet agreeing wyth nature, that euerye man can excell. But howsoeuer it bee with vs, better or worse, let euerye man haue thys before hys eyes in all his lyfe and doyngs: first to honour God as hee hath willed himselfe to bee honoured: next to loue the naturall Countrie where he is borne, aboue all worldly thyngs: thirdly to obeye the Magistrate that is in authoritie: and last of all, euery one to doe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they woulde haue others, doe to them. And these lessons he that hath them not otherwise, may learne them of Demosthenes well ynough, whom if my Countrie men shall aswell like of, for his good councell, as I haue taken paynes in him for their onely sakes: then haue I the fruite of my traueyle, and wysh them good successe in all their doyngs. 1570.</p>
