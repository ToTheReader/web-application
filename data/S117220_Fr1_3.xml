      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the glory of true vertue to appeare as she is, and to be seene in her owne proper colours: wherein she hath a glorious triumph over vice, which, though audacious and impudent, yet is she ashamed of her owne face, and seekes to cover it with the vaile of vertue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance Idolatry, which puts on the maske of Piety, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of Religion, Hypocrisie of Sincerity, Covetousnesse of Thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, Prodigality of Liberality, Lewd fellowship of Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Hereupon the lewdest companions that can be, such as feare nor God nor man, such as take libertie to all loosenesse and licentiousnesse, committing all manner of sinne with greedinesse, Carders, Dicers, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Swaggerers, Gluttons, Drunkards, and others like them, very beasts in humane shapes, Swine, Dogs, Toads, Aspes, yea Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, take upon them the name of <hi>Good-fellowes,</hi> and entitle their abominable and execrable communion <hi>Good-fellowship.</hi> Herein they have prevailed as farre as Papists in their undue and uniust usurpation of the title <hi>Catholicke:</hi> entituling their Apostaticall and Antichristian Church the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> and to make their blindnesse (or rather madnesse) the more manifest to the whole world, they ioyne these two contradictory titles together, <hi>Romish-Catholick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</hi> Yet herein they have so farre prevailed, as not onely themselves assume, but others also give them that title <hi>Catholicke.</hi> But how? Surely in way of scorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as the Holy Ghost giveth the stile of Gods to Idols. As Papists, so other lewd companions have so farre prevailed by usurping to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this stile <hi>Good-fellowes,</hi> and to their society this title <hi>Good fellowship,</hi> as others also that are not of that fraternity give them and their divelish society this stile and title. Wherefore to pull away these stollen feathers from that blacke crow, that foule crew, this Treatise is penned: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is declared, who are the onely true <hi>Good-fellowes,</hi> and what is the only true <hi>Good-fellowship,</hi> namely the <hi>Saints</hi> and their <hi>Societie.</hi> In handling which point thou hast (good Reader) set before thee as the particulars whereof that <hi>Good-fellowship</hi> consisteth, so the sweetnesse and amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the dignity, and excellency thereof, and many other allurements to draw thee thereto; together with directions how to obtaine a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in that fellowship, and how to carie thy selfe worthy thereof, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable thereto. Be more diligent inviewing and well observing the matter of this Treatise, then in enquiring after the <hi>Author</hi> thereof <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pede
<pb facs="5"/> Herculem.</hi> By this small parcell of his paines, thou maist iudge what the man is. Yea by a studious reading of this Booke thou maist know thy selfe, and understand of what company thou art. Thou maist hereby iudge of companies, and know which is the best. In this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise thou shalt finde that the true <hi>Good-fellowes</hi> here described have a sweet communion one with another, yea and with the Father, and his Sonne. What high prerogatives and excellent priviledges these be, what cordials are thence ministred to poore distressed soules, what thereupon to be avoided, what to be endeavoured after, are distinctly and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly set out in this Discourse. Such apt and iust consequences are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from the principall Points, as most, if not all the heads of our Christian Religion are explaned. Brevity and Perspicuity are here ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. Read, and marke, and thou shalt find such varietie of matter as will minister delight with profit. Thus much I thought good to give thee notice of, not simply to commend the worke, but rather to incite thee to seeke after the treasure which is hid therein, that so thou maist shew thy selfe like the wise Merchant, who having heard of a Pearle of great price, and of a rich treasure, could not be quiet till he had got them, as the Lord noteth among his Parables. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
