      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing this lying by me, vvithout any purpose to publish it as yet, I vvas aduertized of the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay of M.</hi> Penries <hi>book by the Pursiuant. VVhereupon I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (though it should be some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to my friende) not to closet it vp any longer, lest th'aduersary shoulde too much triumph &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult. Euen as it came vnto my hands, so haue I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it his pasport, vvithout any addition or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mine: onely the Title I confesse is mine ovvne, the rest is my Oxford friends, vvho if he be thought in his pleasant veine anye thing too snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, the reader is to vvey vvith vvhat kind of ad uersary he deales: namely, vvith the snappishest gentleman, and most bitter mouthes, that euer put pen to paper. For the rest, it may be I am partial, and therefore I leaue the iudgement to others. The man (it should seeme) had no purpose to stand vpō euery particuler, but rather in a kinde of cursorie deliuery to his friend, but to touch (as it vvere) the general defects &amp; lamenes of M.</hi> Somes <hi>distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered discourse: vvhich yet the reader shall see he hath not done it so slightly neither, but that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and pouertie of most of the aduersaries groundes, may easilie be discried by this, if there vvere no more. Neuertheles, for the better satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of all men, I hope he that hath hitherto vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the cause vvith so happie a hand, vvill not so leaue it if God assist him. I hope I say, not vvith standing the violent &amp; iniurious vvresting of his labours out of his hands, the Lord in his good time vvill bring them forth to the fuller clearing &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyding of the vvhole at large. In the mean vvhile M.</hi> Some <hi>may do vvell, hauing gotten his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries booke (as it is like he hath, if his pen be not stroken vvith a desperate feare) to publishe it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangled as he receiued it, and so to confute it if he can. His aduersarie being so vveake as he takes him to be, he need not to svveate much about it, it vvill be done he knovves, vvith the turning of a hand. And vvhile he is in trauel about such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, there be of his friendes, that vvill be so bolde to pray for him for good-vvill, that God vvoulde vouchsafe him an humble spirite in a thorovve feeling of his ovvne vvants, that hovvsoeuer he be puffed vp othervvise, he may tremble and stoope at the scepter of Iuda, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvare he spurne not against the trueth.</hi>
