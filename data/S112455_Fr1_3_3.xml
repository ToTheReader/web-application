   <l>SO brings the wealth-contracting ieweller</l>
   <l>Pearles and deare stones, from richest shores and streames,</l>

   <l>So doth his hand enchase in ammeld gold,</l>

   <l>In more then golden verse, those better'd spirits;</l>
   <l>So he entreasures Princes cabinets,</l>
   <l>As thy wealth will their wished libraries;</l>
   <l>So, on the throate of the rude sea, he sets</l>
   <l>His ventrous foot, for his illustrous prise:</l>
   <l>And through wild desarts, arm'd with wilder beasts,</l>
   <l>As thou aduentur'st on the multitude,</l>
   <l>Vpon the boggie, and engulfed brests</l>
   <l>Of hyrelings, sworne to find most right, most rude:</l>
   <l>And he, in stormes at sea, doth not endure,</l>
   <l>Nor in vast desarts, amongst wolues, more danger;</l>
   <l>Then we, that would with vertue liue secure,</l>

   <l>Wherein <hi>MINERVA</hi> had beene vanquished,</l>

   <l>And through thy subiect wouen her graphicke thred,</l>
   <l>Contending therein, to be more entranc't;</l>
   <l>For, though thy hand was scarce addrest to draw</l>
   <l>The semi-circle of <hi>SEIANVS</hi> life,</l>
   <l>The <hi>Muse</hi> yet makes it the whole sphaere, and law</l>
   <l>To all State liues: and bounds ambition's strife.</l>
   <l>And as a little brooke creepes from his spring,</l>
   <l>With shallow tremblings, through the lowest vales,</l>
   <l>As if he fear'd his streame abroad to bring,</l>
   <l>Least prophane sect should wrong it, and rude gales;</l>
   <l>But finding happy channels, and supplyes</l>
   <l>Of other foords mixe with his modest course,</l>
   <l>He growes a goodly riuer, and descryes</l>
   <l>The strength, that man'd him, since he left his source;</l>
   <l>Then takes he in delight some meades, and groues,</l>
   <l>And, with his two-edg'd waters, flourishes</l>
   <l>Before great palaces, and all mens loues</l>
   <l>Build by his shores, to greet his passages:</l>
   <l>So thy chaste <hi>Muse</hi>, by vertuous selfe-mistrust,</l>
   <l>Which is a true marke of the truest merit;</l>
