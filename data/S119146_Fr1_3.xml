      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING englished (right honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) this litle short Treatise of the Cawtelles of the moste Blasphemous, Abhominable, and Monstrous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Masse: And hauing withall well weyed and considered that the enemies of the grace of God (the Papistes I meane) both in elder dayes helde, and at this day hold in meruelous great estimation and reuerence the same, as the chiefe ground worke, maine piller, &amp; onely corner stone of their superstitious and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous religion, (if it may be sayd a religion) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention most contrary to the holy institution of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord Iesus Christ, to the great dishonour of
<pb facs="3"/>him &amp; of his Church, still fiercely &amp; bloodely (where they haue dominion &amp; rule) with sword, fire, &amp; fagot mainteining it: I thought it (in my poore opinion) a worke most necessary both for the glory of God, &amp; also for the benefite of the ignoraunter sorte of my countrey men, to send it abroad amongest them, that they might thereby perfectly see &amp; rightly iudge (if they will not continue willfully blind) how grossely both their Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and they them selues also, haue bene by that shorne broode of Antechristian Balamytes, the onely blockish and shameles deuisers of the same horribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused &amp; fondly led. And because (Sir) the booke es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially and chiefly the comment vpon the same is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the publishing: I haue therefore in a Christian boldnes presumed on your honorable curtesie, to offer &amp; present it vnto your wise and graue consideration, as to a moste honourable personage worthy &amp; meete to stand the Patrone &amp; defender of so notable a work, most humbly beseeching you not so much to regard the basenes of the Translation, as the sounde dealing of myne Author in the discouering &amp; confuting of their most monstrous &amp; palpable dolteries.
