<pb facs="3"/> persō or his Office. As the face of <hi>Moses</hi> descending the Mount from God, shone bright and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: so the Maiesticke looke of a King (reflecting diuine beames, receiued from the King of Kings) daunteth the most proud and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge hearts of Inferiors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings are in holy Writ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lights,</hi> for their glory; <hi>Gods</hi> for their power; and the <hi>Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> to testifie their graces, and the dignity of their Office. And surely your Maiesty is a light, and a light of Israel, (Gods people) not onely for glory, but for example of piety, religion, and vertue: your Maiesty is Gods Lieutenant, executing his power, which consisteth chiefly in ordering &amp; directing, in protecting and defending, in rewarding and punishing: in a word, your Maiesty is truely the
<pb facs="3"/> Lords annointed, furnished with all Royall and Princely graces, and namely of a wise and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing heart, to iudge and rule this geat &amp; mighty people, ouer which the Lord hath placed you.</p>
   <p>Wherefore I haue presumed (being but a Translator) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this small Treatise to your Maiesty, not as a thing worthy so iudicious view; but for that it treateth of the Authority of Kings, and for that it was by the Authour dedicated to a King his Maister, entitled <hi>Most Christian;</hi> &amp; therefore for none more meet, thē your Maiesty, being truly stiled <hi>Defender of the fath.</hi> Wherein I beseech your Maiesty to pardon the boldnesse, and passe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of him, that is bound (with all true subiects) vnfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray to the King of Kings, for your Maiesties long and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
<pb facs="4"/> raigne in this world, and an immortall Crowne of eternall felicity in the world to come.</p>
