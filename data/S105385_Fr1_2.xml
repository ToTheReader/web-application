   <head>The Contentes of this <hi>Booke.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>I Haue intituled this Dialogue, the good Householder, or the <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> because I make comparison in the same, of the good and euil householders with the beastes, which knowe best to prouide for their nourishment and conseruation, aswell of them as of their yong.</p>
   <p>And because also that the Philosophers, haue called the knowledge of wel and wise gouerning the houses and families, by the name of <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> and also the bokes which they haue composed and made of such matter: It seemeth to me that this title agreeth very wel to this Dialogue. As touching the principal matters whiche
<pb facs="3"/>
are intreated of in it, first I declare, in what degree of humanitie we may put the wysest men of this worlde, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the true knowledge of God, and without true religion, and which neuerthelesse go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themselues more wisely then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as touching their housholdes and worldly affayres.</p>
   <p>And therefore, I compare the reason and prudence of men, with the same of Beastes, touching their domesticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and chiefely with the same of the <hi>Antes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And prosecuting that matter, I speake of the transformation of <hi>Antes</hi> into men.</p>
   <p>Afterwardes I declare howe <hi>Salomon</hi> doth send vs vnto the schoole of the <hi>Ants, Connies, Grashopers</hi> and <hi>Spyders.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And by that occasion, I speake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of those Beastes, and do declare what thinges we ought to learne of them.</p>
   <p>Item, of the comparison of the workes of those Beastes, and of those of men.</p>
   <p>Of the transformation of <hi>Arachna,</hi> and of <hi>Acteon,</hi> and of the prouidence of God, the whiche manifesteth it selfe in the
<pb facs="3"/>
nature of the brute beastes, and cheefely in those which are the least.</p>
   <p>And because that the cheefest thing that is required in a good housholder, is the amitie and loue of the husbande and the wife, the one towardes the other, and the care that the fathers and mothers of the familie, ought to haue of their children and families: I make a certaine discourse, touching the nature of the Beastes whiche haue some singuler gyfte more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue, in the coniunction of the male with the female, and in the affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their litle ones, and the care they haue of them.</p>
   <p>And therefore I speake, cheefely of the nature of the <hi>Pigeons,</hi> of the <hi>Swallows,</hi> of the <hi>Partridge,</hi> of the <hi>Hares,</hi> and of the <hi>Hedge-hogges,</hi> touching that point? and make comparison with those men, which doo not their dutie so well towardes theirs, as those beastes doo in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>
   <p>I doo adde also vnto those, the <hi>Halsion</hi> a Byrde of the Sea. And afterwardes I do also make mention of certayne fishes, and
<pb facs="4"/>
certayne Sea beastes, as the <hi>Phyces,</hi> the <hi>Lamprey,</hi> the <hi>Tortice,</hi> the sea <hi>Calfe,</hi> and the <hi>Crocodiles.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And after to conclude, I declare what is the office of fathers and mothers towards their children, according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paule.</hi>
