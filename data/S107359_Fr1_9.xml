   <head>THE LETTER OF THE LORD CARDINALL OF PERRON, <hi>SENT TO MONSIEVR CASAVBON INTO ENGLAND.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>SIR. the letter that you deliuered to Monsieur de la Bodery, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to me by him, euen as I was vpon my departure for a voyage into Normandy; and since my returne from thence, I haue bene almost perpetuallie sicke, which hindered me from answering with more speede. Now that my disease begins to be at some truce with me, I will paie the arrerages of this delaie, and will first thanke you for the good office that you haue done me, in shewing the letter I writt to you, to the most excellent king of great Brittaine, and in procuring me an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his fauour: I will striue so to husband it by my humble seruice s, (and particularlye by celebrating his prayses, which is the only fruite that good and vertuons kinges, such as hee doe gather from allthe labours and thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cares, that the burden of a kingdome loades them with,) as his maiestie shall haue noe cause to be sorrie, that it be declared to after ages, how he hath honord mee with his well wishes, ād how I haue had his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and admiration. As for the translation of the verses of Virgill, whereof you writt to me that he desires a Copie, that which I sent you being lost; I deferr yet for some daies, to acquit myself of that dutie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue put it to the presse, with the addition of a part of the fowrth, which I haue ended expresselie for his maiestie; sake, to inlarge my presēte to him. As soone as those few Copies which are in doing, shall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, I will not faile to addresse one of them to you, to offer vp to him on my behalfe The third point of your letter yet remaines; which is, that his Maiestie was astonisht at those wordes in my letter; That, excepting the title of Catholicke, I knew nothing wanting in him, to expresse the figure of a perfect and compleate Prince: and that he pretendes, that since he beleeues all thinges that the Ancientes haue with an vnanimous consent esteemed necessarie to saluation, the title of Catholique cannot bee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him. Now as on the one side, I can not but greatlie praise his maiesties pietie and Christian humilitie, in not disdayning to submitt his iudgement, adorned with so manie lightes naturall ād acquired, to that of those cleare beames of antiquitie; (imitating therein the wisdome of that great Emperor <hi>Thodosius;</hi> who thought there was noebetter meanes to agree the dissentions which disturbed the Church of his time, then to exact from either part an answere; whither thy beleeued that the Fathers which had flourish'd in the Church before the separation, had bene orthodoxall; and that being confessed, to summon them to submitt themselues to whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they should be found to haue beleeued:) so on the other side, there are manie obseruations `to be made vpon this Thesis, before wee passe to the hypothesis; which since I Cannot represent to his maiestie, I shall be gladd to informe you of them for your particular satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="2" facs="10"/>The first is, that the name of Catholicke, is not a name of beleefe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, but of Communion also; else antiquitie would not haue refused that title to those Which were not separated from the beleefe, but from the Communion of the Church: nor would they haue protested, that out of the Catholicke Church, the Faith and Sacramentes may be had, but not Saluation. <q>
         <hi>Out of the Catholicke Church,</hi> saith S. Augustin, in his treatie of Conference with Emeritus, a man may haue orders, hee maie haue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he may sing Alleluya, he may answere A men, he may keepe the Gospell, he may haue and preach the faith in the name of the Father, of the Sonn, and of the holie Ghost, but he can no where finde Saluation, but in the Catholicke Church. And in the Booke, De vtilit, credendi, There is a Church as all men graunt, if you cast your eyes ouer the extent of the whole world, more full in multitude, then all the rest; and as those, that know themselues to be of it, affirme, more sincere in the doctrine of truth.</q>
      <hi>But of the truth, that is an other question: that will suffice for this search, that there is one Catholicke Church, vpon which seuer all heresies impose seuerall names; whereas they are all call called euery one by his particular name, which they dare not disauow; from whence it may appeare to the iudgment of anie arbiter (that is not prepossessed by fauour,) to whom the name of Catholicke, where of all are ambitions, ought to bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</hi> And in the Booke against the fundamentall Epistle: <hi>Then to omitt this wisdome which you denie to bee in the Catholicke Church, there are manie other things, which doe most iustlie retaine me in her bosome: the consent of people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions retaine me therein; the authoritie begūn by miracles, nourished by hope, increased by charitie, confirmed by antiquitie, retaines me therein: the succession of Prelates euen from the verie seate of Peter, to whom our Lord deliuered his sheepe to be fedd after his Resurrection, euen to the present Bishops seate, retaines me therein: and finallie; the verie name of Catholick retaines me therein, which not without cause this Church alone, amongst so manie heresies, hath in such sorte obtained, as though all heretickes would be called Catholiques; neuerthelesse, when a stranger askes where the Catholicke Church doth assemble, there is not one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> that dares shew his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>, or his howse.</hi> And in his treatise of Faith, and of the Creede: <q>Wee beleeue the holie Church and that Catholick; for heretickes and schismatickes, call their Congregations Churches: but hereticks beleeuing of God false thinges, violate faith; and Schismatickes separate themselues from brotherly charitie by vniust diuisions, allthough they beleeue the same things that we beleeue: and therefore neither can the hereticke belonge to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, because she loues God; nor the schismaticke, because she loues her neightour. And in the Booke, Of the vnitie of the Church: All those that beleeue, as hath bene said that ouer Lord IESVS is come in the flesh, and is risen againe in the same flesh wherein he was borne, and hath suffered, and that he is the sōne of god, god with god, ād one with the Father, and the onlie immoueable word of the Father, by which all things haue bene made; but yet dissent so from his bodie, which is the Church, that theire communion is not with the whole; or is spread in deed, but yet is in some part found to be separate; it is manifest, they are not in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. And Prosper, his scholler: Hee, saith hee, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with this vniuersall Church, is a Christian and a Catholicke; but he that communicates not therewith, is an hereticke and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</q>
   </p>
   <p>And for this cause wee see, that the Fathers denied the title of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que to the Donatists, because of the separation of Communion, and yet graunted it to those, from whom the Donatists had taken their doctrine, because of the vnitie of Communion <hi>Cyprians people, saith</hi> S. <hi>Pacian, hath neuer bene called otherwise then Catholicke. And Sainct Vincentius Lerinensis: O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
change! the authors of one selfe same opinion, are adiudged Catholickes; and the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Contra li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. l 2. c 95</note>
      <hi>Sectaries heretickes!</hi> And <hi>S.</hi> Augustin; <hi>Dissention and diuision,</hi> saith hee, <hi>makes you heretickes, and peace and vnitìe makes Catholiques.</hi> And that in the fowrth Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> this article was inserted into the triall of the promotion of Bishops; whither they beleeue, that out of the Catholicke Church none cā be saued. And that in the Epistle of the Councell of Cyrtha, it was repeated by S. Augustin, who was Secretarie thereto, in theses wordes: <hi>Whosoeuer is separated from this Catholicke Church, how praise-worthie soeuer he conceaue his life</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. 1 52</note>
      <hi>to bee, by this onlie crime, that he is separated from the vnitie of Christ, he shall not haue life, but the wrath of God shall remaine vpon him.</hi> And after by <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in these wordes: <hi>Beleeue firmelie and doubt it not at all, that no hereticke or Schismaticke baptized in the name of the Father, of the sonne, and of the only Ghost, if he be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Catholicke Church, what almes soeuer he may giue, yea though he should shedde his blood for the name of Christ; can in any sort be saued.</hi> That I say was<note place="margin">De side ad Petr. c. 39.</note> against, or principallie against the Donatists. And neuerthelesse, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists agreed in all the doctrine of the Creede, and of the Scripture with the Catholicks: <hi>Your are with vs, saith</hi> S. <hi>Augustine, in Baptisme, in the Creede, and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. 48.</note>
      <hi>in all the other Sacraments of our Lord; but in the spirit of vnitie, and in the bond of peace, and finallie in the Catholicke Church, you are not with vs</hi> And yet they diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only in one pointe of vnwritten tradition, which, as S. Augustin himself (who principallie triumphes ouer this heresie) confessed, could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by Scripture. This, saith hee, in the Booke of the vnitie of the<note place="margin">Cap. 29.</note> Church, <hi>neither thou, nor I, doe euidentlie reade.</hi> And in the first Booke against<note place="margin">Cap. 33.</note>
      <hi>Cresconius; though for this there be noe example in the scriptures, yet euen in this wee follow, the truth of the Scriptures, when wee doe that which hath pleased the vniuersall Church, which the authoritie of the same scriptures doth recommend.</hi> And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōd Booke of Baptisme against the Donatists: <hi>And ourselues,</hi> saith hee, <hi>durst</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cap 4.</note>
      <hi>affirme no such thing, but that we are upheld by the vnanimous authoritie of the Church.</hi> And in the fift. <hi>The Apostles haue in this, prescribed vs nothing; but this custome which was opposite to Cyprian, ought to be beleeued to haue taken it's originall</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cap. 23.</note>
      <hi>from their tradition; as manie other things, which the vniuersall Church obserues, and for this cause are with good right beleeued to haue bene commaunded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, although they haue not bene vvritten.</hi> From whence it appeares, that to obtaine the name of Catholicke, it sufficeth not to hold, or rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to hold the same beleefe that the Fathers held, vnlesse they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the same Catholicke Church, wherewith the Fathers did communicate, and which by succession of persons, and, as wee pretend, of doctrine, is deriued downe to vs: and if she haue lost anie thing of her extent in our hemisphere, she recouers as much and more daily in the other hemisphere, that these prophecies may be fulfilled: <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 12. 26.</note>
      <hi>In thy seede, shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Gal 3.</note>
      <hi>In the last daies, the mountaine of the howse of our Lord, shall bee vpon the topp of mountaines, and shall be exalted aboue all the highe</hi>
      <note place="margin">l sa. 2.</note>
      <hi>hills, and all nations shall come vp to her.</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Matt 14.</note>
      <hi>This Ghospell of the Kingdome must be preached ouer all the world, and then the end shall come;</hi> and such like, in right<note place="margin">De vnit.</note> whereof the Church, as saith S. Augustin, hath obtained the title and the<note place="margin">Eccles. ca. 2. &amp; 3. &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi.</note> marke of Catholicke.</p>
   <p>The SECOND obseruation is vpon the restriction in Cases neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to saluation: For besides pointes necessarie to saluation, there are two other degrees of thinges, the one sort profitable to saluation, as it is (according to the opinion of your owne ministers) to sell all our goods and giue it to the poore: to fast in affliction to appease the wrath of God: to pray our Bretheren in the faith to praie to God for vs; and the other sort lawfull, and not repugnant to saluation, as to fly from persecution; to liue by the Altar, since we
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
serue at the Altar, to putt awaie our wiues for adulterie, and other the like for I alleadge these for examples, and not for instances. Now it is needefull to be cōformable to the integritie of the beleefe of the Fathers, to beleeue all thinges that they haue beleeued, according to that degree wherein they haue beleeued them: to witt, to beleeue for thinges necessarie to saluation those thinges that they haue esteemed to be necessarie for saluation: and for thinges profitable to saluation: those things that they haue esteemed to be profitable to saluation: and for things lawfull and not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to saluation, those thinges that they haue holden to be lawfull and not repugnant to saluation: and not vnder colour that the two last kindes, are not things necessarie to saluation, but only profitable or lawfull, to condemne them, and to separate ourselues for their occasion from the Church, which then had thē in practise, and still practiseth thē to this day.</p>
   <p>The third obseruation is vpon the ambiguitie of the word <hi>necessarie to saluation,</hi> which because of the diuers kindes of necessitie which haue place in matters of religion, is capable of diuers sences: for there is an absolute necessitie, and a conditionall necessitie; a necessitie of meanes, and a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of precept; a necessitie of speciall beleefe, and a necessitie of generall beleefe; a necessitie of act, and a necessitie of approbatio, I call an absolute necessitie (not simplie, but by vertue of Gods institution,) that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues no excuse of impossibilitie, nor anie exception of place, time or persons: as in regard of those that are of age, capable of knowledge, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Christ mediator betweene God and man: for neither the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of being in a place where wee cannot be instructed in that article; nor the preuention of time, in dying before wee are informed thereof; nor the condition of being an ignorant person, vnlearned, dull not apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; a sheepe and not a shepheard, can warrant those from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that beleeue it not actually, for as much as <hi>who beleeues not in the onlie Sonn of Gods, is alreadie iudged:</hi> And in regard of little Children, baptisme only according to our doctrine, may supplie the defect of Faith in Christ in their behalfe, agreeing with that sentence of S. Augustin: <hi>Doe not beleeue, doe not saie, doe not teache if thou wilt be a Catholick, that little children which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> by death, from being baptized, can come to the remission of originall sinne.</hi> And of this kinde of necessitie the examples are in small number. I call that conditionall necessitie which obligeth not but in case of possibilitie, and receiues exception of place, time and persons: and that againe hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers branches: For first in regard of Faith there are manie points that are necessarie to be beleeued, if a man be in place where he may be instructed in them, or who hath time to be informed of them, which are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for a man that liues in a wildernesse, or so pressed with the instant of death, as he hath noe leasure to receiue instruction: as that Christ was borne of a virgin that he was Crucified vnder Pontius Pilate, that hee rose againe the third daie. And manie thinges are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued and holden for pointes of Faith, either by the bodie of the Church in generall, or by the order of the ministers and pastors, which are the eyes of the Church: which are not necessary for euery particular person to knowe, and hold to be points of Faith; as that the persons of the Trinitie, are the same in essence, and distinct in subsistence; that the Father hath begotten the sonn necessarily and not freely; that they are the diuine persōs which produce, and are produced, and not the essence which doth neither produce, nor is produced: that the workes of the trinitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are vndiuided: that the only persō of the sonn hath been incarnate, and not anie of the others: that in Christ there are two substances and one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence: that the diuinitie was not to him in the steede of a soule, but
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
that besides his Bodie and his diuinitie, he had a Soule sensible and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: that what he once tooke in hypostaticall vnion hee hath not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: that the diuell was created good and made hinself euill by the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his will: and other such like. And in regard of action, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things necessarie in case of possibilitie, and according to the oportunity of places, times and persons, which are not absolutely necessarie, when the commoditie to accomplish them is wanting, as the assistance at Church Seruice, the actuall participation of the Eucharist. And manie are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to some, as mission and imposition of handes to the Pastors of the Church; and marriage to those that will haue issue which are not necessary to others. And in breefe, some thinges are necessary to obtaine Saluation others some to obtaine it more easilie for ones-selfe, and others to procure and mediate it for other men: some for the constitution of the Church, and others for the edification and more ample propagation of the Church some for the simple being of Christian Religion; others for the better being, that is to saie, for the comlynesse, dignitie, and splendour of Christian Religion. I call necessitie of meanes that, that is in behalfe of the thinges them selues as that of Sacraments to which god hath graunted power to Conferr some grace and reall operation to saluation, that of the Commandementes of the morall lawe, whose necessitie is imposed vpon vs by the law of nature, that of repenting sins, which is a meanes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to obtaine their remission. I call necessitie of precept, that which is only obligatorie in regard of the Commaundement, as the celebration of the first daie of the weeke in memorie of that wherein our lord did rise againe, which wee for that cause, call our Lords daie, and other such like obseruations, the omission whereof, could be noe hindrance to Saluation, but in respect of disobedience, and breach of the Commaundement. I call necessitie of speciall beleefe, that of thoses pointes, which all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if they be not preuented by death, are obliged to beleeue with faith expresse, distinct and determinate, which the Schoolemen call explicit faith; as the twelue articles, of the Creede. I call necessitie of generall beleefe, that of those thinges which euery particular man is not obliged to beleeue with a distinct ad explicite faith: as the doctrine of originall sin the article or the two wills in Christ, the article that the holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes frō the Father and from the Sonne; the beleefe that Baptisme giuē forth of the Church (prouided it be in the forme of the Church) is true Baptisme, and that heretickes which haue receiued Baptisme, must not be rebaptised when they returne to the Church: and other such like, when the simple sort of faithfull people, are not obliged to beleeue, with a distinct and explicit faith, but it sufficeth that they beleeue them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie in the Faith of the Church; that is to saie, that they adhere to the Church that beleeues them, by whose faith they liue whiles they remaine in her Communion, as Children liue by their mothers nourishmēt whilst they are in her bowells. I call necessitie of act, that of those thinges which euerie particular person is obliged to execute actuallie, as to Confesse the name of Christ, to forgiue offences done to them, to restore the Goods of an other man. I call necessitie of approbation, that of those thinges which euerie particular man is not bound to execute actuallie but onlie not to contradict them, and not to condemne those that doe them nor the church that approoues thē, ad not to separate thēselues frō her vpō this occasiō, vpō paine of separating themselues frō their owne saluation as the choice to liue in virginitie and single life, and other the like. Of all which kindes of necessitie, the Fathers haue hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> manie thinges (euerie one according to it is degree) diuerslie necessarie to saluation as wee shall
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
make manifest in those occasions that will offer themselues wherein to examine them: it is not to be conformable to the ancient beleefe and practise of the catholicke church, to hold the pointes of doctrine or actiō that the Fathers haue holden, to be necessary to saluation, according to some of these kindes of necessitie, and to reiect the others; but to conforme our selues to the ancient beleefe and catholick practise, we must hold for necessary to saluation, all those things that the Fathers haue holden to be necessarie to saluation, in that degree, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those kindes of necessitie, as they haue holden them.</p>
   <p>The fowrth obseruation is vpon the word FATHERS, which some, when it comes to the effect of their promise, to submit themselues to the iudgment of antiquitie, would restraine to the first or second age after the Apostles, not that they hope to finde in that space of time, anie thing in their behalfe: but because the Church being then oppressed with persecutions, there remaines to vs so fewe writinges of that date, and those against persons, and about points, for the most part so differing from the disputations of this present age, as the face of the ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practise of the Church, cannot euidentlie appeare to be therein represented. Now equitie would, that being to compare the state of the Societies of this age, wich pretend to the title of the Catholick Church, with the state of the ancient Church; wee should looke to take such a time, wherein not only our competitors might agree with vs, that the Church of the Fathers was still the true Church, the true Spouse of Christ, she in whom resided the lawfull authoritie to iudge questions in Religion: but also those monuments doe sufficiently remaine to vs, to manifest throughly all her doctrines and all her obseruations. Which can neuer be better chosen for both partes, then in the time wherein the fower first Councells were holden; that is to saie, from the Emperour Constantine, who was the first Emperour that was publicklie a Christian, to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Marcian. And it seemes to me, that his Maiestie hath yielded to this, and also more liberallie in some of his writinges, hauing extended this space, to the first fiue ages. For besides that the deliuerie from the yoake and subiection of the Pagans, then gaue the Church meanes to speake lowder, and to haue more communication with all her partes, situated in so manie different regions of the earth, and to flourish in a greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of learned and excellent writers, which is the cause that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to vs without comparison more monuments of those ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to view the entire forme of the ancient Christian Religion, then of the former ages: Besides this, I saie, our aduersaries cannot denie, but that church which nursed vp the first Christian Emperours, which rooted out the Temples and seruices of the false Gods, which exercised the Soue raigne Tribunall of Spirituall authoritie vpon earth, by the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which she denounced vpon the fowre most famous heresies in the fowre first generall Councells, which were the fowre first Parliaments and Estates generall of Christs Kingdome; must bee she of whom it hath<note place="margin">Isa. 60. 62. 54.</note> bene foretold, that Kinges should be her nursing Fathers: that the nations should walke in her light, and Kings in the brightnes of her rising: that, euery engine sett vp against her, should be destroyed: that she should iudge euery tongue that should resist her in iudgment: that God had sett watchmen vpon her walles, which neuer should be silent by daie or night:<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> that the gates of hell should not preuaile against her: that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer should not obey her should be holden for a heathen and a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:<note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      <hi>The Catholick Church fighting against all heresies, may be opposed, but she cannot be ouerthrowne: all heresies are come forth from her, as vnprofitable branches cutt From their vine, but she remains in her roote, in her vine in her charitie.</hi> Let that then bee holden for trulie anciēt, and marked with the character of the primitiue Church, which shall be found to haue bene beleeued and practised vniuersallie by the Fathers, which liued in the time of the first fowre Councells; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie when it shall appeare to vs, that the things testified to vs by the authors of those ages, were not holden by them for doctrines, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations sprung vp in their time but for doctrines or obseruations, which had bene perpetuallie practised in the Church from the age of the Apostles: although perchance, there can not be found for euerie of them in particular, so expresse testimonies in the former ages, as in those of the first fowre Councells, because of the fewe writinges which the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of those times, haue suffered to come to our handes. For it sufficeth to assure vs of the perpetuall vse of such thinges that the Fathers of the first fower Councells, who had more knowledge of the ages before them, then wee can haue, doe testifie to vs, to haue beleeued and practised them, not as thinges instituted in their age, but as thinges that haue alwaies had place in the Church, and had come to them by a succession of obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Apostles downe to their time; and that there is not to be found in former authors anie testimony against them, but contrariwise in all places, where there is occasion to mention them, agreable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable testimonies; that is to saie in breefe, that, is to be holden ancient by vs, which those whom we account ancient, haue themselues holden to be ancient.</p>
   <p>The fifth obseruation is vpon the consent of the beleefe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which some contentious spirits would haue to be, when one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing is actuallie found in the writings of all the Fathers, which is an vniust and impertinent pretence For to haue a doctrine or obseruation to bee trulie holden by the Fathers for vniuersall and Catholicke, it is not necessarie it should be in the writinges of all the Fathers, who haue not all written of the same matters, and of whose writinges, all haue not come to our handes: but there are two other lawfull waies, to secure our selues of them: The one is, when the most eminent Fathers of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try agree in the affirmation of the same doctrine or practise, and that none of the others that haue bene without note of dissention from the Church, haue opposed it: As when S. Augustin hath cited against the Pelagians, the<note place="margin">Contr. Iul. l. 5. &amp; 2.</note> testimonie of eleuen eminent Fathers, all consenting in one and the same doctrine; he supposeth hee hath sufficientlie produced against them, the Common beleefe of the Catholicke Church: and when the Councell of Ephesus had produced tenn Fathers of former ages, they conceiued they had sufficiently expressed the consent of the former Church against Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius<note place="margin">Vincent.</note> his doctrine: <hi>Because none,</hi> saith Vincentius Lerinensis, <hi>doubtetb but</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lirin. c. 42</note>
      <hi>that those tenn did trulie hold the same with al their other bretheren.</hi> The other is, when the Fathers speake not as Doctors, but as witnesses of the Customes and practise of the Curch of their times; and doe not saie, I beleeue this should be soe holden, or so vnderstood, or so obserued; but that the Church from one end of the earth to the other, beleeues it so, or obserues
<pb n="8" facs="13"/>
it soe: For then we noe longer hold what they saie, for a thing said by them, but as a thing said by the whole Church and principallie when it is in pointes whereof they could not be ignorant, either because of the Condition of the thinges, as in matters of fact, or because of the sufficiencie of the persons: and in this case wee argue noe more vpon their wordes probablie, as wee doe when they speake in the qualitie of particular Doctors, but we argue therevpon demonstratiuelie. That then shall remaine trulie vniuersall and Catholicke, that the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fathers of the times of the fowre first Councells, haue taught in seuerall regions of the earth; and against which, none (except some persons noted for dissention from the Church) hath resisted; or that the Fathers of those ages doe testifie to haue bin beleeued, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the whole Church in their times: And that shall remaine trulie antient and Apostolicke, that the Fathers of those ages doe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to haue bin obserued by the whole Church, not as a thing sprung vp in their time, but as a thing deriued downe to them either from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial succession of former ages, or from the expresse tradition of the Apostles. For these thinges hauing bin holden vniuersallie by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church in the time of the first fowre Councells, they could haue noe other originall, but from an vniuersall authoritie; for as much as in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, which did then so strictlie obserue the rule mentioned by <hi>Saint Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> of opposing vniuersalitie to particularitie; a doctrine or obseruation from a particular beginning could not be slipt in, ād spread into an vniforme and vniuersall beleefe ād Custome, through all partes of the Earth; and principallie soe as the Fathers that were next after these vniuersall innouations, could not perceiue it: but it must needes be, that all that was then vniuersallie obserued in the Church, must haue come from an vniuersall beginning. Now there were in those ages, according to the beleefe of your ministers, but two beginnings of vniuersall authoritie in the Church; to wit, either the Apostles, or the generall Councells; for they Will not yeild that the Sea Apostolicke had then anie vniversall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie And therefore whatsoeuer was vniuersallie and vniformly obserued in the Church by all the Prouinces of the Earth in the time of the first fowre generall Councells, and had not begun in that time, but had bin before practised; that is to saie; before there had bin anie generall Councell in the Church; must necessarilie haue bin from the tradition of the Apostles, following these rules of S.

      <note place="margin">Epist. 118.</note>
      <hi>not by writeing, but by tradition, which are kept ouer all the extent of the earth, must be vnderstood to haue bin retained from the appointemēt and institution, either of the Apostles themselues, or from the generall Councells, whose authoritie is most wholsome in the Church.

   <p>These fiue obseruations then made vpon the theses, I will saie, to passe vnto the hypothesis, that your ministers to whose societie his Maiestie
<pb n="9" facs="13"/>
outwardlie adheres, are so farr from holding all the same thinges that the Fathers haue beleeued and practised as necessarie to Saluation, that in the only Synaxis or Church Lirurgie, which is the Seale of Ecclesiasticall Communion, the fowre principall thinges for which they haue seperated themselues from vs, which are the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, the Oblation of the Sacrifice of the Eucharist, prayer and oblation for the dead, and the prayers of the Saints, the Fathers haue all vniuersallie and vniformely beleeued, holden and practised as things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie (but in different kindes of necessitie) vnto saluation. By which meanes, if your ministers had bene in the time of the Fathers, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> haue for these thinges renounced our Seruice and our Communion; so must they for the same causes haue renounced the Seruice and Communion of the Fathers, and Consequently, the title and Societie of the Catholicke Church. I haue said the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not but that I could haue gone farther, and said, the Substantiall transition of the Sacrament into the Bodie of Christ which wee call tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation but I haue been content to saie, the reall presence, because it is not precisely and particularlie vpon the transubstantiation, but vpon the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, that we ground the importance and necessitie of this Sacrament to Saluation; to witt, the Communion and Substantiall vnion to the Bodie of Christ; which S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill<note place="margin">In Ioan. lib. 11. cap. 27.</note> calls, the knott of our vnion with god. Nor is it particularly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely vpon transubstantiation, but vpon the reall presence that the two inconueniences depend, for which your ministers, in this article, seperate themselues from our Lyturgies; which are, one, the adoration of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ in the Sacramēt, which they will haue to be only sought and adored in heauen: and the other, the pretended distraction of the vnitie of the Bodie of Christ, by existence in manie places in the Sacrament. Neither haue I spocken of the prerogatiue of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which all the Fathers haue holden for the center and roote of Episcopall vnitie, and of Ecclesiasticall Communion; because I will beleeue you are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie read in antiquitie, to knowe that the first Fathers, Councells, and Christian, Emperors, haue perpetuallie granted therevnto, the primacie and supereminent ouersight, ouer all religions and ecclesiasticall things; which is all that the church exacts as a point of Faith, from their confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that enter into her communion, to the end to discerne her societie from that of the Greekes and other complices of their Sect, wich haue deuided themselues for some ages, from the visible and ministeriall head of the Church.</p>
   <p>These fowre points then, which are the principall Springes of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention and which being agreed vpon, it would be easie for vs to agree vpon the rest; I saye, that the Fathers of the time of the fowre first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels haue all holden and practised as necessary to Saluation, though with diuers kindes of necessitie. The reall Presence, of the Bodie of Christ; and the oblation of the sacrifice, they haue holden as necessary with necessitie of meanes, for the Bodie of the Church absolutely, and for euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler person conditionnallie. Prayer and oblation for the dead they haue holden as necessarie, by necessitie of meanes for those for whom it is done that soe their deliuerace from temporall paines, which remaine after this life for sinne cōmitted, after baptisme, ād for which thy haue not done such penances as it hath pleased God whollie to accept, may be hastned by the prayers and sacrifices of the Church: and necessarie with necessitie of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and to exercise christian charitie and pietie both to the Church that offers them, and to the ministers and Pastors by whom she offers them.
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
The prayer of the Saintes, they haue holden as necessarie to the bodie of the Church, and to the ministers by whō they are made, with necessitie of precept, to exercise the commerce betweene the Church Militant, and the Church Triumphant: and to particular persons out of the offices of the Church, and in their priuate deuotions not neeessary with necessitie of act, but only profitable, that they may the more easilie obtaine pardon for their sinnes, by the concourse of their prayers who are alreadie in the per fect and assured possession of the grace of God: but necessary to them and all others with nessitie of approbation; that is to saie, they are obliged not to contradict them, and not to condemne the custome and doctrine of the Church in that article: and not to separate themselues from her vpon this occasion, vnder paine of falling into Anathema, and to be holden for heretickes. All which things I will not now stand to proue, least I make a Booke of a letter; but I doe oblige myselfe to iustifie them, when soeuer you shall desire it; and to make it appeare both by the vnanimous consent of the Fathers, that haue flourished in the time of the first fowre councel's, and by the formes which remaine to vs in their writings of the ancient Church Seruice, that all the Catholicke Church of their times hath vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nersallie and vniformely beleeued holden and practised them, throughout all the regions and prouinces of the earth. I oblige myself I saie, to make it appeare to you, that she hath holden these fower thinges in the same sence, and in the same forme and for the same end, as our Lyturgies are, and not as obseruations that then sprung vp, but as things that the same Fathers testified to haue bene beleeued and practised from all antiquitie, and to be deriued to them by an vninterrupted continuance from the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or approbation of the Apostles. Soe as they cannot renounce the Communion of our Church vnder pretence of anie of these fowre points, without renoūcing the Communion of the ancient catholick Church and consequently the inheritance of saluation: and that by authors and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies all able to abide the touch; as you know I am curious to make vse of noe other; and with cleare and ingenuous answeres to all obiections, collected out of the Fathers of the same ages, or of ages before them. A thing that will be the more easie for me, because the proofes that wee will avouch out of the Fathers, are proofes which containe in expresse termes the affirmatiue of what wee saie: whereas our aduersaries cannot finde one only passage which containes in expresse terme the negatiue, but only in termes from whence they pretend to inferr it by consequence; and which at a iust tribunall, would not merit so much as to be heard. For who knowes not, that it is too great an iniustice, to alleadge consequences from passages, and euen those euill interpreted and misvnderstood, and in whose illation, there is alwaies some paralogisme hidd against the expresse wordes, and the liuely and actuall practise of the same fathers, from whom they are collected, and that may be good to take the Fathers for Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and to accuse them for want of Sence or memorie; but not to take them for Iudges, and to submitt themselues to the obseruation of what they haue beleeued and practised? To this I will also adde whensoeuer you shall desire it, the present Conformitie of all the other Patriarchall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in these fowre cases with the Roman and of all those which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained euen to this daie, vnder their iurisdiction; to witt, those that are vnder the Patriarchall iurisdiction of the Patriarck of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> as the <hi>Grecians, Russians, Muscouites, and Asians of Asia-minor,</hi> separate from vs neere eight hundred yeares: Of those that are vnde the Greeke Patriarch of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> as the <hi>Syrians, Mesopotamians,</hi> and others yet more Easterne nations: (for those that obey the <hi>Syrian</hi> Patriarch, as the <hi>Maronites,</hi> perseuer in the
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; of those that relye vpon the <hi>Egiptian</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the Egiptians whom they call <hi>Cophtites,</hi> and the Ethiopians which haue bene diuided both from vs and from the greekes more then eleuen hundred yeares, euen from the time of one of the fowre first Councells, to witt, of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> For all these hold these fower pointes; yea, with more iealousie, if it be possible, then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Churches, and particularlie, the article of the Sacrament, where of they doe not only beleeue transubstantiation, which the greekes at this daie call in the very self same sence and phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, but also exercise the adoration with externall gesture, more full of humilitie then ours. A manifest proof that these fowre pointes were vniformely holden and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by the ancient Cahtholicke Church, since all the partes, whereinto the ancient Catholicke Church is dismēbred, doe retaine them vniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this daie; notwithstanding soe manie distances, separations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, through all the regions of the Earth.</p>
   <p>These are in generall, the causes that haue moued me to vse that excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my letter, that you obiect to me in yours: whereof if the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King of great Brittaine had as well leasure to heare the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as he hath capacitie to comprehend them, I assure myselfe he would not thinke it strange, that I should desire in him the title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique;</hi> but he would desire it himsefe, and put himsefe in state to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, and to cause it to be obtained by those, that are depriued of it: that is to saie, he would add yet to is other Crownes, that of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sefe a mediator of the peace of the Church; which would be to him a more triumphant glorie, then that of all the <hi>Alexanders,</hi> and of all the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and which would gaine to his Isle, noe lesse an honor in hauing bredd him, thē to haue bredd great <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first deliuerer and pacifier of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.
