      <hi>Nicholas Machiavelli,</hi> to the Magnificent <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> sonne to <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> health.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey, that desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themselves with a Prince, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly use to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his view, with things of that nature, as such persons take most pleasure and delight in: whereupon wee see they are many times presented with Horses and Armes, cloth of gold, pretious stones, and such like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, worthy of their greatnesse. Having then a mind to offer my selfe to your Magnificence, with some testimony of my service to you, J found nothing in my whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory, that I thinke better of, or more esteeme, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="6"/> of great mens actions, which I have learnd by a long experience of moderne affaires, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reading of those of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Which, now that J have with great diligence long work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> it out, and throughly sifted, J commend to your Magnificence. And however I may well think this work unworthy of your view; yet such is your humanity, that I doubt not but it shall find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, considering, that for my part I am not able to tender a greater gift, than to present you with the meanes, whereby in a very short time you may be able to understand all that, which I, in the space of many yeares, and with many suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and dangers, have made proofe and gaind the knowledge of. And this worke I have not set forth either with elegancy of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or stile, nor with any other ornament whereby to captivate the reader, as others use, because J would not have it gaine its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme from elsewhere, than from
<pb facs="6"/> the truth of the matter, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ravity of the subject. Nor can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>his be thought presumption; if a man of humble and low condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>enture to dilate and discourse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pon the governments of Princes; for even as they that with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ensills designe out countreys, get themselves into the plaines below to consider the nature of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      </gap>t to be a Prince, and to know well the dispositions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, sutes best with the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a subject. Your Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence then may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> pleasd, to receive this small present, with the same mind that J send it; which if you shall throughly peruse and consider, you shall perceive therein that J exceedingly wish, that you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that greatnesse, which your own Fortune, and your excellent endowments promise you: and if
<pb facs="7"/> your Magnificence from the very point of your Highnesse shall some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cast your eyes upon these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour places, you shall see how undeservedly I undergoe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and continuall despight of Fortune.</p>
