proceeding, and conformable to what is observed within this renowned City: As also it was agreed upon betweene Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third, and this most illustrious Common-Wealth, in the yeare 1551. Chap. 18. 19.</p>
   <p>Which in my respectfull opinion may easily be done, if the orders made upon severall occasions be reduced unto Chapters, and thence as it were a recapitulation framed, wherein shall briefly and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily be set downe so much as is necessary to be observed, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies may be given either of the Heads alone, or joyned with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid determination it shall seeme best.</p>
   <p>I will first gather the Heads, then will I adde the considerations and causes for which these Orders were first established to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God; for the which it is also necessary to continue the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them, for the maintenance of holy Religion, and publicke quietnesse.</p>
