                 <title>A discussion of the popish doctrine of transubstantiation : vvherein the same is declared, by the confession of their owne writers, to haue no necessary ground in Gods Word: as also it is further demonstrated to be against Scripture, nature, sense, reason, religion, the iudgement of the auncients, and the faith of our auncestours: written by Thomas Gataker B. of D. and pastor of Rotherhith</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleased (I pray thee) to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in a word, as <hi>the occasion of vndertaking,</hi> so <hi>the motiue of publishing</hi> this <hi>Controuersie.</hi> Hauing had some <hi>Conference</hi> with <hi>an Honourable Lady nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,</hi> whom some <hi>Factors</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi> had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to peruert, about the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> and <hi>Christs corporall presence in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist;</hi> I was by her requested to deliuer her in writing, the summe of that that had passed then by word of mouth from me, as well in way of <hi>Answere</hi> to the <hi>exceptions</hi> taken to <hi>our Doctrine,</hi> as in way of <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>the Romane tenet</hi> therein. Whereupon within a few daies after, hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested it as well as streights of time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and added some further <hi>enforcements</hi> of the generall <hi>heads</hi> then insisted on, I deliuered it <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> as here thou now hast it. Which writing being imparted to one of those <hi>Factors, a speedy answere</hi> was promised, and (after <hi>long expectation</hi> of it) at length performed, such as here it is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited (vnder the letters of <hi>N.

added, or altred. Vnto which I soone after dispeeded <hi>a Reply;</hi> which was to the same <hi>Honourable Personage</hi> also not long after repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. Now hauing hitherto heard of nothing returned further thereunto, (albeit some yeeres be past since the exhibition of it) I haue thought good by the aduice of some <hi>iudicious Friends</hi> to publish all together (my <hi>Reply</hi> onely in some few places enlarged) as well thereby the more fully to cleere some <hi>obiections</hi> vrged commonly (to the simpler sort especially) against <hi>our Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning <hi>that Sacrament,</hi> and our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of some passages of <hi>holy writ,</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, or supposed to concerne the same; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so further to discouer (to such especially as are not so well acquainted therewith) <hi>the grosse and palpable frauds and falshoods,</hi> with such <hi>Popish Factours</hi> too frequent, which in the aduised rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perusing hereof may easily and euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be descried. And this is all that (not listing to detaine thee long from the <hi>discourse</hi> it selfe) I was desirous by way of <hi>Preface</hi> to fore-acquaint thee withall. The <hi>Lord</hi> vouchsafe thee and vs all <hi>true vnderstanding, sound iudgement,</hi> and <hi>a loue of the truth</hi> both in this and in all other things.</p>
