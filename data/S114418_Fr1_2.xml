<pb facs="3"/>
which, was I might not of duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I haue neuer beene vnwilling thankefully to render: I perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet more deeplye what to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>tate, as wherein I might best declare the one and performe the other, or at the least expresse a good-will to eyther. But finding that I could not any way else so well answer to the one and satisfie the other in all partes and points, I gladly resolued to present vnto your worship this my <hi>Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as that which I esteeme a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not vnworthy a Right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull presence and like accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in regarde of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the matter, howsoeuer it seemeth shaddowed vnder my poore Pen. For verily therein (as your worship reading the same may perceiue) are summarily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and briefly cowched the
<pb facs="3"/>
principall Grownds of Christian Religion, selected and drawne foorth (as certaine sweet streames) from the pure Fountaine of the most sacred Scriptures, the which not only the most Mightie in his Grace and mercy hath both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, preserued and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Church: but also wee (which are of the houshould of Faith, and haue the warrant of his spirite, which giueth testimonie thereof to our spirites) doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beleeue to bee the verye Touch-stone whereby the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of spirites is knowen the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect line, by the which the Temple is measured: the rodde whereby a mans wayes are corrected: the Angle with the which the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fishers vse to take men: and to be briefe, the Lanterne for our feete, the light to our pathes; and
<pb facs="4"/>
that blessed Table whereon is proposed to vs in Christ, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull foode of soules, whereby men are fed and nourished to life euerlasting. In regard whereof, as all men are bound to praise the high excellencie of that heauenly fountaine, and therein to gloryfie God: so am I iustly occasioned to protest for the verity and sweete sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of these streames, which in the diuine feare and due regarde of duty, I haue not only thence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued: but also produced to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes examined and tryed by the authority of the same: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do now with the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse presume to present vnto your worship: praying you to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe both this my present, your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull acceptation, and my good will therein, your gentle estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the which I shall be no lesse

thankefull, then for other your friendly courtesies. And euen thus I commit you with your right worshipfull Partener to the Almighty.</p>
