                 <title>A quench-coale. Or A briefe disquisition and inquirie, in vvhat place of the church or chancell the Lords-table ought to be situated, especially vvhen the Sacrament is administered? : VVherein is evidently proved, that the Lords-table ought to be placed in the midst of the church, chancell, or quire north and south, not altar-wise, with one side against the wall: that it neither is nor ought to be stiled an altar; that Christians have no other altar but Christ alone, who hath abolished all other altars, which are either heathenish, Jewish, or popish, and not tollerable among Christians. All the pretences, authorities, arguments of Mr. Richard Shelford, Edmond Reeve, Dr. John Pocklington, and a late Coale from the altar, to the contrary in defence of altars, calling the Lords-table an altar, or placing it altarwise, are here likewise fully answered and proved to be vaine or forged.

      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, since the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of this Treatise a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Story hath fallen out
in the Tovvne of Colchester, in
the County of Essex, vvorthy
publike knovvledge, vvhich I
shall here relate.</p>
   <p>One Thomas Nuceman Parson of the Parish Church of
S. Runwald in Colchester caused the Communion-Table in
his Church to be removed and rayled in Altarwise; Which
done he enjoynes all the Communicants to come up to the
new rayle, and there to kneel downe and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
refusing to administer the Communion to any but
such who came up to the rayle, though present in the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and ready to receive it in the accustomed place and
maner, and commaunding the Church-Warden to present
them to D. Aylot (the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate,
for that Towne during his Metropoliticall Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="352" facs="223"/>
for not receiving, when as they should have presented
him for not giving them the Communion, when as they there
profered to receive it, after their auncient maner. One Mr.
Burroes of that Parish being thrice put by the Sacrament,
for not comming up to this new rayle, and yet presented for
not receiving, thereupon prefers a Bill of Inditement upon
the Statute of 1. Eliz. c. 2. against Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oman for this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at Colchesters Sessions: Which Inditement being ill
drawen, and most of the grand Iury Nucomans friends, an
<hi>Ignoramus</hi> was retained thereon, and <hi>Dulman</hi> the Clerke
that drew it, might have well been added thereto.</p>
   <p>This Inditement only exhibited so troubled Nucoman
and Dr. Aylot, that the next Court-day Mr. Burroes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
for not appearing in Court, though he made
his personall apparance, and there continued till the Court
was risen, as he could prove by 20 witnesses, and the Dr and
Register both confessed as much, (such strange justice and
vexatious oppression now raignes in these spitefull, I should
say spirituall Courts.)</p>
   <p>The next Lords day, Nucoman publisheth the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in the Church, and then sends the Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
to Mr. Burroes there present to commaund him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Church: VVho comming to him accordingly; He
told them, that the Excommunication certainly was forged
by Nucoman his enemie, that there was none granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him in the Court, for he was present all the while;
And how ever, it came not out in the Kings name, under the
Kings Seale, and by an authority derived immediately from
the King by speciall Letters Patents, as it ought by Law to
doe, and the expresse provision of the Statutes of 1. Ed. 6.
c. 2. 1. Eliz. c. 1. 8. Eliz. c. 1. and therefore it was voyde
in Law, neither would nor could he in poynt of loyally to
his Majesty obey it, being not made by his authority. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Church-wardens left him.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="353" facs="223"/>
Nucoman hereupon bids them carry him out of the
Church; The Church-wardens refuse to doe it. Then he
chargeth the Constables to doe it: Who c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ming to Mr.
Burro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s; he told them, that he was not excommunicated, that
they had nothing to doe in the Church, neither was it any
part of their office but the Church-wardens to remove him,
and therefore bid them to doe no more then they could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
by Law, else they should smart for it. Upon this they
left him.</p>
   <p>Nucoman hereupon puts off his Surplesse, closeth
his Booke and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eth out of the Church, the people follow
him by degrees.</p>
   <p>Mr. Burroes sits still till about 11. of the clocke when the
Clerke came to shut the dores.</p>
   <p>The next day there was a great stirre about this busines,
Nucoman would have this a disturbance against the Statute
of 1. Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e. c. 3. Mr. Burroes said, that he was the disturber
and the Dr, for publishing and granting such an illegate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
and giving over divine service without
cause, and that he was not to goe out by Law if the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
had been legall, but ought to have been carried
out by the Church-wardens, and so was no disturber. Much
adoe there was about it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Burroes to cleare the busines goes to the Register and
Dr. to know whether he was excommunicated or no, and
for what cause.</p>
   <p>At first they denyed he was excommunicated, neither
would they believe that Nucoman had published any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
against him: Which when he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
they then told him he was excommunicated indeed by
the Court: He demaunded for what cause? They answered
for not appearing: He replied he was present all the while
in Court, and that they both knew to be true; And is this,
said he, your justice to excommunicate men for not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
when they are all the while in Court?</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="354" facs="224"/>
To which Dr. Aylot answered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Sir, you are an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious
fellow indeed, you will indite your Minister for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
we will take you downe in time, and teach you
how to indite Ministers, I will excommunicate you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> all the
Parishes round about and throughout England, and see who
dares absolue you, for Inhibition I am sure you can have
none.</p>
   <p>VVill you so Mr. Dr. said he, I thought your power had
not been so large as to reach over all England, nor your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and insolency so great as to excommunicate his
Majesties subjects thus against Law, for inditing these that
breake both his Majesties Lawes and Declarations; If you
abuse me thus as you say, you will, I will not only goe to
Church notwithstanding your excommunication, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bring you into the Star-chamber for abusing me in this
maner.</p>
   <p>Well the<note n="*" place="margin">This Dr. is an high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, and when any man oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his extortions or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations presently he hath a dormant warrant and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevant to arrest and vex the parties<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> With which course he hath so vexed &amp; abused the Country and his Majesties authority, that hanging is to good for him; The like have other Commissioners done.</note> Dr. proceeds, excommunicates him upon no
grounds in other Parish-Churches, threatens him with the
High Commission, only for inditing Nucoman for abusing
him as before, and bringing in Innovations. And doth not
such a rejected wilfull oppressing unjust Ecclesiasticall Iudge
deserve to be trussed up for such proceedings? Were<note n="§" place="margin">His 5. Sermon before King Edward, fol. 64.</note>
      <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Latymer</hi> now alive, and should heare such a story of an
Ecclesiasticall Iudge, (and most of them are of the same Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
he would not sticke to say before the <hi>King</hi> himselfe; J
<hi>would wish that of such a Iudge in England now we might have
the skin hanged up. It were a goodly signe, the signe of the
Iudges skinne.</hi> And certainly till the skins of some of these
Spirituall Devill-Iudges be fleyde off, and their neckes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with a Tiburne-tippet for their extortions and strange
<pb n="355" facs="224"/>
oppressions of his Majesties people, in a way of justice, the
people shall never live in quiet, but the Wolves will bite and
devour them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Burroes, notwithstanding all this malice, proceeds in
his resolution as well as the Dr. on the 2. of October last,
being the Lords-day, he goes to his owne Parish-Church,
without any absolution, whereupon Nucoman gives over
service and departs, and all the people after him; Then he
goes to another Church where he was excommunicated;
And after that to a third, they all doe the like and leave the
Church.</p>
   <p>On Monday the 3. of October, being the Sessions-day
for the Towne, he prefers a new Inditement against Nuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for his Innovations, the Mayor and Recorder persuade
him to desist, he refuseth to doe it; Then they wish him to
put it off till next Sessions, because it was a new case. He
answered, the case was plaine, and that he must by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
indite him this Sessions or not at all. Then they fall
to perswade the Iury, not to finde the Inditement; The Iury
being stout honest men, notwithstanding finde it, <hi>Billa vera,</hi>
this Innovation of Nucoman being a notorious affront both
against the Statute and his Majesties late Declarations; They
desire them to change their verdict; The honest men refuse
to doe it: Thereupon the Sessions is presently adiourned for
10. dayes.</p>
   <p>Nuoman posts to the Arch-bishop of Canterbury, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaint
him with these proceedings, and to crave his direction
what shalbe done.</p>
   <p>Upon his retorne he brings downe a Pursevant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with him to arrest Mr. Burroes only for prosecuting him
in the Kings behalfe, enters his house, and first by pollicy,
after that by power seekes to apprehend him, sets the whole
Towne in an uproare, gets the Sessions adiourned 9. weekes
longer to the end that he may escape the punishment of the
Statute, and remove the Inditemeut thence into the Kings
<pb n="356" facs="225"/>
Bench for delay. Thus are the Kings good Subjects abused by
a packe of Iewde companions, and the High Commission
made the Instrument, not only of oppressing his Majesties
best subjects, but of patronizing knaues and offenders in
their open contempts against his Majesties Lawes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
the chiefe use it now serves for. Master
Burroes threatens them all with the Star-chamber, for
a conspiracie, and denying him and the Kings Iustice; And so
the matter yet hangs in suspence.</p>
   <p>This case is like to be a president for all England to follow;
And if all people where Communion-Tables are turned into
Altars, or rayled in Altarwise, or they inforced in a new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to come up to the rayle to receive; will preferre the like
Inditements against their Ministers (yea and Bishops too,
the chiefe Agents in these Novelties, upon the second clause
of the Statute of 1. Eliz. c. 2.) whereupon they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
6. whole monthes, without bayle or mainprise, upon
the first Conviction and Inditement, and to forfaite one whole
yeares profits of all their Ecclesiasticall livings &amp; promotiōs;
And for the second, to be imprisoned and deprived of all
their livings <hi>ipso facto;</hi> for the third to forfait all their goods,
and be for ever made uncapable of any Ecclesiasticall living
or preferments; Our busy Romish Innovatours will shrinke
in their bornes, &amp; we shalbe no more troubled with Altars,
rayling in Lords-Tables, or ascending up to them to receive.
For their ease &amp; encouragement, in which good work, I shall
