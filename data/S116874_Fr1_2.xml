      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Office of a Sherife, as it is a Place of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Trust, in the gouernment of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, so withall is it and Office of great perill and danger, not onely to the Sherife himselfe, but also to the Kings Maiestie, and to his Subiects in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, if the same be not truly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully executed in euerie behalfe. It were therefore meet, that such as shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted thereto be men of Worth and
<pb facs="4"/> Note, not onely for the sufficiencie of their estate, but also for their sinceritie and honestie: Neither are all these suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, where the High-Sherife shall trust his Vnder-Sherife with the whole businesse. And it is further to be wished, That the Gentlemen of the Country, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the burthen of this office lieth, would keepe this their Office in their hands, and their Ʋnder-Sherife in their houses, that so by their continuall eye ouer their Officers, &amp; care of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, they might the better discharge their dutie herein. And for that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that a plaine discouerie of this Office would giue encouragement to the Gentrie, so to vndertake the same, the consideration thereof caused me former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to present to the view of the world, my Labours in this Businesse (though before they came to any ripenesse: And albeit I haue sithence learned little of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and secresie of the same Office (I meane as it is commonly practised by some vnder Sherifes) and therfore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet bring it to any perfection: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse I thought it fit according to
<pb facs="4"/> my poore abilitie still to endeauor my selfe therein, and to bring the same at least to a more short, easie, and readie Method. And accordingly I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in set down their Authoritie and Office, far more plainly and briefely than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with reference to my booke at large, where the Reader may receiue more full satisfaction. And I haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to labour in this businesse, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue occasion to others, better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and experienced, to perfect a worke so needfull. I acknowledge this my weak vndertaking, farre vnworthy of your Lordships iudicious Eyes, much more vnworthie so great a Patronage; and yet for that I stand bound in duty to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and lay downe my Labours where I owe my Seruice; and againe for that your Lordship in regard of your high Place, hath a principall charge vnder the Kings Maiestie, for the appointing and naming of these great Officers of Iustice; and in regard of your profound Iudgement, Wisedome, and Experience, your Lordship is best able to iudge of the mischiefes, and to giue remedie therin;
<pb facs="5"/> as also for that I haue a peculiar rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Honorable Court, where your Lordship is supreame Iudge: To you therefore I humbly and submissiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie present this little Treatise. The God of Heauen and Earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your Honour long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, to the good of his Church, and of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
