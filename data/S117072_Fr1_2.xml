      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending to set downe in a summary way, the grounds of <hi>the Office of Exchange,</hi> and the causes of the late <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the <hi>execution</hi> thereof. I found it would be necessary by way of preface to levell and prepare the mindes of such who perhaps haue bin attempted to be <hi>prepossessed</hi> with many vntrue and scandalous rumors touching the same, since in a thing although not <hi>new,</hi> yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of disvsage to some seeming <hi>as new,</hi> it may prevaile much in prejudice of a cause, that men haue false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions or conceipts of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or done; to the end therefore that the mind freed of these, may be placed in that even and cleere as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as may be fit, for the right vnderstanding and judging of what shall bee represented vnto it, I must from such as may pervse this short Treatise, desire by way of postulation or request.</p>
   <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> that notwithstanding what they may haue heard, they doe not conceiue, that the <hi>Office,</hi> or graunt
<pb facs="3"/>thereof in the Letters Patents intends or actually <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines</hi> the <hi>libertie of the subiect</hi> in <hi>generall,</hi> but that he is <hi>free,</hi> (as before the Patent.)</p>
   <p n="1">1. To sell his plate vessell, or other manufactures, or other gold or siluer whatsoeuer, to any Goldsmith, or other person whomsoeuer to his best advantage.</p>
   <p n="2">2 That he is <hi>free</hi> to carry his gold and silver immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to the mint there to haue the same coyned, whether he be a <hi>Merchant</hi> that imports the same from beyond the feas: Or <hi>other subiect,</hi> hauing the same from his Mines, of his Plate, receipts or monyes comming of his wares, or other commodities.</p>
   <p>Nor doth it <hi>restraine the Goldsmith, or other Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in particular.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="1">1. They may vse their trade of <hi>Goldsmithrey,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trades as fully and amply as heretofore they law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully might or could doe.</p>
   <p n="2">2. They may vse and enioy, all such <hi>franchises</hi> and other <hi>liberties</hi> and <hi>graunts</hi> which they lawfully haue or hold from the Charters of his Maiestie or any his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</p>
   <p n="3">3. They may <hi>buy</hi> and <hi>Plate vessell, burnt silver, broken silver or other</hi> in fashion or out of fashion, or any other <hi>manufacture</hi> to be imployed in their Trades or resold, as they might doe before the Patent.</p>
   <p n="4">4. They may buy any <hi>gold or silver whatsoeuer</hi> or of <hi>whomsoeuer</hi> to make plate of, or to be vsed in the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manufactures of their trades.</p>
   <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> I should desire, no man should conceiue of this <hi>as grounded vpon the absolute power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue royall of the King,</hi> But as the <hi>premption of Bullion,</hi> or Materials of mintage, is a right inherent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
<pb facs="3"/>trusted to the Crowne; so alwaies haue the <hi>Kings</hi> of this Realme exercised this office by their Farmers and Patentees as belonging to them <hi>by right and prerogatiue legall, A Right</hi> of such nature, as that by which <hi>Royall mynes, Treasure troue,</hi> and such like doe belong vnto the <hi>Crowne,</hi> And as it is not raised, so is it not intended to be enlarged, or extended beyond the bounds and limitts set to it by the Law: or vpheld by any other means, then the ordinarie courses of Iustice, free to all in his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Courts of Iudicature, to which euery man justly grieued by the Patent, or the execution thereof, is left to obtaine his lawfull rights and amends.</p>
   <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that the office may no way bee taken as to sauour of Monopolie; this including a <hi>restraint</hi> of what was lawfull; and <hi>a setting of a price</hi> vpon a free merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, at the pleasure of private persons to their owne gaine, in prejudice of the publike: But the office is and ought to be acquited of both these Challenges, and most justly: For although the <hi>mettals of gold and silver</hi> (as things many waies vsefull) haue bin and are the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Trade, yet when they are <hi>considered as Bullion, and as the materials of Coine with reference to the Mint:</hi> In this <hi>relation,</hi> they become the <hi>sole preragatiue and right of Princes</hi> who haue power to enstampe them with their Image and superscription, thereby giuing them <hi>curran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> amongst their people, and appointing them <hi>publique measures for</hi> the valuing and gouerning the estates and contracts of their subiects, whereupon it hath neuer bin lawfull heere, nor (in any well gouerned <hi>forreine slate</hi>) was there euer permitted <hi>a promiscuous buying of Bullion,</hi> to buy, sell or traffique gold or silver <hi>merchantwise, or to driue any Trade vpon the profit thereof,</hi> and so to come
<pb facs="4"/>betwixt the Merchant, or other iubject, and the Mint, but to such as were authorised and appointed by the State herevnto: <hi>This being the full proper and adaquate subiect of the Office of Exchange,</hi> The soueraignty of the Prince and State, hauing beene euer esteemed faint and vaine <hi>in the forme and valuation of monyes;</hi> if the <hi>materials,</hi> and the supply thereof should bee <hi>at the pleasure of others;</hi> As heere it hath lately beene at the pleasure of some few Goldsmiths, and <hi>accidentally</hi> brought to the Mint, when no offer of gaine did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe their supplie. <hi>And for the price;</hi> that is alwaies <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> though dependent vpon the Prince his standard <hi>Bullion</hi> not like other merchandise, according to more or few buyers, plentie or scarcity, or the vse or disuse thereof, or other accidents <hi>rising or falling in price;</hi> but alwaies hauing one <hi>certaine and vnchoengeable value and rate: according to</hi> the weight <hi>and finenesse thereof,</hi> viz. <hi>That for gold and silver Bullion in forreine species or other, there be giuen a like, and the same quantity of gold or silver Corned equiualent weight for weight.</hi> The <hi>seller onely aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Coinage and price of Exchange,</hi> Both which are to be <hi>taxed</hi> by the <hi>authoritie of the</hi> Prince, <hi>or lawes</hi> of the State, as in this particular they are by his <hi>Maiesties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures of the Mint:</hi> And <hi>of the Exchange,</hi> And the last being likewise according to Act of Parliament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made with much temper thereunto.<note place="margin">ix. H. v. c.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note>
      <hi>Nor</hi> will any I hope be much prejudiced with the murmures and complaints of some few <hi>exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Goldsmiths,</hi> whose <hi>vsurped and abused Trade</hi> is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off, since (the premises considered) this will appeare to all to be but the <hi>power and practise</hi> of those few (not many more then ten persons) and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailement
<pb facs="4"/>with the rest of the company, vpon false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of prejudices, neither granted nor claimed; Because it wilbe impossible <hi>to assigne,</hi> or shew, how or wherein the <hi>true Goldsmith</hi> receiues prejudice, when he is not barred from buying, selling, or doing any thing that euer did or doth belong to their trades, or euer was vsed or practised but by those few, who <hi>leauing off their proper trade of Goldsmithrie,</hi> and <hi>contrary to their Charter,</hi> are vnduely become <hi>Exchangers,</hi> Interlopers betwixt the Merchant and the Mint, And <hi>Intruders</hi> hereby vpon his Maiesties <hi>Regalities,</hi> to the losse of his Maiestie in the profit of his Coynage, and Exchange; And generall prejudice of the Realme, <hi>by the opportunity they</hi> haue had and practised from hence, of being <hi>the sole instruments of exportation</hi> of gold and silver to the strangers, <hi>The sorters and cullors</hi> out of all the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his Maiesties coine, which they haue <hi>transported or moulten downe,</hi> occasioning hereby the great <hi>scarcity of silver</hi> monyes, and the <hi>standing still of the Mint</hi> for sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver monyes euer since xj<seg rend="sup">mo</seg> of the late King, and by both a <hi>decrease of the</hi> trade and imployment of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, And by all <hi>an impouerishment</hi> and destruction of the Realme.</p>
   <p>And now presuming the indifferent and vnpartiall will (at least) withhold his censures, vntill euery alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation against the office shall be vpon particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, cleered and <hi>resolued;</hi> I desiring, their like pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of perufall, proceed to make manifest.</p>
   <p>First, <hi>His Maiesties legall right thereunto.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, the <hi>causes of his Maiesties, now resuming the
<pb facs="5"/>same and therein the conuenience thereof,</hi> and then to touch <hi>the forme of proceeding and debatements had in bringing the same to resolution,</hi> from all which, <hi>satisfaction</hi> is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly presented, vpon what <hi>iust, weighty, and considerable reasons</hi> his Maiestie hath <hi>restored</hi> to his Crowne, and <hi>resumed</hi> CAMBIVM REGIS, or his Office of <hi>Exchange Royall.</hi>
