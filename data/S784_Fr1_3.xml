<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> travelling towards our <hi>celestiall Countrey.</hi> We are as <hi>Sailers,</hi> bound for the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> But we must <hi>runne</hi> through many <hi>troubles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can come to our <hi>journeys end:</hi> We must <hi>sail</hi> through <hi>salt</hi> and <hi>bitter waters,</hi> and <hi>passe</hi> through the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can come to <hi>Land.</hi> There is a Land which is called <hi>The Land of the living;</hi> and there is a Land which is called <hi>The Land of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Despair:</hi> There is a <hi>two-fold Eternitie;</hi> either of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> or of the <hi>Cursed:</hi> There is a <hi>two-fold Life,</hi> after <hi>Death;</hi> either in <hi>Eternall joyes,</hi> or <hi>Eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</hi> It is good therefore in this <hi>short Life,</hi> to think upon <hi>that Life which never shall have end:</hi> It is good whilest we are on the way to think upon our <hi>Journeys end:</hi> It is good in <hi>Time,</hi> whilest we are sailing, to have an eye still upon our <hi>Compasse,</hi> and think upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> To think upon <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> is a <hi>Soveraigne Preservative</hi> to keep us from falling into <hi>Sinne:</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
To think upon <hi>Eternall joyes,</hi> sweetens the <hi>salt</hi> and <hi>bitter waters</hi> of <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Afflictions:</hi> To think upon <hi>Eternall punishments,</hi> makes us not to set our hearts upon <hi>Temporall Delights</hi> and <hi>Pleasures. Heaven</hi> is even here on <hi>Earth</hi> in part <hi>enjoyed,</hi> whilest we <hi>raise</hi> up our <hi>thoughts</hi> to <hi>meditate</hi> upon it: And <hi>Hell</hi> may for ever be escaped, if by serious and frequent <hi>thoughts</hi> thereof, here in this life, we <hi>descend</hi> into it. Such <hi>thoughts</hi> as these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Drexelius</hi> to write these <hi>CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDERATIONS,</hi> and me also to translate them. He wrote upon a <hi>Generall subject;</hi> And every man may challenge <hi>a part</hi> in it. What he wrote, he intended for a publick benefit; And so did I in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of it. I hope <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His</hi> shall finde never the worse entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because <hi>He</hi> is a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and come from beyond seas. It is the honour of our Nation, to be kinde and courteous unto <hi>Strangers.</hi> He was commended unto me by a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, a most religious and learned Gentleman (Be not angry with me,
<pb facs="5"/>
M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Benlowes,</hi> if I say, He was as like you as can be in every respect; For indeed he was) bred and brought up in the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and sent beyond seas to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, but yet brought home again by divine providence and restored to his <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for the <hi>Conversion,</hi> I hope, of many, singled out of all his kindred to be a most <hi>zealous Protestant,</hi> born to good <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and yet not given to <hi>Pleasures,</hi> wedded to his <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> spending what some call idle time in the best companie for the edifying himself or others; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing good which he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth but onely that which he doth good withall; taking more care to lay out his money for the good of others, then others, in laying up money for themselves. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, A Gentleman of whom I may most truely say, That his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> is <hi>in heaven,</hi> his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> on <hi>things above,</hi> and his <hi>thoughts</hi> upon <hi>Eternitie.</hi> Upon such a mans commendation as this,
<pb facs="5"/>
I could not but take a liking to the party commended, and the more I grew acquainted with him, the more I liked him. It is the counsell of <hi>Horace,</hi>
      <q>
         <l>Tu quem commendes etiam atque etiam aspice: nè mox</l>
         <l>Incutiant aliena tibi commissa pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorem.</l>

   <p>Beleeve me, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Benlowes,</hi> I have had such experience of this party, whom here I commend unto you, that I dare confidently say, If you entertain him into your service, you shall never repent you of it. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> appointed one every Morning to salute him with a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> of <hi>Mortalitie: Drexelius</hi> his office shall be, if you please, To be your <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> and every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Noon, and Evening, to round you in the eare with a <hi>Memento</hi> of <hi>Eternitie.</hi> But, I know, That is so often in your thoughts, that you need not any to put you in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it. Neither yet do I intend here, though I have a fair
<pb facs="6"/>
occasion, to run over the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of your <hi>Christian Vertues,</hi> specially that pair of Christian twins, your <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> with your <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Bounty.</hi> For the first, they that daily converse with you cannot but see how you converse with them. The other pair go along with you wheresoever you go, and though you desire to hide them, cannot be concealed: in speciall many poore Scholars, <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Ministers</hi> in the <hi>Universitie,</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> of severall <hi>Colledges,</hi> have had a feeling themselves of them, and cannot but make them conspicuous nay palpable to others. These shall praise you in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: for my part, I do not love to praise a man to his face. But if the <hi>living</hi> hold their peace, the <hi>dead</hi> shall rise up and praise you, I mean those <hi>many</hi> and <hi>excellent books</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other <hi>rare monuments</hi> purchased at a great price, which without any sollicitation at all, out of meere affection you bore to Saint <hi>Johns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where you were sometimes a <hi>Student,</hi> you
<pb facs="6"/>
have bestowed on their <hi>Librarie:</hi> Their <hi>Librarie,</hi> but the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent work, and <hi>Eternall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi> of the <hi>Mecoenas</hi> of our age, <hi>John Lord Bishop of Lincoln,</hi> the true lover of learning, and Patron of Scholars. And now it appeares, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Benlowes,</hi> that you have lesse need of <hi>Drexelius</hi> his service, then before. But howsoever, I pray you, entertain him: Let him have but the honour to weare your <hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance:</hi> And both <hi>He</hi> and <hi>I</hi> will put it upon the file of <hi>Thankfull Remembrance,</hi> and register it for a singular act of your <hi>Beneficence.</hi> Pardon my boldnesse in this▪ And command me in what liberall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you please.</p>
