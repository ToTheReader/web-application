      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the preaching of the
Gospell of Christ was not,
nor is, the least gift of
grace that God gaue vnto
his Church; but euen the
greatest miracle that euer
Christ wrought hecre on
earth, for our Conuersion
vnto the<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 11. 6.</note> faith: So the
abuse of this grace is not
the least, but the greatest
sinne, that can be committed. The which being truly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
<pb facs="3"/>
I maruell not a little?<note place="margin">3. Ep. Ioh. v. 9.</note> why <hi>Diotrephes</hi> with his
Schollers will persist in resisting of this grace; or <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> with his Champions continue in purchasing of this
grace;<note place="margin">Act. 8. 18.</note> or <hi>Iudas</hi> with his Successors perseuer in buying and
selling of Christ Spouse the <hi>Church,</hi> contrarie to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of grace. But forasmuch as that I minde not in this
ensuing Treatise to tax them,<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 15.</note> or their wicked abuses: Yet
my prayers vnto God for them shalbee; to turne their
hearts from farther renting of the garments of <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Church,</hi> least they become like vnto these their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
partakers not of the least grace.</p>
   <p>The subiect or matter, wherewith I am now to present
your Worships withall: is touching the mysterie of <hi>Christ</hi>
his Natiuitie. The Text hath beene handed often, and by
manie; Yea and of such men, who for their great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
reading, wittie inuention, and profound Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
haue manie degrees exceeded my selfe. Yet to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the earnest and godly requests of some of my especiall
good friends, I haue enterprised, and aduentured, to set
forth the same in print: hoping that your Worshippes will
vouchsafe to giue it the perusall, and accept these the
first fruits of my labours, with the selfe-same affection
wherwith it is offered; how smal and simple soeuer it seeme
to be. And now the Lord Iesus giue it his grace, that it may
not be like firekinled on his Altar in vaine;<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 9.</note> but that it may
proue to bee as the morning Incense, and as euening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
acceptable vnto God, and profitable vnto this
Church.</p>
   <p>Vnto the same God will I pray alwayes to powre downe
<pb facs="3"/>
his mercies vpon you, to enrich you with his graces,
and to preserue your Worships for the good
both of Church and Common-wealth,
vnto his glorie
AMEN.</p>
