   <head>The Preface of the Authour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here haue ben many before me, who to know the miracles of the worlde, haue with diligent studie read dyuers Authours which haue written of such thinges. But other giuing more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to the lyuely voyce, haue been more desirous to know the same by relation of such as haue traueyled in those countreys, &amp; seene such thinges whereof they make relation, for that in many bookes, geathered of vncertaine aucthoritie, are myxt false thinges with true. Other there are so greatly desirous to know the trueth of these thinges, that they can in no wyse be satisfied, vntyll by theyr owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they haue founde the trueth, by voyages and peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into straunge countreys and people, to know theyr maners, fashions, and customes, with dyuers thinges there to be seene: wherein, the only readyng of bookes, could not satisfie their thirst of suche knowledge, but rather increased the same, in so much that they feared not with losse of goods and daunger of lyfe to attempte great vyages to dyuers countreys, with witnesse of theyr eyes to see that they so greatly desired to knowe. The whiche thyng among other chaunced vnto me also. For as often as in the bookes of hystories and Cosmographie, I read of such marueylous thinges whereof they make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (especially of thinges in the East partes of the world) there was nothyng that coulde pacifie my vnquiet mynde, vntyll I had with myne eyes seene the trueth thereof. I knowe that some there are indued with hygh knowledge, mountyng vnto the heauens, whiche will contempne these our writinges, as base and humble, bycause we doe not here, after their maner, with high and subtile inquisition intreate of the motions and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the starres, and gyue reason of theyr woorkyng on the earth, with their motions, retrogradations, directions, mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, epicicles, reuolutions, inclinations, diuinations, reflexions,
<pb n="355" facs="365"/>
and suche other parteynyng to the science of Astrologie: which certeynely we doe not condempne, but greatly prayse. But mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suryng vs with our owne foote, we will leaue that heauie burden of heauen to the strong shoulders of Atlas and Hercules: and only creepyng vppon the earth, in our owne person beholde the situations of landes and regions, with the maners and customes of men, and variable fourmes, shapes, natures, and propriettes of beastes, fruites, and trees, especially suche as are among the <hi>Arabians, Persians, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> And whereas in the searchyng of these thinges, we haue (thanked be God) satisfied our desire, we thinke neuerthelesse that we haue done little, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte we should communicate to other, such thinges as we haue seene and had experience of, that they lykewyse by the readyng thereof, may take pleasure, for whose sakes we haue written this long and dangerous discourse, of thinges which we haue seene in dyuers regions and sectes of men, desiryng nothyng more then that the trueth may be knowen to them that desyre the same. But what incommodities and troubles chaunced vnto me in these viages, as hunger, thirst, colde, heate, warres, captiuitie, terrours, and dyuers other suche daungers, I will declare by the way in theyr due pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
