But as yet vnto my poore iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (semynge to be a thynge very moche requysite) for the more effectuall and spedy furtherance of your graces sayd youth, I wyshed, that vnto this moch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient reformation of your schole maisters vnstayd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap>, which hytherto haue taught such grammers, and of the same so dyuers and sondry sortes, as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of theym semed best (and was to their fantasies mooste approued: myght therto also folowe and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede one stedy and vnyforme maner of interpretation


<pb facs="3"/>
of the latyn authours into our tonge, after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the latyn principles were by your graces youth ones surely con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and perceyued. Upon the want and defaute wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, besydes the great and euydente inconuenience (of whiche the effecte is to moche in euerye place espied) that is to say, the playnly apparant ignorance &amp; want of a required sufficiencye of many, whiche in priuate places take vpon theym to teache, afore they be theyr craftes maisters. To whome the beste grammaticall rules, that euer were or could be deuised, can not vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably be sufficient: I haue by experyence lerned, that there be dyuers other occasions, rysynge vppon the schole maisters parties, wherby your graces youth is not a lyttell hyndered. For some instructers of youre hyghnes youth, for want of a perfyte iudgement in this behalfe, so moche desyre to seme affectately curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse, that hauyng no due consyderation to the tender wyttes, whiche they take vnder theyr charge to teache in the stede of pure englyshe wordes and phrases, they declare to their chylderne one latyne worde by an no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and confounde the phrases of the tongues: And thus not a lytell do hynder their yong scholers, while they wold seme for their own partes to haue a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and erudition aboue the common sort. And som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other ageyne there be, whiche hauynge vndoubtedly, lernyng ynoughe, vaylable and sufficiente, yet whyle they by sondry wayes and maners of speakynge vsed in our tongue, labour to expresse such latyn auctours myndes, as they do take vppon them for the tyme to interprefe, and for to seme therin more dilygent, than the cōmon sorte, dyspende in manerhole forenoones and afternoones, in the declarynge of a fewe lynes of


<pb facs="4"/>
suche latyne authours, as they for the season haue in hande (as to confesse the very truthe, the schole mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hole dilygence tendeth in maner chiefely to that effecte and purpose) they do by that meanes not only ryght lytell for the tyme further their yong audience, but also by that wayes do oppresse and ouerlaye the tender wyttes, the whiche they wold so fayne further, with their multitude of sondry interpretations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly by them vttered. So that fynally theyr yong scholers, to helpe their memory with, be forced to falle a glosynge, or rather a blottyng of their latyn bokes, and as theyr chyldyshe iudgement dothe for the tyme serue them, of dyuers englishe wordes in our tongue beinge synonymes, or of dyuers maners of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vsed by theyr mayster, they chuse moste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the very worste, and therewith scryble the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of theyr latyne auctours. And somme other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore there be, whiche thoughe they haue by their greatte studye, at youre graces Unyuersyties, soo moche prouffyted in the Latyne tongue, that to shewe an euydente tryalle of theyr lernynge, they canne wryte an Epistle ryght latyne lyke, and therto speake latyne, as the tyme shall mynyster occasyon, very well, yea and haue also by theyr diligence attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a comly vayne in makynge of verses: yet for all this, partely bycause of the rude language vsed in their natyue countreyes, where they were borne and firste lerned (as it happened) their grammer rules, &amp; partely bycause that commyng streyght from thense, vnto some of your graces vniuersities, they haue not had occasions to be conuersaunte in suche places of your realme, as the pureste englysshe is spoken, they


<pb facs="4"/>
be not able to expresse theyr conceyte in theyr vulgar tonge, ne be not suffycyente, perfectly to open the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities of phrases betwene our tonge and the latyn (whiche in my poore iudgemente is the veray chiefe thynge that the schole mayster shulde trauayle in) In so moche that for want of this sufficient perfection in our owne tongue, I haue knowen dyuerse of theym, which haue styl continued theyr study in some of your graces vniuersities, that after a substanciall encrease of good lernynge, by theyr great and industrious stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obteyned, yet whan they haue ben called to do any seruice in your graces cōmen welthe, eyther to preach in open audience, or to haue other administration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiringe theyr assiduous conuersantynge with your subiectes, they haue then ben forced to rede ouer our englyshe auctours, by that meanes to prouyde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy vnto their euident imperfection in that behalfe. And when it hath fortuned any suche for theyr good name and estimation to be called from your vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, to instructe any of your graces noble mennes chyldren, then euidently hath appered their imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that case to be notable, and that to no smal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and hinderaunce of suche as they haue taken charge to enstruct and brynge forwarde. Being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for my parte desyrous, that these inconueniences myght also be prouided for, and thervpon takyng, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, more attentiuely to bethynke me vppon this matter, than began the great difficultie of the wel at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuinge therof, the more playnly to appere vnto me, not onely bycause the lyke thyng hath not yet hyther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (that euer I coulde knowe of) ben throughely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted of anye clerke within this your gracis noble


<pb facs="5"/>
realme, but also for so moche, as that to be <hi>Ecphrastes</hi> in theyr mother tonge, vpon any laten autours, hath neuer hitherto (so farre as I can yet perceyue) ben as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saied in any other regiō of Europa: except perchance that some such as be lettered, haue for theyr owne ease and the more briefe and spedye furtheraunce of theyr scholers, vsed suche kynde of interpretation in theyr owne tonge vpon some excellent latyn auctour, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they wolde neuer suffre to passe the boundes of theyr priuate houses. The not attemptynge of which kynde of interpretation in other regions, hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceded of any notable perfection or furderaunce, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the other regions haue in theyr langages, ouer &amp; beyonde your noble graces subiectes. For how moch the phrase of the frenche tongue is different from the pure latinitie, maye appere by a booke of late yeres made by Robertus Stephanus, whiche he entitleth, <hi>De corrupte sermonis emendatione.</hi> And howe moche the Spaynes be with this self imperfectiō intached, may appere by the restimony of Nebrisensis, whiche with many wordes doth lament the notable corruption of the latyne tonge amongest his countrey men, rysyng vpon this occasion, and ernestly doth exhorte them to be more diligent in thobseruynge of the perfecte and approued laten auctours. And as for the Germaynes not withstanding the great excellency that they nowe at these dayes be come vnto, yet is there no doubte, but that there is noo vulgar phrase vsed within the boundes of Europa, that more swarueth from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte latinitie, than this dothe. So that whan I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, by howe ernest maner Bebelius called vpon the Germaynes, to leaue theyr owne phrase, and to take


<pb facs="5"/>
them to the assiduous readynge and obseruyng of the good latyne auctours, the whiche was but a lyttel be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Rheuclines dayes, and howe prosperousely the thynge hath syns that tyme amongest them succeded, I take, that Bebelius was in maner to the Germay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as was Laurence Ualla vnto the Italians, by whose fyrste exhortation and settynge on, so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wryters haue rysen amongeste the Italians within the tyme of memory. Beinge therfore in this behalfe not a lyttell perplexed, whether I might be so bolde, to assay howe this thynge myght take effecte, if it shulde fortune by me to be attempted, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto your noble graces hye counsaylour, and euer my synguler good lorde, the lorde priuye seale, vnto whom as the tyme and place dyd serue me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my pore desire, and with right humble instance besieched hym, that I myght (to make a triall of this my purpose) dedicate some latyne auctour interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after this maner, whiche I haue here described, to his lordeshyppe, not onely to make a profe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the thynge, whiche I so moche mynded, but alsoo to be a testimonye, and a recognysynge on my partie, towardes his lordeshyppe, of the manyfolde and syngular humanities shewed vnto me, and that of no small continuance of yeres. But his lordeshyp wylled me expressely, therto addynge bothe a ryghte wyse and also honeste consyderation, to dedicate my poore labours vnto your noble grace, my moste drad and mooste redoubted soueraygne lorde, wherby my great sollicitude and care is nowe moch more redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, than euer it was before, lest I shuld in any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner case offend, where I wold faynest my tendre zeale


<pb facs="6"/>
shulde accordynge as I do meane, moste euidentelye and fruitefully appere. Howe be it callynge in this behalfe good hope vnto me, for the manyfolde experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that I haue had, in the great clemency and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie, whiche I haue euer founde in your noble grace, I haue chosen for my latten authour, to be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes vppon, the comedie entiteled <hi>A colastus,</hi> not onely for bycause that I esteme that lyttell volume to be a very curiouse and artificiall compacted nosegay, gathered out of the moche excellent and odoriferouse swete smellynge gardeynes of the moste pure latyne auctours, but also bycause that the maker therof (as farre as I can lerne) is yet lyuing, wherby I wold be glad to moue into the hartes of your graces clerkes, of whiche your noble realme was neuer better stored, some lyttell grayne of honeste and vertuous enuye, whiche on my partie to confesse the verye truthe vnto your grace, hath contynually in all the tyme of these my poore labours takyng, accompanyed me, and sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me onwardes to achieue this matter, on this wise by me attemted. For thus haue I thought to my self. Shal Fullomus an Hollander born, thus many hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred yeres, after the decay of the latyne tongue by the Gothes, Uandales, and Longobardes. iii. moste bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, vtterly corrupted, through the dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obseruation of the pure latyn authors, be able to make so fyne and so exact a pece of worke: And I shal not be able at these yeres of myn age, to do so moche, as to declare what he meaneth, in my natyue tongue? Seing that he (regard had to his countrey) can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no more propretie of the latyne tongue, than I can, sauynge that through his great and industrious


<pb facs="6"/>
labour, he hath maystered the latinitie, and forced it to serue hym, to set forthe to all clerkes his intent and purpose. Thus do I, my moste redoubted soueraine lord, speke to your grace, whose pure and clere iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment I oughte moste hyghly to feare, as thoughe I were fully persuaded to my selfe, that I haue not all holy dispent my labours in vayne. But in very dede I shall thynke my selfe not onely very well suffised, but also moche fortunate, if this myne enterprise, or at the least fyrst settynge on, maye gyue occasion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other your graces wel lerned clerkes, to fal in hāde with suche of the latyne auctours, as in the iudgemēt of all men be most excellent, and to this purpose most necessary and expedient. So that by theyr dilygente labours may be made suche an establyshed mariage, betwene the two tonges, as may be vnto such of your graces subiectes, as shall succede hereafter, not only stedy, agreed vpon, and parmanent, but also an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible furtheraunce, to atteyn the pure latinitie by. So that thoughe I haue not obteyned to the thinge, which I haue desired, yet do I humbly wishe of god, that myne ignoraunce and imperfection shulde be no maner hynderance, to stop that the thinges self shuld not go forwarde, and take his prosperous effect. For howe so euer Minerua hath assisted and ayded me to my iourneys end, yet styl to persist in the opening vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your noble grace of my poore and symple iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this behalfe, I suppose veryly that amonge diuerse other profytes and aduancementes of your graces subiectes towardes good lernyng, there shuld syxe great and moche vaylable commodities of this thyng ensue. Fyrst, for if this kynde of interpretation


<pb facs="7"/>
maye take effecte, and be put in execution, not onely the speache of your graces subiectes shoulde by that meane haue a great aduauntage to waxe vniforme, throughe out all your graces domynions, but also the englysshe tonge, whiche vnder your graces pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouse reygne is comme to the hygheste perfection that euer hytherto it was, shulde by this occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne more stedy and parmanent in his endurance, not onely by the well kepynge of his perfection alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obteyned, but also haue a great occasion to come to his most hyghest estate, and there, by that meanes longe to be preserued. Seconde, for after this, there shulde neuer be no vtter yll schole maysters within your graces realme. for if suche as wolde take vpon them that offyce, were not better then theyr englyshe interpretations, yet very shame wolde dryue theym, that they shulde not be worse, excepte they wold stand in danger to be reproued of their owne scholers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if they were but yonge babes, yet might their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes casily controlle theym, whiche myght welle y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough perceiue, whā they did notably amysse. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for than shulde the wyllynge scolers, whiche hadde all redy gotten their grammaticall principles, be so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently encouraged to go forwarde, that they shulde be great callers vpon theyr felowes, whiche by theyr negligence wolde dragge, besydes that the maysters them selfes shulde haue no small prouocation, to vse for theyr owne parties a good dylygence, leste theyr scholers of theyr owne mynde shulde call for more of theyr au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tour to be declared vnto thē, then perchance they had prepared to reade vnto them before: where as nowe the scholers, be they neuer so well wyllynge


<pb facs="7"/>
to be furthered, they haue no maner remedy, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and holly to staye vpon theyr maysters mouthe. Fourthely, for than shulde all suche as be alredy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the grammer scholes, and afterwarde be taken with a repentāce of theyr yong time negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them ouerpassed, whiche aforetyme were forced to dispayre, thoughe theyr wylles afterwarde wared neuer so good, nowe by this meanes caselye recouer them selfes agayne. Fyftely, for than shulde younge scholers, with small paynes, engrose the hole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the latten autours in theyr memory, where as heretofore, after they haue redde the latyne auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in the schole, they haue not perceiued what mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter they entreated of: yea and than theyr furtherance and spedy encrease shoulde be soo notable, that with pleasure in maner, and with bannyshynge of all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile rudenes out of grammer scholes, they shulde so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be able perfytely to go, then they coulde afore ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes be able to creepe. Syxtely, for whan the schole maysters, and also the scholers, shuld by this meanes be eased in maner of. iii. partes of theyr paynes, than shuld the masters haue both tyme and better occasiō, to open theyr farder lerning, &amp; to shew vnto theyr scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers the great artifice vsed of the auctors, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of theyr workis, which afore time they had no suche oportunitie to do. But what meane I my most redoubted soueraygne lorde, which knowyng the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable clerenesse of your graces iudgemente, seme here to be thus farre abused, as to be about to shewe lyght vnto the bryght shynynge sonne?
