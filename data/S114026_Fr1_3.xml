      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE endeuoured (gentle Reader) to set downe the principall pointes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, in as plaine sorte as I coulde possible: for their sakes especially, whose capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are small, and memories vnable to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine much. If I haue attained that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I attempted (that is to say, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite) I haue my desire: If otherwise▪ then although my worke deserue no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> prayse (which if it did, were due onely to God) yet my will desireth pardon, whiche I doe not doubt to obteine at thy handes, seeing I seeke nothing but thy aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The excuses that are dayly made for ignorance, while one layeth the fault in his want of time, an other in his simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and want of capacitie, and others in want of memorie, &amp;c. did much moue me to trie what I coulde doe, to doe them good: although I am not ignorant, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also haue gone about the same. But such is the dulnesse of our dayes, and so hard is it to be both short and yet playne,
<pb facs="3"/>
in so great matters, that it is well, if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their or my labour, or all that we all can doe, may bring men forwarde in the faith. If wee misse this, yet because wee meane it, he that is not vncharitably sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, will not thinke the labour super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. If this come to the hands of such, as are already past such A. B. Cees▪ let it not offend them, that children are ledde, though they beeing men can goe alone. And let them leaue this, eyther to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in yeares or in knowledge: whiche must of necessitie be trained vp in this, or such short and plaine sorte, if they will profit, as I pray God they may, and wee all euerie day increase in knowledge, and growe in the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ, who euer preserue you, &amp; to whome be prayse in the Church through all generations for euer.</p>
