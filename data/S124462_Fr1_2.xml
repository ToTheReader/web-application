For which purpose, nothing is so necessarie, as alwayes to haue prest and readie in our hands, the word of God, thereby on euery side, so to strengthen our faith, which the diuell would tame and batter, as we see our Sauiour Christ did, who by this meanes sent Sathan away, confounded, and ashamed, which came to tempt him in the wildernesse. And questionlesse, it is a thing vndoubtedly true, that faith being propped and grounded vpon such sure rockes, as are the promises of God, and of Iesus Christ, who is the keeper &amp; treasurer thereof, can neuer be mastered nor subdued, what blowes and stormes soeuer the diuell, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this is the verie reason which hath led me to write this little treatise, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it, comfort for the sicke, where I haue briefely collected and alledged such places of scripture, as seeme vnto me to be most fit for the deducting and handling of this matter and argument. If it may profite and edifie the church of God, it is all that that I desire for my labour, and which I pretended and aimed at in the writing thereof.</p>
