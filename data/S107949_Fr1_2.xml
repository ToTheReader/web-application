      </gap>imitated the Beloued of the Espouse, in preferring before althings his blessed choice of Myrrhe, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during so many pressures, for the loue and imitation of him,<note place="margin">The reason of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</note> and the defence of his Truth; (which state of yours being that of persecution, may well be
<pb facs="4"/> tearmed a certayne state of perfection) me thinkes I behold the Espouse inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you also to come into her Garden, knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready your choice to be so like vnto that of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</p>
   <p>That Garden of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection this small Volume resembleth, in which are with order disposed, the admirable perfectiōs both of the Espouse and her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued: &amp; although those of her Beloued giue forth a clearer light, and are of
<pb facs="4"/> greater ornament to this place then those of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse; yet here it is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued his will (seeking to honour her) to call this Garden hers, &amp; by adding his graces vnto it, to make his Espouses worthines the more apparent.</p>
   <p>Enter therfore with al confidence (being so louin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly inuited) <hi>into this Garden of our B. Lady,</hi> in which your interest is so great: view, and with all attention behold the natiue beauties and the fruites that are in
<pb facs="5"/> it so delightfull,<note place="margin">Our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once rectified our end ought euer to be in sight.</note> see what pleasant pathes are heere plained forth, how streight they are, &amp; without tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; at euery entrance wherof, the end is most clearly discouered. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssages of this nature are many, and diuersly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: in some you shall find diuine Loue leading the B. Virgin to the Tēple in Hierusalem to consecrat her selfe vnto perpetuall virginity; in others you shall behold her (condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the same guide) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="5"/> to giue her consent to become the mother of the Sauiour of the world; here she is in her iourny to visit her Cosin <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by her presence to make holy the fruite of her wombe; in these pathes she reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and mourneth, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and reioyceth, diuine loue producing in her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest hart diuine effects.</p>
   <p>But besides these most euen and direct passages (Loue being the contriuer of this Paradise) there are pleasant descents, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="6"/> againe into mounts, keep correspondence one with the other; in these descents you may behold the Virgin as an humble handmayd going towards Bethleem, to bring forth her glorious Infant poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, flying into Egipt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, seeking her lost Iesus amongst her kindred care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and following her tormented Iesus vnto his death most dolefully. But in the ascent or rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the things you are to see are farre different:
<pb facs="6"/> for diuine Loue hauing out of the descent redoubled the Virgins forces,<note place="margin">The humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the B V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>To giue you a full de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scription of this Garden,
<pb facs="7"/> and to tell you, what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,<note place="margin">Figures of the B.

This only requesting at your hands,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> that those things in which this Gardē shall seeme pleasing vnto you, &amp; by which your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections shalbe any
<pb facs="7"/> way moued, you would seeke by imitation to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them into your owne Gardens, wherby you shal make your entring into it, not pleasant alone, but withall most profitable.</p>
