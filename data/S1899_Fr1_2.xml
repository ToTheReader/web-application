      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is the dutie of every Christian to imploy himselfe for the setting forth of Gods glory, and not with the unprofitable servant to hide his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a napkin; So I considering how in these dayes so great and important a dutie as prayer, is much neglected and under-valued: haue thought good (for the propagating of Gods glory the increasing of Christian devotion, and the inciting of every one to the frequent practice of so necessary a dutie) to bring into the world this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>Treatise:</hi> which hath a great while beene in private hands (and so had remained by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors good will) but now at length by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of friends hath prevailed to come into the light for the generall good of all, which is the end and utmost ayme of him that wrote it, in this as in the rest to propagate Gods glory, and stirre up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to the more fervent and frequent use of this dutie, in which we praise God for his blessings that he hath extended towards us, and pray to God for those defects which we finde in our selues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be supplyed withall. And so may serue very fitly as a key, to let us into all the roomes of Gods
<pb facs="3"/> Treasury and Store-house, where wee may be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully supplyed with all good things which we stand in need of. But least that I should seeme tedious to your Christian patience, in detaining you too long from the worke; or that I may be thought to thrust my sickle into another mans harvest, and so reape where I haue not sowen: I rest; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine assistance for his grace, to make a right use of all his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, through his Sonne our Saviour Iesus Christ.</p>
