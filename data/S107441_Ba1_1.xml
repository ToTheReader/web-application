   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Sermons beeing
committed to my care,
to be printed, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Author (by
meanes of the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sicknes in London:)
I am to intreate thee (curteous Reader) to
bear with such defects or defaults, as haue
passed the Presse, either through my own,
or the workmens ouersight. Wherein, no
maruaile if we might be ouertaken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the closenesse of the Copie, and
the same not re-written, but deliuered
vnto vs as he did set it downe at the first
draught, (ouer-running his noates) and
referring vs by signes and markes to
displaced: wherein (peraduenture) wee
haue not rightly traced him, or discried
his directions in euerie place.</p>
   <p>This I thought good to prefix in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb facs="147"/>
of the <hi>forme:</hi> but as for the <hi>matter</hi>
of the Booke, it is able to speake for it
selfe, and that in such sort, as I doubt
not, will preuaile with such as feare God,
and which can discerne betweene badde
<hi>Bookes</hi> or paltrie <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> (which haue
of late pestered the land) and betweene
sound <hi>Sermons,</hi> or profitable <hi>Treatises</hi>
that carrie their waight with them, and
serue substantially for the building and
beautifying of the Lords house.</p>
   <p>As this Booke is thus able to vouch
testimonie for it selfe, out of God his
most holie Oracles: so I can beare this
witnesse vnto it: that being in <hi>Kent</hi> when
the most of these Sermons were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
I haue heard them commended, and
God thanked for the Authour, by such,
as whose hearts, I perceyued, were tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
nay, much mooued at the hearing
of them.</p>
   <p>And further, touching the man; (sith
I am indyting this Preface without his
priuitie, and writing not to claw him,
whereby nought can bee gained; nor to
giue <hi>Tytles</hi> to men, to whom belongs
nothing but shame; but to gaine glorie
to God, to whom all praise is due, for
<pb facs="147"/>
raising vp such instruments to the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the ministerie, and building vp of
his Saints:) I say, touching the man,
this I may truly, and not to no purpose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
that hee comming from <hi>Emanuell
Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> (for want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
(as I suppose) euen in his young
yeares, before hee was ripe: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(as himselfe reporteth in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Dedicatorie going before) spending
some yeares (and those not vnprofitably:)
as appeareth: when, after that, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himselfe to the Ministerie, and
was newly (young, as yet) entered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
and placed at <hi>Wie</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where
now he is: he seemed to haue the thoughts
of <hi>Moses,</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 4. 10, 13.</note>
      <hi>I am not eloquent,</hi> send whom
thou wilt, &amp;c: and of <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 1. 6.</note>
      <hi>I cannot
speake I am a child:</hi> and of <hi>Paule:</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note>
      <hi>Who
is sufficient for these things?</hi> The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof, not onely mooued, but
euen enforced him to fall roundly to
his studie, and hauing gotten good
Bookes about him; hee so laboured
therein, rising earlie, and sitting vp late,
adioyning also practise of continuall
preaching to his set order of reading:
as that in short time hee ouer-tooke such
<pb facs="148"/>
as in those parts had beene before him in
Christ, and had been accounted chiefe in
the labours of the Gospell: yea, hee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the proceedings of many, who stay
longer, &amp; take further degrees of schooles
in the Vniuersities.</p>
   <p>And thus becomming a man well
knowne for sufficiencie, was called vpon
to make one in the combination at <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where for the space of certaine years
he hath kept his course, as his turne came
about, with credite, and like a good ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
brought forth those things <hi>both new
and old,</hi> where with hee had before furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
himselfe in his priuate studies, and
by his publike and painfull preaching in
his more priuate Congregation: so much
of the man.</p>
   <p>Concerning his manner of preaching
at the first: I haue then noted, and since
heard himselfe acknowledge it, that it
was somewhat <hi>conceipted</hi> and <hi>fantasticall,</hi>
sauouring more of <hi>Wit</hi> then of <hi>Wisedome,</hi>
stuft with humane learning, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(withall) some flowers of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
out of <hi>Hibernicus,</hi> pleasing also himselfe
many times with wittie <hi>Alligories.</hi> And
(to be short) taking a course more <hi>painfull</hi>
      <pb facs="148"/>
then <hi>profitable.</hi> Now, these his Sermons
shew what he hath read, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
not either the <hi>Schoole-men,</hi> or
the old or new <hi>Writers,</hi> no, nor the
<hi>Humanitans</hi> themselues, as hee hath
beene challenged: yet this I can say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
that hee shewes himselfe more
plentifull (by making shew hereof) in
this his penned <hi>Treatise,</hi> then hee was
in the Pulpit, in preaching of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
The which no doubt he hath done
with aduised iudgement, considering that
a man may (by reading) at leysure, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sentence and sense of an <hi>Authour</hi>
alledged; which (in hearing) on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
(especially if it be cited in a strange
tongue) he can not doe, without finding
his attention therewithall much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Againe, if a Preacher were bound
to cite authoritie for all that he speakes;
hee should neuer haue done; for, as the
Wise man saith, <hi>What is it, whereof man
may say, behold this is new:</hi> so also, we may
often say, <hi>Nihil iam dictum, quod non die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
prius.</hi> Yea further, I do not see (for
my part) any such profite in the great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie
of some (of late much practised)
in quoting chapter and verse so thicke
<pb facs="149"/>
and three-fold as they doe, no not out of
the holy Scriptures themselues. For it
may be obserued, that our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his Apostles are oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to quoate at large, not citing so
much as the Psalme or Chapter whence
they alledge (much lesse the Verse:) but
pointing as it were, to the place; they
presently bend themsleues to make vse
of it, according to the purpose they haue
in hand, as in Math. 4. 10. Iohn 7. 38. Ro.
9. 25. Rom. 10. 15. Rom. 11. 26. Heb.
2. 6. Iam. 4. 4. In many of which places
we may also obserue, the sence, rather
than the words, to be alleadged, yea, the
sence also, sometimes rather collected,
than expressed. And so also Master <hi>Caluin</hi>
(a man pregnant in the Text) verie
often in his writings, doth in such sort
quoat and cite the Scriptures. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Author of these Sermons, as he
hath changed his first kind of preaching
(as I said) into a better method: so also
in his present manner of handling the
word, he is not so plentifull in alleadging
places, as in this his treatise hee hath set
downe. By which his course and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the labours of his ministrie, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="149"/>
his peoples good, not his glory) what
good hath been don in his charge, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into good <hi>compasse,</hi> that people, which
not many yeeres agoe were out of <hi>square:</hi>
I had rather ye should find it in M. <hi>Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
Treatise,</hi> of<note n="*" place="margin">Or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</note>
      <hi>the Gospels prosperous
successe,</hi> than read it reported by my pen.</p>
   <p>Onely this in this place I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that these paines in studie and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ouersight in teaching and gouerning
the people committed to his charge, hee
hath imployed in a place, where both
Parsonage and Vicaredge being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate,
swallowed downe into the gulfe
of those <hi>High places</hi> that sometimes
stood in this land, (as this was into the
Abbey of <hi>Battell:</hi>) the stinted allowance
for this mans maintenance, after all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcations
(the fat offerings for the priests
who in those dayes liued, being now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
is xvii. pound by the yeare, and no
more, the rest is supplied by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
wherein I cannot but commend
both Preacher and people; the one for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contented with such allowance as is
made; the other for extending so farre as
they doe. But my hope is, that ere it be
long, some good order will bee taken
<pb facs="150"/>
whereby Preacher and people, (both in
this place and many others) shall bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
prouided for; the one secured
with a certaine or standing stipend, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
freed from a chargeable contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which comes the more vnwillingly
from them, by meanes they are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit
the more eased, from yeelding their
impropriate, both great and small <hi>tythes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In which regard, heere fitly commeth
to be had in thankefull and honourable
remembrance, the <hi>Royall bountie</hi> of our
late Soueraigne and gracious Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
who at the instance of that most
worthie, religious, and deepely prudent
Councellour, Sir <hi>Frauncis Walsingham,</hi>
Chauncelour of the Duchie of <hi>Lancaster:</hi>
was pleased to impart a large portion of
those her Reuenewes (certaine hundred
pounds) to yeeld standing yerely stipends
of Fiftie pounds a peece, to some<note n="*" place="margin">Master Midglie. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp;c.</note> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to labour in that shire, (before as it
may seeme, but slenderly prouided for in
that behalfe) which I thinke also to be the
cause that mooued this Authour (their
Countrey-man) to be so carefull of that
County, as appeareth before in his Epistle
to his friends and kinsfolks of Lancashire.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="150"/>
But to returne (and so to draw to an
end:) after hee had preached many other
Sermons at <hi>Ashford</hi> aforesaid in his seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
turnes: at last, hauing begun, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finished the 23. Psalme, in these seuen
Sermons: hee was much importuned by
many to put them in print, especially by
Master <hi>H. H.</hi> who being the first man
that gaue him certaine and full informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our late <hi>Queenes</hi> departure, and of
the Proclaming of our present most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King in London on the Thursday
before: he did so stirre him vp to fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to speake the next Saturday (being
his course to preach, which fell out to bee
the last of these Sermons) that he in such
sort spake vpon those two (the one dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the other ioyfull) occasions; as that
there was not an eie in that plentifull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of right worshipfull and others,
(met about the said Proclamation to bee
made also there;) but sent out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
testimonies of that their ioyfull-sorrow.</p>
   <p>Thus commending this booke to the
kind acceptance (the which I do the more
desire, in regard of the timerous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherewith I haue perceiued the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="151"/>
to be much oppressed, euen since hee
committed his booke to the Presse: from
which his bashfull feare, if he shall be by
the curtesie in some measure set free, hee
may be brought to impart mo of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
wherinto he hath alreadie made
some entrance:) And commending thy
selfe to the word of grace, which is able
to build thee further to an inheritance
among the Saints: I bid thee fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
