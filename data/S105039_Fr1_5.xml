   <l>IF ought amisse, you finde good Reader heere,</l>
   <l>His fault it is, that sings ne sweete nor loud:</l>
   <l>When he caught cold, and voice could not be cleere,</l>
   <l>Because ech note, is cloked vnder cloud,</l>
   <l>He cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <l>One peece nor part, of musicke any waie:</l>
   <l>Ne sembreeffe, breefe, nor yet ne larke nor long,</l>
   <l>For he hath skill, in deskant some men saie,</l>
   <l>And on the base, can make three parts in one,</l>
   <l>And set new songs, when all the old are gone.</l>
   <l>Though some beleeue, but hardly that he makes,</l>
   <l>These things or that, which seemes far past his reach,</l>
   <l>Tush though old head, and hand with paulsie shakes,</l>
   <l>Let no ill will, plaine writers pen appeach:</l>
   <l>If you do loue, no wrong giue ech man right:</l>
   <l>Rob not the iust, of any praise well won,</l>
   <l>Way not mens worth, with waights in ballance light,</l>
   <l>For truth is truth, when all is saide and don:</l>
   <l>You may as well, say white and red is blacke,</l>
   <l>And Sun and Moone, are steele and marble stone:</l>
   <l>As say or thinke, behinde a writers backe▪</l>
   <l>He borrowed that, which he claimes as his owne:</l>
   <l>O giue men leaue, to father their owne childe:</l>
   <l>Let it be foule, or faire as babies are,</l>
   <l>A stubborne boye, a cracke-rope tame or wilde,</l>
   <l>Begot in haste, and brought vp poore and bare:</l>
   <l>How ere they be, blinde, lame, or shapt awrie,</l>

   <l>(Like orphants weake, that knowes not what to do)</l>
   <l>With blessings great, and not with parents curse,</l>
   <l>That shortens life, and gets Gods anger to:</l>
   <l>Children were woont, to beare their fathers name,</l>
   <l>Not one durst say, in earnest iest or skorne,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="9"/>(To hinder childe, of spotlesse birth and fame)</l>
   <l>A lawfull sonne, was but a bastard borne.</l>
   <l>Both beast and bird, their yoong ones do defend,</l>
   <l>So shall my Muse, maintaine that I haue pend,</l>
   <l>Then bring <hi>Shores</hi> wife, in question now no more,</l>

   </q>
   <l>And as she went, like gallant lasse before,</l>
   <l>So other gyrls, as gaie and fresh as rose,</l>
   <l>With verse haue I, set foorth in sundrie sorts,</l>
   <l>As braue as she, what ere disdaine reports,</l>
   <l>That humor now, declines for age drawes on,</l>
   <l>The full tide is, of fine inuention gon:</l>
   <l>Ebbe followes floud, when vitall vaines waxe dead,</l>
   <l>Wit weares and wastes, as torch consumes with winde,</l>
   <l>When water turnes, drie growes a flowing head:</l>
   <l>In age ech thing, decaies by course of kinde:</l>
   <l>Yet whiles the oyle, in lampe may make a blaze,</l>
   <l>Or candell in, the socket shewes a light,</l>
   <l>On sparkling flame, the cleerest eies will gaze,</l>
   <l>And comfort finde, thereby in darkest night:</l>
   <l>I yeeld to time, that like a sithe cuts cleane,</l>

   <l>Though Syrens voice, the hearers doth deceaue,</l>
   <l>Mine hath no charme, but open plaine and bare,</l>
   <l>As I was borne, so speake I English still,</l>
   <l>To lose my paines, and win the worlds good will,</l>
   <l>No losse so much, as credit crackt with pen,</l>
   <l>Nor gaine so great, as loue of honest men.</l>
   <l>Fare you well.</l>
