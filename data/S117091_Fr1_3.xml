The which J had surely effected, if I had beene ouer-ruled by their requests and perswasions; alleadging strong reasons, that the common Workemen of our time little regarded or esteemed to Worke with right Simmetrie: the which is confused and erronious, in the iudgement of the Learned Architect, if they will follow the Order of Antiquities hereafter ensuing Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore least my good meaning, together with my Labour in Translating and Publishing, should not be regarded and esteemed (as worthie) considering it not onely tendeth to the great profit of the Architect or Workeman, but also generally to all other Artificers of our Nation: I aduise all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, not to deceiue themselues, nor to be selfe-conceited in their owne workes, but well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this my labour (tending to common good) and be perswaded that who so shall follow these rules hereafter set downe, shall not onely haue his Worke well esteemed of the common people, but also generally commended and applauded of all workemen, and men of iudgement. <hi>Vale.</hi>
