The intermission of those mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary imployments, which haue won you iust honor, both in forraine nations, and at home, is in this only gainefull, that it yeelds you lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to these happy thoughts, which shall more fully acquaint you with him that is at once the God of Hosts, &amp; the Prince of Peace: To the furtherance whereof these my poore labours shall doe no thankelesse offices. In lieu of your noble fauours to me both at home, and where you haue merited command, nothing can bee returned but humble acknowledgements, and hearty prayers for the increase of your Honor, and all happinesse to your selfe, and your thrice-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vertuous Lady, by him that is deepely obliged, and truely deuoted to you both,</p>
