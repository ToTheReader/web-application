   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">Q</seg>Vintus Curtius,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writer of the great battels that king <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of Macedonie, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the most noble and rich king of the Medes and Persians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Darius</hi> (right worshipful sir) declareth (that when one <hi>Philip</hi> the Phisition vnto the said king <hi>Alexander,</hi> and his most tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie subiect,) by sodain chaunce the king fell sore sicke, to the great heauines of all his royall armie, at which time with all speede this phisition did prepare a medicine, most excellent for his souereigne Lord, whom he so dearely loued, to this end, that the great vertue thereof might preuent his present sicknesse, and immenent danger: but malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spite that wretched enemie, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sleepeth but watcheth euer, to bring


<pb facs="3"/>
vertue and good fame to destruction: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before this gentle <hi>Philip</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe vnto the king with his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Letters were sent to king <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> containing, that the said <hi>Philip</hi> was corrupted so with money from king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> that he had put most deadly poison and vncurable venom into <hi>Alexanders</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. The king perusing the letters, kept them secret vntill he had drunke his medicin, and immediatly hee tooke his phisition by the hand, and deliuered him the letters that he might reade them, hauing in him so great confidence, that he did in no maner of case mistrust him. The cause why I haue alledged this most worthy prince king <hi>Alexander,</hi> and his excellent phisition <hi>Philip,</hi> is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the great trust in the one, and the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the other, not forgetting the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse conditions of the flattering Parasites, which euer walke with two faces in one hood, bearing fire in the one hand, and water in the other: sowers of discord, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mischiefe: which be alwayes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto the disciples of <hi>Philip,</hi> whose venemous stings can not hurt them, which euer haue in store the precious, Iewell of pacience, and arme themselues to doe good


<pb facs="3"/>
to euerie good man, for the preseruation of their liues, by the true rules of the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of health, which here I am so bold to present vnto your worship. For whereas there lacketh gouernment in a common wealth, the people doe eftsoones fall into ruine. The ships that lacke good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, oftentimes be cast away vpon sands and rocks. And therefore there is nothing vnder heauen that hath life, but if it lacke good gouernment, it will quickly fall into vtter decay. For like as the Creator of all things hath formed the bodies of all men, into the goodliest shapes of euery liuing thing that euer was, or euer shall be: euen so hee hath ordained for man, hearbes, fruits, rootes, seeds, plants, gums, oyles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, beasts, foules fishes, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of health, to be moderately vsed with discretion, which peserueth the bodie in good estate, without whose vertues the bodies cannot liue, for they bee the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers of life. But misusing or abusing them, bringeth to the bodie many diseases, as rheumes, cathers, dropsies, impostumes, gowts, flixes, opilations, vertigoes, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ruptures▪ fransies, with many mo noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some diseases, which come thorowe the


<pb facs="4"/>
corruption of meats and ill aire. For what auaileth riches, honours, costly buildings, faire apparell, with all the pompe of this worlde, and to bee honoured of the people, and in the meane time to bee eaten with wormes in the breast, or in the bellie, consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Agues, tormented with gowtes, sorenesse, bone-ach, &amp;c. Well, I thinke an whole <hi>Codrus</hi> is better than a sicke <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Codrus, Mydas.</hi>
      </note>
And seeing that to possesse health, is better than to gouerne golde, insomuch that health maketh men more happie, stronger and quieter than all maner of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, lacking health: as example. Great princes, noble men, men of great substance, when they be wrapped and enclosed with many and sundry sicknesses, and in dayly daungers of death, in their extreme paines and passions, they do more greatly couet one drop of health, than a whole tunne of gold, crying out for the helpe and counsell of the Phisition.

      </note> and whom the almightie God did create and ordaine for the infirmitie of mankinde, and also medicine for his helpe, and that no wise man should despise them. Therefore yet againe (right worshipfull
