For whan I consydred what y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> matters were / and how many greate thingys had bene treated bytwene the messenger and me / and in what maner fashyone / albe it I mystrustyd not his good wyll / and very well trustede hys wyt / his lernyng / well seruyng hym to the perseuyng and reportyng of our cōmunycacyon / yet fyndyng oure tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atye so dyuerse and so long / and sume<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme such wyse intrycate that my self could not wythout labour call it order<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to mind / me thought I had not well done wythout wrytynge to trust hys onely memory / namely sith sum part{is} of the mater be such of theym selfe as rather nede to be attentely redde &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysed / thā houerly hard and passyd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

For thys cause me thought that for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more suertye my parte were to sende our cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munycacyon to my sayd frende in wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge. wherby yf yt had happed y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hys messenger had for eny synyster fauou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

so put in prent my booke framed after theyre fantesye. whych whan I wolde afterward reproue &amp; shew y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> differēce / I myght peraduenture seme for the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loure of my cause to haue amendede myne own vppon the syght of theyrs. For eschewyng whereof I ānow dre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen as I say to thys thyrde busynes of publyshyng and puttynge my boke in prynt my self. whereby theyr ētrepryse yf they shuld eny such intend / shall I trust be preuented and frustrate. And thys haue I done not all of myne own hed / but after the coūsayle of other mo thā one. whose aduyce and counsayle for theyr wysdome &amp; lernyng I asked in that byhalf / and whych haue at my requeste vouchesaufed to rede ouer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> boke ere I dyd put yt forth. For albeit that I dare be sūwhat bold to cōmen in famylyer maner w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> such as for theyr fantesye lyke to aske me of such maters eny questyon accordyng to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> counceyle of saynt Poule / byddynge vs be redy to gyue a rekenyng and to shew a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable cause to euery man of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faythe and hope that we haue / yet to make &amp; put forth eny boke wherin were tretyd eny such thyngys as to wch our fayth / wolde I not presume but yf better ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned than my selfe shulde thynke yt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profytable or at the lestwyse harm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lese.

In whych albe yt I saw none harme / yet sumwhat dowted I lest they shuld vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to sadd men seme ouer lyght &amp; wāton for the wayght and grauyte of such an erenest matter. wherfore in these two poyntys though I hade all redy seene some ēsāples of ryght holy mē / whych in theyre bokys answeryng to thobiec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cions of heretiques in theyr tyme haue nott letted to reherse the very formall wordys of theym whose wrytīgis they made answere to / beyng sometyme of such maner &amp; sorte as a good mā wold not well bere / and haue not also letted to wryte a mery word in a ryght ernest worke / of whych two thyngs I could owte of godly mennys bokis and holy sayntys workys gether a good sorte / yet in mine owne work I determyned that I wold nothyng allow nor defend that the iudgement of other vertuouse and cunnynge men wolde in eny wyse mysse lyke. And therefore after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> such had red hyt and seuerally sayde theyre aduyce / I found as hyt often happith / that sum thynge whyche one wyse and well lernyd manne wolde haue owte / twayne of lyke wysdome and lernyng specyally wolde haue in / neyther syde lackyng good and probable reasōe for theyre parte. wherfore syth hyt bycame not me to be iudge ouer the iudgment of theym whome I toke and chose for my iudges / beyng such of them self as hard were yt for eny man to say which of theym byfore the other he coulde in erudyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And thus mych haue I thought necessary for my declaracyon and excuse to aduertyse you all that shall happen to rede thys rude symple work / prayeng you of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyence and pardon / whom god of hys especyall grace graunte as mych pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> redyng / as my pore hart hath mente you and ētendede in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> making.</p>
