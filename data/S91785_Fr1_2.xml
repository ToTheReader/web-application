      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>VCH as of late yeares haue rent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from the holie seruice of God, vsed in the publique congregations and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of England, being destitute of any sound warrant from the worde of God, haue sought from time to time so much the more earnestly (as the manner of such is) to shroude themselues vnder the shadowe of humane authoritie. Hence it came to passe that master <hi>Francis Iunius,</hi> a man of great learning and godlinesse, was solicited by some of them (as may appeare by these letters ensuing) in the yeare <hi>99.</hi> to be a fauourer of their erronious opinions and of their vnchristian disordered and vndutifull proceedings: whose answere, being deliuered by himselfe to a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and worshipfull knight, and so comming to my handes, I haue presumed to communicate with thee, by the motion of some godly and well disposed, hoping that through the blessing of God, and thy prayers it may prooue a good meanes to stay such as are wauering, to confirme such as doe stand, and to recouer such as are fallen. For although he doe not enter into an exact dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing

of the question with arguments, obiections, and answeres: yet he vseth a very graue and godly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which is oftentimes of greater fruite, then a long and learned disputation. And whosoeuer doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently studie the booke of God, shal finde, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets &amp; Apostles do in manie places insist vpon a plaine &amp; simple asseueration of the truth rather the vpō multitude of proofs &amp; argumēts. Besides, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the story of the holy Martyrs of our own Church &amp; others, we may perceiue that by the soūd profession of their faith, and suffering for the same, they haue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God and aduanced the kingdome of Iesus Christ aswell as others haue done by arguments and reasons. And yet notwithstanding if thou do well obserue these letters of master <hi>Iunius,</hi> thou shalt finde in them not vaine and emptie wordes: but waightie and sounde reasons grounded vpon the holie Scriptures of god. Thus praying thee to take these first fruites of my poore laboures in this kinde in good part, and besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching god to giue a blessing hereunto; I bid thee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily farewell in the Lord.</p>
