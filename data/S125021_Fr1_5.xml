      </hi> the Conference betwéen <hi>Sim Certain</hi> and <hi>Pierce Plowman</hi> two great Clarkes as thou maist vnderstand by their Discourse, which I haue gathered and reported as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and as truely as my simple memory could retaine the same, and that with some trauaile which I occounted my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. First vnto them and others by them héerin mentioned.</p>
   <p>And secondly vnto all and euery good man and woman whose mindes and harts God may sturre vp vnto Godlynes and Vertue by their good ensample. Namely all such as are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Maisters of housholdes, but chéefly and principally of common Innes and Tauerns whose good or euill example spreadeth far and wide and I feare in these our daies rather in corruption of life and maners: then in edifiyng or increase of Vertue and Godlynes according to the saying of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Sirach</hi> that it is as hard for a Merchant to be no lyar and for a Tauerner or Inholder to be no drunkerd which thing although hée hath said to be very hard: yet (for the Inholder) that his rule admitteth exception, thou maist héer finde with out traueling to <hi>Rippon</hi> in Yorkshire to learne and so for a grote or sixpence thou maist know y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which cost mée aboue fiue markes to learne besides my trauail and time spent, which yet if it please thée to accept: I shal account right wel bestowed, which God graunt, and that in all thy Iourneis thy head ake not before thou alight in such an Hostry.
