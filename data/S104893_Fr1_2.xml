      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great desire and godlie delight, which J knowe to be in you both, to heare, reade and meditate in the Law of GOD, with that blessed man, whom Dauid describeth: the bringing vp of your children with Abraham in the way of the Lord, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of your family in godlines, with your worthie examples vnto others, and vertues thereunto correspondent (besides your manifolde friendshippes towards me, your poore neighbour):
<pb facs="3"/> haue often times moued me to praise GOD for you, and to commend your happie lot: And at this time to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold some parte of my gratefull good will, by sending vnto you this little token (the complaint of Tyme). I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to accept it gladly at my handes, in regarde of my good will, chiefly in respect of the thing itselfe, which (though as briefe a Jonas Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Niniue) expresseth greate matter for instruction, admonition, exhortation, commination, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in all pietie. The Lord make vs thankefull for his gratious benefites, and so to vse the happie Time of our peace, that our great prosperitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other Nations, may rather fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vs, than hinder vs in that good
<pb facs="3"/> course of godlines which we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne, to the attaining of eternall life in Christ Iesu. And that howsoeuer all the world be affected, we may fully resolue to serue the Lorde as Josua did, with our families: and not forget to pray vnto GOD with Hester and her Maidens. Then shall wee enioy the benefite of our blessed time with Hezekias, and obtaine that safete ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our enemies, which other godlie haue obtayned by the mercie and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnes of our good GOD. To whose blessed protection I commend you and yours. London, this last of June, 1582.</p>
