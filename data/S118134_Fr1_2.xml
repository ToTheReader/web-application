   <head>TO THE NO lesse worthy then learned Gentleman, the Lord <hi>Giouan Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tista Licino.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Yr, I perceiue you are an earnest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessour &amp; suter, that I would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Declamation I made some fewe yeares ago against Women, to come abroade in Print: and to perswade me vnto the same, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge two reasons. The one is, because it being (as you say) a most rare and curious peece of worke, it is sought for and desired


<pb facs="3"/>
of many. The other, for that you doubt lest the world seeing the Answere of my deare Cosin <hi>Signior Torquato Tasso,</hi> vnto the same, falsly presupposing that I blame Marriage, it might one day (as you doubt) hauing no witnesse to cōtrary it, bring some blemish or staine vnto the clearnesse and purenesse of my pietie and religion: And therefore I, who for your first reason wold haue most plainly &amp; absolutely haue denied your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, knowing verie well the lightnesse and the vnperfectnesse of this Discourse, In consideratiō of your second, cannot chuse but yeeld vnto your friendly desire: so as I, resigning all the interest and right I haue of the same vnto you, do giue you full power &amp; authoritie to do with this toy what you please: for, for mine owne part, I assure you I knew not vpon whom to bestow it, for the vnworthinesse thereof. Only this I will intreate you, that when you shall send it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to be common, you will vouch safe me so much fauor, as to satisfie the curious Reader, that it was done vpon no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, then of a certaine youthfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichious


<pb facs="3"/>
Humour, protesting vnto you, that I my selfe longere this, had contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same, had not my foresaid famous kinsman preuented me in mine own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whose conclusion and censure, as I ratifie and confirme for most infallible and true: so, who shall reade mine owne, shall easely perceiue that it doth not much disagree from his opinions, if hee well marke and haue but an eye vnto the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ende of the matter from whence the maner of Writers is to drawe and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their purpose &amp; inuentions. And thus crauing euerie Noble and generous minde, to make the best construction of the same, <hi>Vibascio le Mani,</hi> and bid you farewell. From my House in <hi>Bergamo,</hi> this first of May, 1598.</p>
