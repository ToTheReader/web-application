   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader whosoever, hold me excused, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so excellent a Subject, I have wrought
so inartificially, and like that Brick-layer
of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> because he could set stones in
Mortar, undertooke to set Diamonds in
Gold. True it is, there are some persons
of that transcendent worth and desert, that all indifferent
praise falleth short of them, as there have beene some men
beyond imitation for their excellencie in their severall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
and though this regard onely might have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
mee <hi>Silence,</hi> beside the disesteeme of Poetrie in this
latter age of the world, (wherein, to scorne learning, and
to know nothing, are accounted Gentlemanlike quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
yet seeing living Examples of Vertue are so few and
rare (appearing but here and there one, in a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
like starres in a mistie or dark night) and that I
knew not how to require the many favors I formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from her Honour, beside the friendly respect I have
found from the most and neerest allied in bloud unto Her,
I have adventured once againe with ORPHEUS to raise up
EURIDICE, my dead and forgotten Muse, to review the
light, it being now eleven yeares since I published any
thing in this Elegiack kinde; which then was an <hi>April</hi>
SHOWER, upon the death of that truly Noble, and verie
learned Lord, <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Dorset:</hi> and soone after, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the too untimely decease of the most vertuous and
hopefull young Lady FRANCES, daughter to Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM
WRAY Knight, (and sometime wife unto that
worthy and generous Knight Sir ANTHONIE IRBIE of
<hi>Boston</hi>) who lyeth buried at ASHBIE, where the Lady
WRAY her Mother (a religious, charitable, and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lady) at this time liveth.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
And whereas in this Elegie of mine, by a <hi>Parergicall</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
I make mention for the Honour of the Shire, of
many brave and excellent spirits it hath bred, I have not
done it without example of the best approved Poets: And
as <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> saith of <hi>Germanie,</hi> so I may say of this Shire, that
it is Hominum <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> a shop of men, where they may bee
found serviceable, either for affaires of Peace or Warre:
besides a Discour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e which I had with a verie Honourable
and a learned Personage, at his table, concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
gave some occasion thereof.</p>
   <p>For this Noble Lady deceased, if I have falne short of
the just report of her worth, and have not shewed her
with that lustre and life I ought, and is she deserved, I crave
pardon of those who know her best, and from whom I
should have received information (for doubtlesse her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
deeds were great and many) but those who were
neerest about her, after her death being disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>sed, and far
off; I have in a manner altogether out of my knowledge,
collected the substance of what I have written; imitating
those Painters, who when they cannot get the life, are
faine, for the grosser lights and shadowes, to be beholding
to their memories. Farewell.</p>
