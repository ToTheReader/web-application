      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a custome (right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my most singular good Lord) both amongst the aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romans,</hi> and also amongst the wise <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery idle person should giue an account of the expence of his howers: Now I that am most idle, and least imployed in your Familie, present here vnto your Lordships hands an account of the expence of my idle time, which how well, or ill, it is, your Noble wisedome must both iudge and correct; onely this I am acertain'd, that for the generall rules and Maximes of the whole worke, they are most infallibly true, and perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with our English climate. Now if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall doubt of the true tast of the liquor because it proceedeth from such a vessell as my selfe, whom you may imagine vtterly vnseasoned vvith any of these knowledges, beleeue it (my most best Lord) that for diuers yeeres, wherein I liued most happily, I liued

a Husbandman, amongst Husbandmen of most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge; during all which time I let no obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ouer-slip me: for I haue euer from my Cradle beene naturally giuen to obserue, and albe I haue not that oylie tongue of ostentation which loueth euer to be babling all, and somewhat more then it knoweth, drawing from ignorance admiration, and from wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome laughter, filling meale-times with much vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable noyse; yet I thanke my maker I haue a breast which containeth contentment inough for my selfe, and I hope much benefit for the whole Kingdome; how euer or whatsoeuer it is, it is all your Lordships, vnder the couert of whose fauourable protection if it may finde grace it is the vttermost aime whereunto my wishes aspire, nor shall I feare the malignitie of the curious, for it is not to them but the honest plaine English Husbandman, I intend my labours, vvhose defender you haue euer beene, and for whose Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prosperitie both they and I will continually pray.</p>
