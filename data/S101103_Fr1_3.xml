      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His olde prouerbe (as cōmonly all other) hath his groūd vpon knowē experience, <hi>Malus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, malamens,</hi> an euill affection maketh an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill construction. Men wrest or driue the interpretaciō of doings to the frame of their owne coceits, which they deriue from the fauour or disfauour that they haue settled in their owne perswasions. It is not vnknowen what extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discourses, &amp; what priuate fansies in common meetīgs, are daily made of the case of our neighbours in the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Such maner of debatinge where cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opiniōs haue distracted you seeme to be the cause of your question, wherof you desire to be resolued in your letters.
<pb facs="4"/>You coulde not haue written to a man more indifferent than I am: who am as farre from parcialitie, as he that loueth, (that is to say preferreth) neither party before other, but our country before thē both. I do therefore (as I wish you to doe) set the pin of the beame eauen, and examine the weight of either skale. Let vs then cōpare the sides, and begin with the sharper, that we maye haue the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ending.</p>
   <p>First I will call to minde, what thone of those sides obiecteth:</p>
   <p>Secondly what thother aunswereth: And thirdly what to drawe to concerne our selues.</p>
   <p>In the matter of obiection, let vs see what strength it hath in iustice:</p>
   <p>In the matter of defence, let vs see what weight it hath in equitie:</p>
   <p>And for the matter of Our selues, let vs see what necessity, what commodity, what right, and what facilitie it is said to beare, to draw vs to any side.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>It is sayd by some, which are loth that Spaine should be weaker or Englande stronger, that the Prince of Orendge &amp; his adherēts are rebels in Armes agaīst their natural Prince, and maintayners of a most daungerous president against all Princes.</p>
   <p>To this is aunswered on thother part (as in this booke you shal see discoursed) that there is difference of the bande &amp; maner of their subiection from other. None of them holdeth that a king maye be shaken of by his subiects: but they all saye, that Lords electible vpon pacts &amp; conditions are also reiectible accordīge to the same pacts &amp; cōditions, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Dominions subiecte to the ciuill lawes, which are not the Lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The order of eche state is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: not all States haue kings. Some haue other formes of gouernment. Not all kingdoms haue like maner of admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or receyuings of kings. Som follow natural succession of bloud: some Choise:
<pb facs="5"/>some Lot or chaunce. Some kings or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers haue simple &amp; absolute power: some limitted &amp; circumscribed. Therles of Holland and Zealand (as is well knowē &amp; many examples haue proued, at their <hi>Ioyous entree</hi> that is to saye, at ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuinge to inauguration or seisen of their Estate) be bound by oth to prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed pacts &amp; orders: whereby not onelye their forme of rule is bounded, but also vpon diuers points the subiects homage &amp; allegiance expresly discharged. And that discharg in fact hath bin executed, &amp; by such fact, (say they,) the auncesters of the Prince himself that now chargeth them, haue bin receyued. The Prince and states of that Country alledge the othe of their Earle, the precise forme of assoylmēt vpon his breach of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges: they produce one chiefe point, that they ought not to be pestered with gouernaunce or garrison of straungers: they recken vp thintollerable, outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; manifest oppressions done vpon
<pb facs="5"/>them, and the euident practise to bring that free Nation to most vnsufferable seruitude: they shield themselues vnder the liberty &amp; right of Nature, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of agreements, the othes of their Princes, their power of refusall vppon their Princes periurie, wyth many like matters, whereof they make the worlde Iudges by their many Protestacions, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies, Iustifications, &amp; Supplicatiōs to the states of thempyre, &amp; other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: alwayes seuering their case from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subiectes of Naturall and absolute Kinges.</p>
   <p>FOR (say they) in their case of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge the Kinge, these things are to be considered: the nature of the Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and subiection, &amp; the cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and thirdly the maner of the resistance. The nature of the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; the subiection stādeth in these two considerations. VVhether it hee <hi>Merum Imperium,</hi> that all thinges may be done <hi>Pro voluntate Regnanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>:</hi> or it be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratum,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>which is <hi>Temperatū Legibus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ruler hath his rule prescribed him which way to rule, &amp; the Subiect a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne described him which way to obey. If the Gouernment be <hi>Merum &amp; absolutū,</hi> then is the Person inferiour, a slaue and no subiecte. For in all due subiection there is <hi>Taxis,</hi> which is neuer in <hi>Voluntate.</hi> If the Gouernmente be <hi>Temperatum,</hi> then is thinferiour a subiect and no slaue.</p>
   <p>IN all subiection there is an honest liberty giuen by Law it self, whereby all Actions and Pleas in Lawe are as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the subiect as to the ruler, for the maintenaunce of truth and equitie. In slauerie there is none such: because he is not to be measured but by the will of the Ruler, which howsoeuer it turneth, is his right: &amp; he hath no actiō of Appeal or Plea to the contrary.</p>
   <p>Then it followeth that the Law is the rightest Auctoritie, and the same is to be maintayned by all the iust and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full executers of it: for if the Lawe
<pb facs="6"/>be not maynteined, the life of the whole common wealth is lost.</p>
   <p>This mayntenaunce of the Lawe no man doubteth vvhether it ought to bee or no: for it is thende vvhy Counsellers &amp; vnder magistrats are appoīted: yea it is the cause of placing the highest Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate hymselfe. So that to maintayne the Lavv, is iudged meete by all men: if the Lavv be iust.</p>
   <p>But whether the Law may be mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned agaynst the Highest Magistrate or no, that is the doubt. For here upō this maintenance of Law is called resistāce, and is called Rebellion?</p>
   <p>This question doth imply a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for it importeth that thone is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst thother, &amp; no man can serue two Maisters: &amp; so stādeth the vvhole case in the righteousnes of the Lavv, which for the present purpose is presumed to be most iust &amp; most holy. VVhy then? The Person that is agaynst this Lavv, goeth aboute to disanull that that is
<pb facs="7"/>most iust and most holy, &amp; laboureth to bring in that, that is most vniust, most vnholy. For touchinge his owne person the question and debate standeth not, but for thinforcing of the subiects to the same.</p>
   <p>VVHY then, there is no doubt but as it is confessed of all mē, both that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew God, and of them that do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse God, that iustice is to be maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against iniustice, Godlines against vngodlines, &amp; God against the deuill: els were the law no law, neither the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect a subiect: being (as I sayd before) a person licenced to liue in liberty of law.</p>
   <p>Thus by the nature of Gouernment &amp; the subiection, it is euidente that the rightest Magistrate may be resisted, &amp; this resistance is truly a maintenaunce of Law &amp; equitie and so to be termed, and vntruly and vniustly called Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. For these words of rebellion and suche like cannot iustlye bee vsed, but where the wyll of the Ruler and the law
<pb facs="7"/>are concurrent and agree in one.</p>
   <p>By this that hath bin saide of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment it selfe, ensueth a right aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the cause of resistāce. Nothing may cause resistance to the Magistrate but the maintenaunce of righte and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: for there is no equitie in this, that the will of the subiect should stand for a lawe to the Prince, where the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect thinketh it vnmeete that the wil of his Prince should stande for a law of his subiection. This is against Iustice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributiue, which the Heathen teach in their common wealth, &amp; flatly against the rule of GOD: <hi>Thou shalte not do to thy Neighbour y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thou vvilt not haue don to thy selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>SO then he that hath law &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the law, is resisted on which part soeuer he be: &amp; he that resisteth the law is a rebell and traitour whosoeuer he be: for the law is <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> life of the cōmon weale. And the consideration of resistance stā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the person, vnlesse hee haue the law with him: if he be not <hi>Lex loquēs,</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>he is not resisted, but resisteth.</p>
   <p>But euery man may not resist. They onely that are made keepers of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, to thē it belōgeth: otherwyse there would be a confusiō, and euery man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croche vpon an others office. The shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloude is murther in euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man: but if a Magistrate do it, he doth it lawfully, and is excused before man, and doth his dutie to God: For hee beareth not the sword in vaine.</p>
   <p>IN sum, where the kind of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is tempered by Law, &amp; the Prince hath aswell to liue by law as the subiect: if the Prince wil breake this Law which is iust, &amp; enforce an obedience to a law vniust against the will of the Subiects: the law may be maintayned agaīst him, by such as are appointed from God &amp; the law, to be Gardians &amp; kepers of the law. But the case of the Prince of Orenge &amp; his associats stādeth in <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> same termes. The king with whom he hath to deale had auctoritie <hi>Temperatam Laegibus:</hi> hee
<pb facs="8"/>was sworne aswel to the keeping of those lawes and bringing in of no new, as the subiects vvere, &amp; if hee brake his othe, they vvere quit of all obedience. This appeareth in <hi>Forma iuramenti,</hi> vvhich hee toke at his Ioyous entraunce.</p>
   <p>This othe &amp; Lavv vvas broken by brīging in a nevv lavv of Inquisition, vvhich tended to the vtter supplāting of the Prince and states of the country, vvhich notvvythstanding they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a season, vsing al dutiful meanes by complaints made from the counsell &amp; states at diuers &amp; sōdry times, as are to be seene, but coulde haue no redresse in deede, though oftentimes they had faire promises. VVhen iustice could not be had by vvay of iust complaint from the Coūsell &amp; States: the Prince &amp; States toke the maintenaūce of the lavv into their ovvne hands, and so retaine it by Iustice, reseruing the auncient liberties &amp; lavves to the benefite of all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> none cōplayneth of wrōg done
<pb facs="9"/>vnto him, but the will of that Prince who woulde his will shoulde preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaīst Law to the subuersion of the whole state, as appeareth in their Records.</p>
   <p>Therfore this maintenaunce of law by the Prince of Orenge, is right, against the breaker of Lawe and bringer in of Tyrannie, the Spanish kinge. They say, brīger in of Tirāny &amp; breaker of Law, for that contrary to his oth, wherby both he &amp; all the Erles of Holland &amp; Zelād haue bin receiued into <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> gouernmēt, &amp; no otherwyse but vpon those condicions limitted to them by their said oth, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the whole state of gouernmente, leaueth no law but his own wil, &amp; so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself, as though he had neuer bin sworne, nor taken the countries vvith condicion, but had entred as an absolute conquerour: Farre inferiour therin to Heathē &amp; barbarous Prīces. VVe read of Cyrus the greate Monarche of the Easte, that aboue all his singuler ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which purchased him so greate a
<pb facs="9"/>Fame as euer any Prince had, hee had this in him, that he suffered all Natiōs vnder his Monarchie to enioye their owne Lawes, customes, liberties &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and made no alteration against their wills. The like we finde recorded of Alexander the Greate, who vsed himselfe after the same sort in all his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, contenting him onely with the Soueraignties ouer <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> Natiōs which he subdued, without any alteratiō of their Estate. And did not the auncient Romaynes walke after the same sorte, whē they subdued any Nation to their obediēce? Did they euer alter the state, of any coūtry which they conquered, &amp; enforce their people to receiue their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and Religion? VVhat course vsed <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in his Conquests of Fraūce▪ Did he chaūg any one iote of the state of those Citties which he conquered?</p>
   <p>Thus was the behauiour of those barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes, euen in their Conquests. such moderation and equitie vsed they
<pb facs="10"/>euē in the middes of their fire &amp; sword.</p>
   <p>The kinge of Spaine came not in by force, he was receyued by curtesie, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as a Patrone and Protectour of their liberties, and vpon this condition onely, had the Seigniories giuen him, as to his predecessours before him, that hee should keepe those Lawes and liberties safe &amp; sound, by vertue of which, &amp; for preseruation wherof they cast vpon him the Erledom, as they had don in former times vpon his auncesters. Vppon this condition he toke it, &amp; to this conditi he swore, as all his aūcesters did, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; yelding himselfe to the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour that other had incurred before him, &amp; by whose fall his auncesters came into that preferment, if he committed the like trespasse against the states. To this, (I say) he was boūd by oth, let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be demaunded, if he cā denie it, they are cōtent to stand to the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the world, as falsaccusers of so mighty a Prince, in charging him wyth
<pb facs="10"/>periurie, a most horrible crime both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God &amp; man. But hee wil not, hee doth not denie it, it is confessed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and published by Print in his owne books, vnder his owne Priuiledge. How thē stādeth his case &amp; theirs? was he not boūd by oth to obserue their lawes? And in case he or any of his officers &amp; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters did not obserue but breake theim, did he not expresly charge &amp; enioyne al his subiects by the same oth to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance against him &amp; them, and in no wyse to yeld him any obedience, vntil he stoode and yelded to the fulfilling of his othe? The matter, as I sayde, is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, books imprīted vnder his owne Priuiledge vouch it to all the vvorlde. And shall they that stand for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a law so iustly, being further charged thereto by the kings owne oth, be notvvithstandinge deemed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels? Surely if there be no more than so, wee haue no reasō so to esteme or iudge
<pb facs="11"/>of thē. Mē might do no more, if either the kings auctority ouer thē vvere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, or they had contrary to all right of obediēce, made resistāce there, where they ought to haue shewed all obediēce. But as the vvorld is not able to charge them vvith the one, so the king I suppose will not chaleng vnto himself the other. VVe finde recorded by all that are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as vvell heathen as Christians, as vvell in lavves of the Gētiles as in the lavves of God: that it is one thing to be <hi>Princeps supremus,</hi> a Superiour &amp; highest gouernour: &amp; an other thing to be <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or absolutus,</hi> an absolute lord. The one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a soueraintie &amp; chieftie of all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are within one list of lavv, as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est minister of the lavv, but yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vvithin the compasse of the same lavv: the other noteth a person vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compasse of al iurisdiction, a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller of all men, &amp; to be controlled of none. VVhoso vvould chaleng this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter point to be the right of the kings ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
<pb facs="11"/>in those coūtryes, (I meane, that he would make him an absolute Lord &amp; not a Supreme and highest Gouernoure,) hee should greatly discredite his honour in taking his othe. For force any personne what soeuer he bee, to take an othe and not to mynde to keepe it, is in that degree of dishonoure, as carryeth wyth it an impietie against GOD himselfe, and ingendreth a iuste suspicion in all men that shall haue to deale with him: for who would contract with that mā in any sorte, that can &amp; will make so small accompte of that, which hee hath called God himselfe to witnes of, &amp; vowed to his Maiestie to keepe, in the presence of the Angels. I can not thinck so euill of the honour of a Prince, as that he would enter into so greate impietie: I iudge honourably of the Kinge of Spaine, and therefore I may not deeme, that he was of the Nature of that wicked Heathen, that sayd for excuse of himselfe, in a case of like quality. <hi>Lingua iuraui, mentem iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuratam
<pb facs="12"/>gero:</hi> I svvore wyth my tongue, so that my tongue standeth bounde by othe, but I cary a minde and hart about me that hath not sworne, ne standeth so tyed. Be it farre from any Christian, to haue so euill an opinion of any Christiā, wee haue not so to thincke of any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, vnlesse we heare him speake and protest so, as that wretched caitife did. VVe see euidently by his ovvne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp; testimonie of all the world, that such an oth he toke, and the honourable opinion that we oughte to conceyue of the Maiestie of a Kinge muste needes persvvade vs, that hee meant them as he swore. As he swore (I say) when hee in the same article exempted them from all obedience, and armed them that should attempte ought to the contrary: If hee svvore this, and mente this, then are they no rebelles, in fulfillinge that, vvhich hee charged them vppon theyr othes.</p>
   <p>But vvhat saye they, that vvil (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstandinge)
<pb facs="12"/>iustifie the Kings do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges and blame the subiectes with so greeuous a crime. For no one iote of that that is aforesayd can be denyed. They saye that the Pope, who hath from GOD <hi>Plenitudinē potestatis,</hi> Fulnes of povver, did dispense vvith him from this othe. Firste if that bee so, that the Pope hath freed him from his othe, then hath hee by the same facte freed them from their obedience: for they vvere in no wyse, nor by vertue of any title sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to him, but by vertue and title of his othe. Take the grounde of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection avvay, and they are not subiect but free.</p>
   <p>But vvhether it he so or no, that the Pope hath throughe his absolute power, (which he calleth <hi>Plenitudinē,</hi> fulnes of povver) freed him from that othe, I knovv not: onely this I know, that the Bishop of <hi>Arras,</hi> aftervvard Cardinal of <hi>Granuile</hi> gaue him suche Counsell, &amp; sayd the Pope should do so. And if it
<pb facs="13"/>followed so in effect, as it may be wel cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured by the sequel, (for no doubte a king would not stād so stoutly to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence &amp; maintenaunce of such impietie against God &amp; man, as periurie is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he had some better ground &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante) this wilbe a Caueat, and a lesson for all Princes &amp; States to teach them to bevvare howe they deale anye more with the kinge of Spaine, or any other that giueth such credite to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pope. For what assurance cā they haue of all their Contracts and Leagues that passe and are made betwene them, if the othes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, may be dispensed withall at the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes pleasure? That were nothing els in deede and effecte, but to bring all true Christian Kinges and Princes, vvhich make conscience and put a Religion in the bretch of their othes, into bondage &amp; slauery: to make them serue the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profite of the other Romishe kinge: vvho mindeth no further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his, then shall stande vvith his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite,
<pb facs="13"/>or pleasure of that higher power of Rome. If the case stand so, what faults soeuer Princes haue committed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time in this behalf, I doubt not but they wilbe wyser and more circumspect hereafter. I meane they will make no leagues nor take anye othes of the Pope ☜ or any Princes and States of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, seing they haue so plaine a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dēt in this case, that their othes may &amp; shalbe dispensed wythall, when and how ofte soeuer they liste. I suppose there vvas such a clause in the Contract that vvas made vvith the kinge of Spayne for the mariage of Queene Mary, that he should not alter or chaunge any one iote of the Lawes and Customes aswel publike as priuate of the Realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, if he had broken this braunch, &amp; vouched the equity of his dealing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vppon a licence &amp; dispensation from the Pope, I doubt sore whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and States of England would haue taken that for good payment: I doubte
<pb facs="14"/>I say, vvhether the Nobility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Englande, would haue suffered him vnder that cloake, to haue bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed all the Lavves of Englande and brought in the gouernmēt of <hi>Millan</hi> or <hi>Naples?</hi> I doubt, vvhether the Nobles and people of England would haue bin accōpted rebels for vvithstanding such breatch of Contract. I doubt, vvhether they vvould haue suffred him so quietly to haue caryed awaye the Crowne from the Queenes Maiestie to haue set it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Spaniards heads? And yet hee might as iustly haue done that, as this, if this rule be good. VVe may thanck God we are deliuered from him, wee cannot tell what he woulde haue done, thoughe wee may surmise by this president, what he might haue pretended. I tell you, this excuse of periurie may seeme reasonable to them that are of his Court, for such a God they haue: but it is a perillous presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for vs, vnlesse wee bevvare of it. If it seeme a good plea for king Philip to
<pb facs="14"/>say, he hath not broken his othe herein, because the Pope dispēsed with him, what maye all Princes that haue made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with him loke for, but iuste quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againste themselues to be reuenged both with fire and svvord, when soeuer the Pope shall list to dispense? And I am afrayde the benefite of this dispensation wilbe vsed, if at any time they may haue oportunity (which God forbid) for <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> Q. Ma. &amp; the realm of Englād as they say, stand excōmunicat: if so thē all oth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spēsed withall, you know that very well. How be it if Christiā Prīces, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse God &amp; conscience, shall iudge this dealing to be good, &amp; if they can so eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade thēselues, that such maner of dalying with othes, is Christiā &amp; Prīce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, surely then wil I as they say &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> the K. of Spaine hath right, and the Prince of Orenge &amp; States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; Zelande haue wronge, that his bretch of oth, law &amp; custome, is lawful, &amp; they in withstāding it, are rebels &amp; traitours.</p>
   <pb facs="15"/>
   <p>But if they shall iudge with the truth, as truth is in deede, that no mortall man can dispense with an othe that bindeth the conscience of man, for it is a matter within the iurisdictiō of God alone, &amp; againe, if they shal cōsider this wyth thē selues, that all the righte and title that the King of Spaine hath to those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes is onely by vertue of this othe and no otherwyse, so that his superioritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them stādeth but by way of Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if hee performe those conditions, (for hee hath no better title then all his predecessours had) then will they easelie resolue, that there is great fault in that pretence, yea very preiudicious and an euill presidente to all Princes that haue to contract vvyth him: &amp; on the other side, that the Prince and the States do in iustice and equitie both before God and man what they do: and are not to be charged with these greeuous termes of Rebels and Traytours.</p>
   <p>NOVV for our owne case, (say they
<pb facs="15"/>that like of that parte) it is good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member for the necessitie, what neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours we haue &amp; what mīds our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours haue: vvhat affections haue bin vttered, in subscriptions to the Counsel or conspiracie of Trent, wherin the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all Protestant Princes (&amp; namely of <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

<pb facs="16"/>How in those dominions daily boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue bin published with open war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, priuiledge, and allowaunce most slaunderous to the Queene, and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against her state: How the traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Papists are there vpholden in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and dignitie, who doubte not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to affirme, that he cannot erre that hath pronounced our Queene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued: what deuises haue bin vsed by one Embassadour, a holy bishop, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Aquila, against her Maiestie and her Counsell: How by an other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour De Spese, lewde and vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly letters haue bin written vnder saucy signes of the names of <hi>Oriane Amadis,</hi> and such vnprincely toyes, audaciously to reatch at the honour of such a moste vertuous, high &amp; noble Queene: Howe the same rashe personage hath not bin misliked there for his so doing: How the <hi>Bull</hi> of her Maiesties depriuation, &amp; of the assoyling of her subiects frō their alle giaūce, hath bin printed, spred abroade,
<pb facs="16"/>set vpon posts, &amp; magnificētly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to knowledge in the low Countryes remayninge vnder that Princes rule: How in Spaine it self, her Ma subiects are daily takē &amp; imprisoned, manacled tormented &amp; exquisitely murdered in cōtēpte of her Maiesties honour, and <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> safe freedō of mutual trafique: How <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Inquisitiō is permitted dayly to rage against Englishmē, for praying to God euen on Seabord, accordīg to the lawes of the Church of England: Howe the Prince excuseth thē, by saying he cānot disobey the Church. And must he obey the Church, in following their sentence that the Queene of Englād is depriued of her Crowne? The euident apparence that he lacketh onely opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade England: a thing most apt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his conquest, and a thing most needefull for him, wherewith to reteyne the rest of his owne.</p>
   <p>One most vrgent neede, not to haue him to strong. One most important pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
<pb facs="17"/>to hold warre farther of, rather thā to draw it home. Infinite are both the reasons &amp; occasions that this cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth.</p>
   <p>For the cōmoditie, behold (say they) the fruitful land: the dominiō of Sea by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaciō: the neerenes of the Continēt to hold our warres, or do displeasures far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of from England: the rule of trade both of the riuer of Rhene, and land of Germany: the commodities passing that vvay both for Marchandise and Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: as Cables, Pitch, Tarre, Mastes &amp; other matter for Shippes, to be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to ourselues, &amp; scarce to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes at oure pleasures, the greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease &amp; safety of the trade of our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants euery where. But of these profits there is no end. And among other this is the greatest, that they vvill not (like Ireland) be chargeable, but a most Noble encrease of reuenevves to the Crovvne, able at their ovvne charge to defende themselues vnder her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisties
<pb facs="17"/>name &amp; protection, and to serue the Realme of Englād: a Nauie ioyned with her Maiesties Nauie, and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners able to hold and driue from Sea all Princes in Christēdom. Finally Safety, Riches, Strēgth, and honour.</p>
   <p>For right, their offers (say they) make it apparent both by discent in her Ma. (if the holder against his oth vvil stand vpon discent alone): electiō by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vpō breach of othes &amp; pacts: on tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte rightfull conquest vppon iust causes, for so manifest iniuries &amp; perils: a conquest I say, yet with a sweete and easye yoke to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people willing to receiue it. For facility, is to be marked (saye they) their owne offer, the readinesse of the people to embrace, their owne strēg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the to haue stand thus long alone, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting of the aduersary, &amp; all cōmodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunities, delyuered by God him self. And to all these good meanes, the moste glorious acte to releue the Church of God against Papists, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
<pb facs="18"/>and enemyes of publike naturall and Christen fayth, the great meane to appease the controuersies of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for Religion.</p>
   <p>Adde also the noble pollicy &amp; fitnes, to enter into vniuersal league of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians against the Pope &amp; Popish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies: the aide of so noble a Prince, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Prince of Orenge, so able, so worthy and so likely a man to serue Christendom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Empire of the Turcke, &amp; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Rome: the greedy ioye of her Maiesties people to follow her pleasure in pursuing of such a noble enterprise.</p>
   <p>Thus you see what I haue heard say on all sides: I leaue to you the iudgment of all these conceits: I leaue to Counsellers the gouerning of vs all by the best adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and directions: who (I doubt not in their wisedoms) do see the best: &amp; in this Parliamēt cā lack no help of consent &amp; sinewes, that this Realme cā giue. And I leaue to God the guidinge of harts &amp; successes.</p>
   <pb facs="18"/>
   <p>But beside all that I haue noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> opiniōs of other, this you shall take as mine owne full beleuing: that it is not in our will to haue peace by lettīg them alone, when the aduersary tarieth but to subdue them, that he may aduaūce himself agaīst vs. But to hold warre fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, both in place and time is novv offered to her Maiesties Election. Peace she cannot haue sure, by peace.</p>
   <p>And one notable matter I hear of: they be most desirous <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> England will receiue them: but rather then they will returne to their old thraldome, they will creepe vnder the yoke, euen of the Muscouite or Turke himselfe. Much rather will they yeld them to Fraunce, that hath now so many armies ready to take hold of thē, if Englād reiect thē. That consequence may proue ill for vs: And I do not take it certaine that Fraunce shall for euer haue ciuill warres. It maye be that God after the bloud of so many Martirs, wil giue peace to his Church in Fraūce. You
