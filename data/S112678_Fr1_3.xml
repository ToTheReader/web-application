                 <title>The dodechedron of fortune; or, The exercise of a quick wit : A booke so rarely and strangely composed, that it giueth (after a most admirable manner) a pleasant and ingenious answer to euery demaund; the like whereof hath not heretofore beene published in our English tongue. Being first composed in French by Iohn de Meum, one of the most worthie and famous poets of his time; and dedicated to the French King, Charles the fift, and by him, for the worth and raritie thereof, verie much countenanced, vsed, and priuiledged: and now, for the content of our countrey-men, Englished by Sr. W.B. Knight. The vse of the booke the preface annexed declareth</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is easie to imitate: So may the youngest Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of
good vtterance, deliuer the learnedst Oration, that euer was penned, by the
grauest and most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentest Orator. The painter also with small
skil may pomeis out his patterne, to make his picture like the principall. And
so may any imbossed forme be cast in a mould, to shape the same as
it was from the first hand in these slights. Some Commendations the doer
may deserue: Yet far from the merits of him, whose learned schoole was
first the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. But as <hi>Theseus</hi> hauing conquered the Minotaur,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inclosed in a laberinth, and thereby vnable to get out and
manifest his victorie to the world: So my selfe hauing subdued sloth,
by reading, thought my victorie to be but vaine, vnlesse I could come forth
to encourage others by my successe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Theseus,</hi> I
haue but wound vp <hi>Ariadnes</hi> clew or bottome, and so proceeded by the
threed, to translate so neere as I could this most pleasant and
ingenious worke, written first by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iohn de Meum</hi> a famous French
Poet, wishing it had rather bin by some other then by me perfected, whose
learned skill and scope of words, might haue adorned the same, for the more
pleasant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to the Reader. But because my intent was no farther
then for the pleasure of some my familiar friends, I only to giue them
content, haue with ordinary phrases performed the translation the best I
could, crauing therfore if it wander beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that then the
gentle Reader will excuse me, in my errors, and rather be silent, then
reprochfully reproue me, confessing my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as also my
profession of a Souldier to be most vnfit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same, as it
is worthie for the inuention. And thus, friend and vnacquainted whosoeuer,
hoping thou wilt fauour me to my good meaning, I leaue my labours, and the
sport to thy good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and rest,</p>
