   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F euer men needed too learne vvhat patience is: surely the state of this present time ought to leade yea and too dravve them to it. For if vvee looke vvell about vs, vvee shall finde that there hath not bin almost any Realme or countrie, vvherein God hath not vttered great scourges. If ye demaund the cause: it is euident, so as euen the blinde (as ye vvould say) may see it. Let the old men that are now aliue consider the vvicked things vvhich they haue seene committed commonly, since they vvere firste able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, vnto this day: and must they not needs say (as it vvas sayd of the tyme of the generall flud) that all flesh hath corrupted his vvayes vpon earth, that all is full of extorcion and outrage, and that such as beare the name of Christiās do (as sayth Sainct Peter) fulfill the vvaye of the heathen, by liuing in shamefulnesse, pride, lecherie, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, gluttonie, quaffing and abhominable idolatrie? But like as it is good to knovve the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the aduersities that happen, to the intent that men may the better bethink themselues, to amend as vvell publikely as priuately: so is it right necessarie to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ensed vvith true patience, that vve sink not vnder the burthen vvhen Gods scourges continue long vpon vs, for euen that also is one of the points of the amendment vvhich he requireth of vs. Neuerthelesse, it is a thing that cannot be learned else vvhere than in Gods vvord. For although the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers and other vvise men of the vvorld haue spoken of it and giuen certaine rules of it: yet vvas there neuer any man found that for all his learning therof in their schoole, could shevve that he knevve vvhat it is at the neede and vvhen it commeth to the putting of it in vre. And in very deede euen those that tooke vpon them (as I sayd) to teach others, besids that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine vvas vnperfect itself, most commonly vvist not vvhere they vvere vvhen it came to the point that they should haue practized it in daungers: &amp; those that did best, shevved I vvot not vvhat a resemblance of patience, vvhich being more neerly considered vvas cleane contrarie. Therfore not vvithout cause doeth the Apostle sainct Paule send vs too the vvhole scripture to learne patience and comfort: according also as in another text he sayeth, that the end of the scripture is to make a man perfect and readye in all good vvorks. But yet among the books of Scripture, the booke of IOB is commended to vs by name for that purpose by the Apostle Sainct Iames. And the verie bare reading of the storie, shevveth sufficiently that it is not vvith out cause. Neuerthelesse, it is not to bee doubted, but that the help of a good expounder is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable euen to the skilfullest, and likevvise necessarie in common, for the better knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vnderstanding of the diuersitie of the matters, and for the furtherance of a mannes ovvne profiting in the doctrine that is conteyned in it. That is it vvhich hath moued certaine goodmen, to put foorth his yeere. <hi>The Sermons of the faithfull seruant of God and his Churche Maister Iohn Caluin, vpon the booke of Iob,</hi> notvvithstanding that he himselfe vvhich is the author of them, and at vvhose mouth they vvere gathered, vvithstoode it as much as he could, according as hee hath done vvith his other Sermōs. Furthermore, although other mē of knovvledge haue trauelled to giue a more easie vnderstāding of this booke by their vvrytings, yet notvvithstāding, besides that these Sermons are in the common French toung: his maner of handling the doctrine thereof is so playne and vvell framed to the capacitie of the grossest sorte (as yee vvould terme them) hovvbeit vvithout omitting any needfull things, and moreouer so applied one vvay &amp; other to the behoof of the present time, that surely all suche as intend too iudge vprightly and vvithou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>malice, shall find good helpe heere, vvhervvith too content themselues. For profe vvherof, it is not novv needfull to shevv a summe of the booke, or of the chiefe points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and of the vse of the same diuerse vvays. For besides that he shall better find it here and there in reading his Sermons: the first conteyneth a sufficient discourse, and yet very short to be easly borne in mynd. Hovvsoeuer the cace stand, if those that read the vvhole, be folke that haue already left Idolatrie, and giuen themselues to the doctrine of the Gospell: they shall find
<pb facs="5"/>
heere vvhervvith to further themselues▪ still more and more in the knovvledge of God and of our Lord Iesus Christ, and specially too strengthen themselues vvith right patience in their aduersities. Or if they be such as haue not yet knovvne or listed to discerne the true Religion, to frame themselues therafter by leauing the false Religions, vvhat occasion so euer hath let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thē, yet being vvarned by the doctrine of this booke so chavved to them as they shall finde it, and cheefly being vvakened by Gods extraordinarie iudgement in Iobs persone, vvhiche they shall see there layde forth and declared at length: they shall be prepared to bethinke thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues better, &amp; to take profite of the great number of aduersities vvhich are seene novvadaies in the vvorlde, &amp; of farre greater vvhervvith it is verie likely that God threatneth men for the greate &amp; open despizing of his Gospell. For although the things that are happened this yeere, as well in his punishmēts layd vpō the vvicked sort &amp; the enimies of Christ, as in his chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments layd vpon the faithfull, be verie terrible: Yet notvvithstanding forasmuchas very fevve amende, and contrarivvise most men grovve more spitefull in fighting against Iesus Christ, and some hauing begonne to do vvell vvex rechelesse againe, yea &amp; viterly turne avvay: there is none other thing too bee looked for, but that he vvill continue to smite still. So then, the first sort shall haue to consider, that if Iob being a sound and rightuouse man that feared God and eschevved euill, (according as it is vvitnessed of him) and liuing so long tyme before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Iesus Christ and the great light of the Gospell, vvas handled so straungely at Gods hand vvho loued him: and that the same vvas too the end that his patience should be tried: it is no maruell though vve novv in these latter dayes, vnder the reigne of Iesus Christ, haue novv and then many crosses to beare, &amp; be for our peculiar faults chastized vvith strype vpon strype at the hand of the liuing God, vvho notvvithstanding loueth vs, for the seruing of vvhom according to his vvoord, vve be turned from ydolls vnto him, as sayth Sainct Paule to the Thessalonians. The second sort shall haue to thinke &amp; bethinke, yea &amp; to chavv as their cudde, that if God do so shake therodde in his hand ouer those that are already reclamed to his sure, to bridle them &amp; make them vvalke right frovvard throughout: &amp; that if he haue gone that vvay to vvorke vvith Iob as is reported heere, vvho notvvithstanding had bene as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell in the vvorld, in indeuering to do his dutie to God and man: VVhat is likely to lyght vpon themselues, if they do not in generall amend and vtterly forsake their foolish, shamefull, and vvicked idolatrie, aud particularly the manifest contempt of God vvherof they be full, liuing at this day as Epicures &amp; Atheists: &amp; moreouer, some their vvhordome &amp; bauderie, some their drunkennesse &amp; gluttonie, (according as there be some countries that are specially giuen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto) some their ambitiouse pompe, some their vaine vvorldlinesse, some their snatching and extortion as vvel pryuate as publike, &amp; othersome their crueltie and insatiable desire too shed mannes blud, in spight of all lavves and to the confusion of all ciuill order among men? They shall (say I) haue this little vvord of Sainct Peters to vvey, vvhich ought to astonish thē more than all the thunderclappes that euer rattled in the aire: that is to vvit, that if chastizemēt begin at the house of God, &amp; at those vvhich are the true Christians: vvhat shall the end of these be, vvhich rebell against Gods Gospell? &amp; if the rightuouse do hardly scape, vvhere shal the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and sinfull appeare? Behold the thing that all the good seruants of God, and all faithfull preachers of the Gospel do brotherly pray for at this day, as men haue done hertofore. Behold the thing that al the little flocks of the reformed churches dispersed heere &amp; there do pray for, behold, the thing that euen Iesus Christ (as yee vvould saye) in his ovvn person prayeth for: is that they may by him be reconcyled to God, &amp; receiue his grace in such vvise, as it may not be in vaine. And it is to be hoped that God of his great mercie vvil yet notvvithstanding bring many of that sort too such chaunge, as he vvill make them true and earnest follovvers of the Gospell, as he hath done oft heretofore. Notvvithstanding, if any or many of thē being so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for Iesus Christs sake, do harden themselues: let suche vnderst and that they shall not scape Gods hand at the last day, and it may be that they shall feele it yet sooner too their greate confusion. For it is he vvhose preheminence &amp; none others is in controuersie at this day: and vvhich shall of a truthe get the vpper hand of all his enimies early or late, vvhatsoeuer betyde. He is vvilling to haue pitie vpon his creatures, and by vvord he giueth comfort and patience to all such as are pinched: but specially he comforteth those that are already vnder his banner, graunting them to haue peace in him, although they haue none in the vvorld.</p>
