   <head>❧ To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Recantation made at Paules Crosse the day &amp; yere aboue written, is nowe published. I thought it expedient (good Christian Reader) to set out together withal, this short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course by waie of Praeface, for these respects which followe. First, that I might make a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of such necessarie points, which at the time of making my Recantation, (hauing but halfe an howre allowed me) I was enforced to omitt. Secondlie, that euerie good man, vnto whom the viewe of my recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall come, might thorowlie be satisfied of my vnfained meaning in the performance of this action: the which as it concerneth the euerlasting health or detriment of my soule, so of all other mē I were most miserable and wretched, if I should anie waies be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with hipocrisie or dissimulation. Thirdlie, that I might the better stop the slaunderous reports of the aduersarie whom I haue forsaken, whose pens and speeches (I am sure) will nowe bee so much the more vehement &amp; sharpe against me, by how much I am miraculously escaped and deliuered from them, who no doubt wil seeke to obscure the glory of God in this his wonderfull and prouident worke, and to defame me for the furtheraunce of their owne cause, all that they can.</p>
   <p>These respects mooued me to adde some-thing more for the perfectyng of the thing, that neyther that which I had purposed to haue spoken, might be
<pb n="28" facs="16"/> vnsayd, the Reader better satisfied, and the aduersarie ouerthrowen.</p>
   <p>As concerning the first poynt, wheras I could not in so small a portiō of time, set downe the causes that mooued me first to forsake the Pope, to suspecte his religiō, to make my vnsayned submissiō vnto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, together with the causes that brought me back againe: what the shortnes of time then forced me to omit, heere now I haue supplyed by my penne.</p>
   <p>The first and principall thing that mooued me to forsake the Pope, and to contemne his religion, (next vnto the great mercie and prouidence of almightie God) was his notorious trecheries &amp; vngodly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, against our moste gracious Queene and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: vnto the happie consideration wherof I came not, vntil such time as it pleased God to stoppe me of my course, (which was in raunging vppe and downe her Maiesties Realme, in sowing the seed not only of false doctrine, but also of sedition and rebellion) and bringing me into prison for as it is written, <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio dat intellectum, Tribulation giueth vnderstanding:</hi> &amp; finding my self within the daunger of her Maiesties lawes: I began better to consider the cause and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that I had taken in hand, remembring that saying of <hi>Cyprian: Non▪ paena sed causa facit martyrem,</hi> that is <hi>Not the payne but the cause maketh a Martir.</hi> I found that my cause did more concerne the Pope then any Religion, and that rather I was to be conuicted for matter of high Treason, then to be persecuted with any extremitie for matter of meere conscience: For that all the world knoweth, that her Maiestie neuer did put any to death for matter of meere conscience or Religion.</p>
   <p>In the consideration of my cause, which cheefely was for the defence of the Pope: I remembred how
<pb n="29" facs="16"/>
      <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. had excōmunicated her Ma. &amp; remoued so many of her subiects frō their dutiful &amp; natural o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as stoode perswaded of the authority of his accurssed censure: the which (to speak truly) my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science alwayes detested, &amp; hardly could my stomack be brought to dygest such an vnsauourye pill, vntill such time as by false perswasion, I was cōtaminate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. Beeing therfore (as I sayd) brought by the prouidence of God into prison: I came into this hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pie consideration, that the defending of the Pope his quarrell: would rather make me a Traitour then a Martir, &amp; that my cause would sooner prooue high Treason, then true Religion. For remembring the cause and effect of the Pope his excōmunicating of her Maiestie: I found it was nothing els, but to dispo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sesse her of her Crowne &amp; Royaltie, &amp; that Doctor <hi>Moorton,</hi> a man of little learning, and lesse Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after that he cāe into <hi>England</hi> to publish the same, who trauelling all the North partes: gaue authority generally vnto all the Priestes, to perswade her Ma. Subiects, as well in <hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> as in <hi>foro exteriori,</hi> (as they tearme it) to withdrawe their naturall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from their Prince, and to prepare them selues for rebellion. What effect this Excommunication wrought: the sequell declared by the Northen rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. I remembred also, that Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him: dealt a great deale more subtilly, &amp; more dangerously then his predecessour, for wheras Pope <hi>Pius</hi> had excommunicated her Ma. openly: <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. dispensed with all Papists, that it might be law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full outwardly to professe obedience, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge her Ma. their lawfull Queene &amp; Soueraigne: and yet inwardly to retayne a traiterous minde, and to practise all the tretcheries against her that they can. Examples of this matter I need not produce: the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="30" facs="17"/> and confessions of such as haue been executed for their treasons, can well witnes. I considered more ouer, the sending of <hi>Saunders</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of strangers for an inuasiō, &amp; how that <hi>Stukeley</hi> had beene imployed to the same purpose, had he not been as false to the Pope, as he was to his Soueraigne. These &amp; the like considerations, at what time I was first committed prysoner into the Counter, made me to suspect mine owne cause, &amp; quarrell that I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, and God assisting mee with his grace, I humbled my selfe, and did write a Letter of submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto an honorable Counseller of this Realme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I dyscouered my knowledge of such vile &amp; horrible practises, as I did knowe to be intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Ma. and the state. I dislyked the Pope &amp; his Religson, that noseled men vp in such abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable treasons, and desired to be better enstructed in matters of faith and saluation, and that I might come vnto a more true and godly profession, then before I was brought vp in. My petition was fauourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, I was not only pardoned mine offences: but I was also restored into grace and fauour: And thys was the first time.</p>
   <p>Thus hauing declared the first &amp; principall cause, that moued me to forsake the Pope and to exchange my religion: I shall in a woord or two set downe the causes that made mee to fall backe againe, the which (next vnto the prouidence of almightie God, that so had appointed it) was, as I breefly repeated in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, my corrupt affection: For hauing all the dayes of my life been trayned vp among Papists, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in their Schooles, and hearing continuallye their Sermons, reading their Bookes, and giuing my minde little or nothing vnto the studie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, refusing alwayes either to heare or to read any
<pb n="31" facs="17"/> thing that might contrary my first conceiued opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hauing all my freendes &amp; acquaintance of the Papists parte, thinking that I should be left desolate and naked when I were departed from them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more regard vnto the shame &amp; obloquie of the world, for altering my religion, then vnto the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a good conscience for my godly and wel doing, and not being so thankfull vnto almightie God for so great a benefit receiued, as I ought, or so carefull to preserue my selfe from the daunger of falling into the like offence agayne, not hauing my soule thorowlye clensed from the dregges of corrupt affection: And falling into the companye of such, as I could not bee but greatly endangered by them, partly by perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partly by flatterie, partlye by fayre promises, &amp; partly by intreaty: I was at the length so bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as (forgetting my dutie vnto God, my allegeance vnto my Prince, and looue vnto my Countrey) I con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>discended to returne vnto the Pope agayne, and then God with-drawing from me his grace: I was not so well minded before, as I became nought &amp; corrupt afterward, nor did not so well acknowledge a truthe, shew a repentaunce, and make a submission: as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured afterward to heape lye vpon lye, in slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of my selfe, in defending the Pope, and in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooing of all the good which before I had doone. In the which minde, after that I had framed an Epistle vnto her Ma. for to excuse the Pope, his Seminarie Priests, and to father slaunders on my selfe &amp; other men, and had written an Apologie and other Libels to that effect, I was speedilie conuaied out of the Realme, thinking first to haue trauailed to <hi>Rheames,</hi> and afterwarde to <hi>Rome.</hi> And directing first my course into <hi>Scotlande,</hi> (for that I feared to finde anie secure passage at any English Porte) I came to <hi>Leeth</hi>
      <pb n="32" facs="18"/> of purpose, there to take shypping for <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but finding no passage readie, I tooke the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie offered mee in a Flie-boate to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> in the which after I had sayled fiue or sixe daies, and comming neere vnto lande, behold, there happened such a suddaine tempest &amp; storme, that neither Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Mariner, or passenger, thought euer that hee shold haue escaped drowning. I seeing the imminēt perrill and danger, I called to memorie the dysobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient fact of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who beeing commaunded of God to goe vnto <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>uie,</hi> transported himselfe towardes <hi>Tharsis:</hi> who with the like tempest was punished of almightie GOD for his transgression; I applyed the example vnto my selfe, I thought I had gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie offended in forsaking my Countrey, &amp; falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my faith vnto GOD and my Prince I vowed, that if it would please God to deliuer mee from that present danger, and to saue the whole company that they might not perrish for mee, I woulde desist my purposed iourney, and returne againe into Englande with what perril soeuer. To be short, it pleased God to heare my petition wee came safe to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> where after I had remained awhile, I repayred vnto her Ma. Comissioners that were come thether, who can beare witnes of my repentaunce. Not long after, I came back of mine owne accord into England, and submitted my selfe vnto her Maiesties mercie. Her highnes graciouslie pardoned mine offence, and so was I restored vnto grace againe, and this was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</p>
   <p>Good Lord, what should be the cause of my fall againe? <hi>O altitudo diuitiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei. O wonderfull depth of Gods profounde Iustice and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> My time was not yet come that I was to bee called effectuallie, something yet remained that God
<pb n="33" facs="18"/> would haue perfected and doone, for the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of his glorie, for the which hee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to fall more miserably thē before I had done. And like as <hi>Peter</hi> became worse &amp; worse in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of his Maister, and neuer repented him vntyll Christ looked backe vppon him againe: euen so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came I worse then euer before I had beene, and was past all hope almost of repentaunce, had not Christ looked backe vppon me in the very last moment of time: for being fallen into the peruersitie of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion, neither feare of death, shame of the world, long imprisonment, could once alter mee, but if I had beene called vnto my tryall anie time within halfe a yeere after, I had I thinke, died as obstinatlie as anie before me had doone. Howe it pleased God at the last to conuert me, I haue set downe in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, I neede not heere report it againe, &amp; thus much I thought good to make a supplie of that, which if time had permitted me, shoulde haue beene deliuered at such time as I made my publike recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: the which once I had thought altogether to haue concealed, but that I remembred, that <hi>Secretum Regis abscondere, bonum est, opera autem Dei reuelare, honorificum:</hi> that is, <hi>To conceale the secret of the King, is a good thing, but to manifest the wonderfull workes of almightie God, is a most honorable thing.</hi> Now come I to the second cause, to giue thee (Gentle Reader) a fuller satisfaction, that my former recantation hath beene doone without all hypocrisie or dyssimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
   <p>As my recantation was publicke, and before an honourable, worshipfull, and woorthy assembly, so I hope that their harts were so mooued, that most of them we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e enclined vnto pittie &amp; compassion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, such as heard me not, &amp; shall onely peruse this
<pb n="34" facs="19"/> dombe Letter. I knowe not howe they may stande perswaded of my true and faithfull meaning, and the more hardlie they may be incensed against me, when perhaps they shall heare of my former Lybelles and Letters written in the defence of the Pope, and all Seminarie Priests, at such time as I was returned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pope again; that hauing written so vehemēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in their behalfe, in reproofe of my selfe and myne owne confessions, with protestations that all that I had doone, was but in deepe hypocrisie &amp; dyssimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and now affirming the cleene contrary, may yet suspect me of double dealing, and stand in doubt what to beleeue. For if I did saie true then, I must dissemble now: and if I saie true now, I coulde not but write falshoode then. For thy better satisfaction in this point (good Christian Reader) least thy good opinion of mee might be carried awaie by the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent practise of the enemie againe, I haue sette downe the true causes that moued me first to reiect the Pope, hoping that they be such, as no honest or good man may denie them: which beeing found to be true in the sight and knowledge of euery man, I leaue it then for the indifferent Reader to iudge, whether I had iust cause to forsake the Pope as I did, &amp; whether I haue written anie slaunder against him. His dooings beeing far worse then that I haue alreadie spoken, and whether I had good cause to suspect his religion, sith that our Sauiour saith, <hi>That euerie Tree is knowne by his fruite,</hi> and the fruites that the Pope yeeldeth, beeing nothing els but horrible practises and Treasons, I see not but that the Tree (as I said in my recantation) together with the body and braunches, is to be hewen downe.</p>
   <p>As for my Lybels and writings that I haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made in his defence, the more they rome
<pb n="35" facs="19"/> with protestations, the more a wise man hath cause to suspect them; for surelie they come all from that foule spirit which first was throwne out, and beeing returned againe, he brought seauen worse then him selfe to hold more sure possessiō. But consider (good Christian Reader) the wonderfull power and mercy of almightie GOD, in this one onely thing. Had I beene assured that I had setled my former fayth and Religion vppon a stable grounde, had not my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science cryed out against mee, at what time the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD did effectuallie touch mee, woulde I (thinke you) after that I had wilfully forsaken the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and mercies of my Prince, the libertie of my Countrey, the possibilitie of preferments, and after I had so desperatlie committed my selfe vnto the open shame and obloquie of the world, to the daunger of death, &amp; in the extreamitie of sicknes when I could hope for no life, haue repented mee of that which I had doone, and make such a ditection of my faulte, &amp; such a publique recantation as I haue doone, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I thinke no wise or reasonable man woulde euer thinke it; and therfore, if this be not a sufficient and a strong argument to prooue my vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, I can but crie with the Prophet, <hi>Iudica me Deus, er discerne causam meam, Iudge me O Lorde, and dyscerne my cause.</hi> I can but referre the matter vnto thee heauenlie Iudge, that in the latter day must iudge me and all man kinde: and thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fulnes of satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Now lastlie I thought good to sette out this Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face for to encounter the enemie, who as I heare, hath published in Print my former Lybels, subscry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with mine owne hande, for the which I giue by these presents al the world to vnderstand, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I haue written heeretofore in the defence of
<pb n="36" facs="20"/> the Pope, it hath beene in the time of my seduction, in the zeale of Papistrie, and therefore those wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are not to bee regarded of anie wise or godlie person. And truelie the Papists haue deceiued thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the publishing of those Pamphlets: for, if Charitie coulde not haue perswaded thē to conceale them, me thinkes that policie shoulde, for they doe but minister matter vnto me to aunswer them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I shall be constrained to lay open their nakednes, which otherwise I thought to haue couered, &amp; they heape moe coales on their owne heads then they bee aware of. I saie no more at this time, vntill I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand further what they haue doone. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing absolued so much as I thought necessarie to ad by waie of Praeface, I doe referre thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) vnto the Recantation it selfe, crauing pardon if I haue troubled thee ouer long. From my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at S. Katherins the 31. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Anno. Domi. 1588.</hi>
