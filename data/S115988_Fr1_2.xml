<pb facs="4"/>
and experienced liue retired, attending their vocation by the Magistrate: of which number I professe my selfe in my facultie to bee one, who hauing these fortie yeares amongst many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most commendable exercises and inuentions of so warlike Engines, founde out diuers deuises of rare seruice, both for Sea and land, some whereof (whose charge exceeded not my small abilitie) I haue performed and made the vse thereof knowen vnto many my honourable, skilfull and experienced good friendes at home, and to some Princes beyonde the Seas, whereof ignoraunt persons hauing by chaunce light on some Modules or Patternes of small importance imperfect, haue vainely arrogated the inuention vnto themselues; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any sorte the vse and force thereof in seruice, making therby great aduantage to themselues by abusing superiour Authoritie with these imperfect first Elements of my preparations to greater matters; supplying the lamenes and effects thereof, by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and mellicious friuolous discourses, wherin there is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to any purpose: seeking to reape thereby the fruites of my chargeable and painefull labours; &amp; my name in the meane time neuer once brought in question: Such is and hath beene the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, and shameles boldnes of ignorant persons in all times fit to be restrayned, least greater mischiefes and inconueniences ensue thereby, when occasion requireth due triall to be made of their sufficiencie, and the right vse of these rare Experiments. But to leaue (most gratious <hi>SOVERAIGNE)</hi> the consideration of these important causes vnto the deepe wisedome and discreete prouidence of your <hi>HIGHNES</hi> owne carefull foresight, and the ordering and reformation thereof to such as are in authoritie: And to returne to my purpose; among many studious inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereunto I haue bent my minde as well for the seruice of my countrie, when time shall serue, as for mine owne satisfaction; Looking withall into some parte of the rare inscrutable secrets of naturall Phlosophie, and falling sometimes to the charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, paynefull, and fruiteles practise thereof▪ by distillation, and other transmutation of Plants, Hearbs, Stones and Mineralls of all sortes: ayming at that marke, which many learned and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Clearks than my selfe haue shot at, and yet missed; J haue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by the way light (to my singuler cōtentment) on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite rare conclusions, both profitable, pleasant, and seruiceable; so that although my simple skill could not attaine to such perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as J desired, yet haue I no cause to repent me any way of my trauells therein imployed but rather great occasion to lament me of my long discontinuance from the same, by losse of many yeares spent vnprofitably in a laborinth of law suites, and priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with men of verie great abilitie, and better friended than my selfe, wherein now vtterly wearyed, and worne out of heart, through the greatnes of my aduersaries purse and friendes, J am now forced for want of abilitie, after ten yeares chargeable suite, to relinquish the same, and to returne to those my delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble studies and seruiceable exercises againe, as well to digest melancholick conceipts, as to keepe olde age from such extream wants, as the iniquitie of times, the tedious greeuance by delayes, the striuing against strōg armes wil bring; the least able to weary afar welthier man than my selfe, hoping yet to recouer some parte of my lost time, and (if abilitie altogether faile me not before I die,) to make vnto your <hi>MAIESTIE</hi> some rare Present by experiments <hi>Chimicall</hi> or <hi>Martiall,</hi> such as hitherto hath not been performed by any other. Wherefore (most gracious <hi>SOVERAIGNE)</hi> desiring hencefoorth to employ the rest of my shorte course, in more serious sorte, to the seruice of GOD, your <hi>MAIESTIE,</hi> and my Countrey, &amp; by all meanes I can possible to profit some wayes this Royall kingdome and State, (wherein I haue liued these threescore yeares and more) I am bolde to publish this rare worke of learned <hi>Ripley</hi> vnder your <hi>MAIESTIES</hi> protection for the instruction and direction of all studentes, and louers of the secreat Mysteryes of naturall Philosoophie; deliuering most compendiously the hidden Arte and high Mysterie of making the Philosophers Stone, (sought for by many thousandes in all ages, but founde of very fewe, and they such as rapte with the excellency thereof, haue in contempt of the worlde, retired themselues from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

societie, keeping the same most secret to themselues, esteeming the world not worthy of so precious a Iewell.
