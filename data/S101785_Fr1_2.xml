   <head>❧ To the most high <hi>and mighty Prince,</hi> Henry, Prince of Great Britaine, Sonne <hi>and Heire Apparant to our</hi> Soueraigne Lord the King.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost gratious and happy</hi> Prince: not long sithence a certaine Religious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman asked me two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions touching those weightie wordes of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>1. Corin. 11. Let euery man therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, &amp; drinke of this cup.</hi> The first was: whether euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be bound of necessitie to examine themselues before they doe receiue the Lords Supper or not.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>The second was: wherein that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of euery ones selfe dooth consist, or what the points bee, which euery Christian by this examination must find in himselfe, before hee can receiue ahe Lords Supper.</p>
   <p>Two questions, deseruing a very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full answer, because they are as great and as needfull, as euer any can be in these daies.</p>
   <p>The former toucheth the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Atheist, who is wont, to presume to the Lordes holy Supper, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what hee doeth. The latter concernes the blinde ignorant sort, which are wont thither to flocke (it is a wonder to see) not knowing, what they doe. By both which, this great Sacrament is euery where fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abused, and the breaches of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the ruines of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become most lamentable.</p>
   <p>For this cause, at that time with
<pb facs="3"/> my best endeuour, I answered the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions in our priuate conference toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all such doubts and obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as did arise from, and were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by that our speech. Sithence, I handled the same abroad by publike preaching, as occasion was offered, which heard: I vnderstood, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were delighted in the diuine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Many much reioyced at the plaine and easie order, affirming, that they had red sundry godly writings of the same argument, &amp; heard diuers learnedly entreating of those words of the Apostle: but that the way to the performance of this duty of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was neuer tracted so plain, so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, so easie. Lastly therefore, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what hurt the hiding vp of this simple Talent may do: &amp; againe, what gaine and profite the occupying of the same abroad by Sea &amp; land, through Gods blessing might bring vnto his Church,
<pb facs="4"/> I thought best for that end to put pen to paper, and humbly to dedicate the same to you (most noble Prince) especially for two causes,</p>
   <p>The first and chiefest is: after your most noble Father, our most gratious Soueraigne King <hi>Iames,</hi> whom God long preserue, you are our next glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some hope, to gouerne these Realmes and Kingdomes with wholesome Lawes, and chiefly with sincere loue vnto Gods true Religion, whereof this little booke containes a part: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (I hope) your gratious clemencie will not onely take well in worth my good will and meaning, but also will put thereto the signet of your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly licence and allowance, vnder which this little Talent, <hi>Quod sentio, quam sit exiguum,</hi> may passe, be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and vsed, the rather because it is the marchandise of heauens king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>The other cause is: as my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father Doctor <hi>Tye</hi> was Tutor to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> afterward King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixt: so likewise, though I neither desire, nor deserue the like place, yet am I glad (most noble Prince) to shew any token of mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained hartie dutie &amp; loue vnto your Grace, whereby (so farre as I may be bold) I might bid you hearty welcome into these your Fathers Dominions: wherein in my daily praiers, I humbly craue of almightie God, in all happie peace to establish his excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and his royall Progenie euen to the worlds end.</p>
