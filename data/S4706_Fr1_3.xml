      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He opinions be manifold, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments multitudes, gentill Reader, that the diuersity of pregnant wits haue brought forth in this age, and euery of those instruments serue for some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conclusions; but I happely finding the contriuing of an instrument not bound to any particulars, but free, apt and generall, so that he is most fit to worke, most facill in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and most easy to cary; out of my loue to those that long after these arts, I could doe no lesse then commit it vnto their reading, hoping as my intent was to benefite them with my labours, so likewise they will graint a fauorable vouchsafe to requite my paines, and that is all I seeke; which finding, I will answere then that this booke shall teach them to seeke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions, both Astronomicall and Geometricall, to platte and measure grounds, both Arithmeticall and Mechanicall, in such a compendious method, that the vnlearned neuer trained in the studies of these artes before, may with admiration accomplish those things that learned men haue passed ouer the moety of their liues to find out. And if this instrument please you not, you may turne further, and looke vpon the <hi>Topographical glasse,</hi> an instrument no lesse singular and commendable then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and for your practise whereon I haue set downe many <hi>Topographicall</hi> and <hi>Geodeticall</hi> conclusions, which because I aime to sute you with varieteis, behold the vse of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitus, the circumferent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And since euery one that writeth a booke of any materiall consequence, disputeth first, and shewes what necessary commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity may accrew to the reader, lest other wise it be held imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and nothing commodious for the common wealth, (the aduancement whereof, all men are bound in Christianity to tender;) it shall therefore nothing distaste, briefly to remember the same. First then enqure of the Souldier, a chiefe defendant of his country, if he be not taught hereby to dispose of plats, castles, forts, citties, and such like, to appoint places conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the campe, &amp; to proportion euery part according to the number of men and horse: let the Politician speake of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and allowances, let Architectors speake of plattes and symmetries, let the the pioners speake of conducting mines and vaults vnder the earth, for the blowing vp of citties, forts and castles; let the Nauagators speake of true directions in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen path of the seas, yea let all men speake of what vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on soeuer, and they shall find diuersity of matter, as well to exercise the head, as recreate the wit. Amongst many, I will shut vp this argument with the Geodetor or measurer of land, whose antiquity is great, as we may perceiue by <hi>Zachary,</hi> Chap. <hi>2,</hi> questioning with a man that was meating <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and whose commodity is no lesse great then ancient, as may appeare by the exundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Aegipt:</hi> for when al the bounds and limits of euery seuerall mans particular was drowned and buried in the slime and mudde remaining after the recourse of the floud, by the true direction of this science, euery man was allotted his proper quantity of ground in the same proportion it was before. Then let none grudge if we teach them the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and hid secrets of so necessary and rare an art, so beneficiall for man and so requisite in a common wealth, so conuenient to be knowen of some, and expedient to be credited of al, teaching nothing but truth and certainties, approued by inuincible grounds of infallable Geometricall demonstrations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not stagger to inserte it, as an associate to iustice, one of the foure cardinall vertues, whose office, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>1 de Officiis: Quae nihil alienum vendicat, quae cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet

      </gap>eyed to be, such paltry bils I saw my selfe in London some three or foure yeares since, much disgracing the arte: for either they must affirme they may lye by arte, or else can enlarge the true bounds of the Manour by art. But the first platte beeing truly taken, this assertion must needs be false<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> but I can no more blame them to auouch this in their bils, then they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the paisting of them vpon euery post: shall we now turne the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But now for soath, he that can but get an old plaine Table, and measure a meadow (how vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rue soeuer) is a <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metritian,</hi> though by profession a homely Carpenter or rude
<pb facs="6"/>Mason, and he that can but find the ordinary place of a planet in an <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> is an <hi>Astronomer,</hi> though otherwise a poore tradesman, of wit scarce enough to get his owne living; thus is art troden downe with presumption, and the world possest with errours. I haue heard diuers assertions and childish assumptions of such artlesse fellowes, though my selfe being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to them; some will produce you a pretty small brazen instrument forth of their pocket, and will affirme with that to goe into the middest of any field, and presently tell how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acres be in the same before he stirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, neither will he vse the helpe of any cheine: which is nothing but meere foolish surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and rude presumption, as farre out of their ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, as they are from the vnderstanding of the art, possessing the world with impossibilities and boasting affirmations. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse by Art such a thing may be performed, so the medowe be plaine, and of a small quantity, but is not to be spoken in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, or as a necessary or speedy conclusion.</p>
   <p>Now some there are that will abruptly say, this surueying maketh the poore Tenants haue hard bargaines, whereby all things grow scarce and deare. I answer, no: In what part of iustice is it that the Lord should be ignorant of his owne? doth his knowledge abridge his conscience? how then is ignorance the mother of transgression? is it not seene that many men of good conscience by ouer estimating their lands, let their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants more then hard peniworths? the randon is no scantell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> can the tradesman set his friend a reasonable price of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, when he is both ignorant of the quantity and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the commodity he selleth, whenas! knoweth both? the vsing of his friend relleth in the goodnesse of his conscience, so is it with the Lord and Tenant, and that the measuring of grounds should bring dearth, is as false as the former. For if the tenant will couenant with the Lord, that he shall haue all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at the price they were in yeares past, the Lord will likewise promise the Tenant the like rate of his lands; but if all things grow to a farre higher rate then formerly they were, shall onely land be bound to rest at the old stint? shall euery
<pb facs="6"/>tradesman inhaunce the prizes of their wares, and onely the reuenews of gentlemen be rated? must euery one haue free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make the best of his owne, and onely Landlords appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned? It is a peeuish obseruation and foolish lenity so to doe, &amp; is a principall cause wherfore so many tradesmen creepe into the ancient possessions of Gentlemen; yet notwithstanding it is most requisite that the Lord vse a fauorable improuement, for so to doe is acceptable before God and man: and therefore the Geodetor ought to yeeld a conscionable &amp; true information to the Lord. But gentill Reader to conclude, let sparing reproofe assure me of kind acceptance, and then haply I shall be induced the rather to publish the flowers of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> not yet finished, with another instrument called <hi>Clauis Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi> or the key of the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> for that it vnlocketh as it were all <hi>Mathematicall</hi> questions, laying them in a plaine method open vnto thy view; the meane time I rest ready to doe thee any fauour I may,</p>
