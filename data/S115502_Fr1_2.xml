      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene an ancient custom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of worthy friends deceased, therby to continue
<pb facs="3"/> the remembrance of their vertues, persons, and love. This holy Treatise ensuing, hath served you to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and that very fitly; for herein you have a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your most worthy and loving Brother, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the most noble and worthy part of him, I meane of his excellent understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mysterie of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: his most zealous and earnest will and desire of all mens practice of godlinesse; And his sincere love unto you in particular, unto whom hee primarily directed these
<pb facs="3"/> Directions unto a godly life; which as they do lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that he had put on the new man, created and renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in knowledge, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and true holinesse: so is it most worthy of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, both for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and imitation of him. Yea, I may confidently affirme, that this faithfull remembrancer is most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and fit alwaies to be carried about us, and daily to be look'd on by us: for it will helpe us well to put on that new man, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our Head Iesus Christ, and to walke before
<pb facs="4"/> the Lord in holinesse and righteousnesse all the daies of our life. For there is this difference between those former corporall Images of earthly bodies and this, that men with too much love and use of them, easily fell into superstitious wickednesse; but this the more it is loved and used of men, the more will all wickednesse be rooted out of their hearts, and the more will they glorifie God by a holy life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now having received this holy Treatise at your worships hands to publish it unto the World, I am bold to
<pb facs="4"/> returne it unto you for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, both that the World may know unto whom it is obliged for so excellent a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, as also for the great benefit that shall be reaped thereby. So (Sir) accounting it a wise part in him that cannot speake well, to say but little; I commend you and this Treatise to Gods Grace which is able to build us up further, even to doe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously above all that wee can aske or thinke.</p>
