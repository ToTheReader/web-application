   <p>AFter I had read this confession, &amp; seene the great rytches of spiritual doctrine which is therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I thought I shoulde do a thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and also profitable, if for your comfort I dyd make a Table, setting in order the principall matter contayned herein, the which thing I did for your commoditie and easynes, reade it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with dilygence: O would to God that King, prince and other noble par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of the worlde which be so ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill informed of the doctrine whiche we teache (by those which serue in the Church for their bellyes sake) woulde vouchsafe to haue patience to reade or cause to heare read that which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in cōtained: and I beleeue they would not be so angrie, nor haue so euyll opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of vs as they haue. But some wyll take good hede inough to beware that

the wynde of those Bookes shall not touch such estates. For if they do some of them wyll not laugh at it in the end. Nowe God which hath the hartes of Kinges in his hande, graunt them his spyrite of prudence and dyscretion to discerne the lyght from darknesse, and geue place to the King of Kinges, the Lord Iesus Christ, whose lieuetenants they be, that he maye rayne peaceable among his by the scepter of his worde, and that all humaine traditions and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions full of Idolatrie, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away and throwen downe.</p>
