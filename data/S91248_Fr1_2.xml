      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F two things whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thē I may do (right reuerend Father) I stand greatly in doubt, whether I maye prosecute my purpose whicb I haue taken in hand: or els ceasse with silence and leue it in obliuion. For such is the curiousnes of this captius age, that the things which are doon and setforth to the vew of men,
<pb facs="5"/> must either with eloquence sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the common stile of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or els bee some new thing which hath not been heard of be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore.</p>
   <p>But I which of knowledge am thin, of learning base, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence rude, and neuer traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led further for the increase of good letters then the shadow of my deer brother Francis Cox (whome I heer name, partely for the dutyes sake I owe vnto him, and partely because I am assured of the fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which your Lordship doth beare vnto him) might seem to begin preposterously if I shuld
<pb facs="5"/> take vpon me to satisfie the curi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous appetite of the contētlesse tīe. But yet hauīg read &amp; read ouer again this litle book of D. Henry Bullinger whiche hee compiled and published in his owne naturall tung, for the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting of those stormes that blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in Heluetia, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the discorde and variance now present in the Churche of Englād, stirred vp by the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse heds of such as neuer could be quiet, &amp; cōsidering with my self the effects therof and finall wrapping vp if in time they be not looked vnto: I haue chosen rather with my plain speech &amp;
<pb facs="6"/> simple skil to english this book so eloquently turned into latin by that excellent learnedman, Iosias Simlerus, and so to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit my contrie, then for want of sufficient furniture to let this worthy woork lye hidden from my contrie, buried as it were in the bosōe of an vnknowē speche to the multitude.</p>
   <p>I thinck it the duty of all good christians &amp; faithful Subiects (my singuler good Lord) to do what lyeth in thē to the increace and confirming of concord the true nurse of all florishing com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon weales. For what hart so hard bledeth not? what eie so dry
<pb facs="6"/> weepeth not: what man so void of sence trembleth not to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the calamities and miseries of contention? For what slaugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of infants, what murder of aged, what spoile of people, what hauock of nations, what ruin of Countries, what rauin of kingdōes, what vtter deuasta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of gouernment and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires commeth by dissention &amp; discord, the contries adioyning vnto vs are an example, their Princely Lords a Spectacle, their goods and possessions a caueat vnto vs.</p>
