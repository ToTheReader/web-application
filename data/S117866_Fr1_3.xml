      </note> Petrus Bizarus an Italian writing the historie of Genua, and vpon occasion mentioning her Maiestie, doth compare her to Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander Seuerus, a most famous prince for his clemencie and other vertues, and testifieth, that for twenty yeeres <hi>she gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her kingdome without blood, not suffering any to be punished, but by lawfull triall, and sentence of iudges.</hi> The which is testified by as many, as then knewe her gouernment, and by euidence of things then passed. For so long as papists did content themselues with their popish conceites and opinions, although many of them were false, absurd, and blasphemous; yet neither did she seeke to ensnare them by new lawes, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the rigour of olde lawes against heretikes, yet in force, against them.</p>
   <p>In the meane while Thomas Harding<note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>Anno</hi> 1567.</note> obtained a bull from the pope, <hi>to exercise episcopall iurisdiction in England, to dispense with irregularities, and to receiue all, that would be reconciled to the pope.</hi> Which was nothing else, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a rebellion, which broke foorth two yeeres after. For all that were reconciled to the pope, renounced their obedience to the prince, as their actions did declare. In the yeere <hi>1569.</hi> Nicholas Morton was sent into England, to stirre the earles of Westmerland and Northumberland, and as many, as he could, to an open rebellion: which<note n="c" place="margin">By Sanders his conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ssion it appeereth, that popish priestes come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land to stir vp rebellion.</note> Sanders in his booke de visibili monarchia, plainly telleth, that we should not be ignorant, why fugitiue priestes come ouer into England. These seditious fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
<pb facs="8"/> did make no small flame in the north partes, and laide plots to stirre other partes of England to discontentment, had not God crossed their desseines.</p>
   <p>All this notwithstanding, albeit popish religion, and the proper marks of it began now to be made marks of faction, and that her Maiestie saw by diuers practises in England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that papistes did seeke her life, and the destruction of her kingdome, and that the Iesuites and priestes that were sent from Rome, came for no other purpose, then to practise against her life and the state; yet did she giue life to diuers rebels and traitors, refusing mercie to none, but such as refused to accept her fauour and mercie. At<note place="margin">Rishtons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And now she keepeth diuers aliue, that if they had, either her Maiestie in their power, or others, whom they finde contrarie to their purposes, would not spare their liues one hower: nor content themselues with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie reuenge.</p>
   <p>As for obstinate recusants, which (no doubt) for the most part<note place="margin">This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th by diuers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>are secretly reconciled to the pope, and adhere to her enemies,</hi> yet doe they enioy their landes, and goodes, and countrie, and in effect their libertie; and are onely subiect to pecuniarie punishments, which either they escape, not being endited through fauour, or by sleightes auoyding the endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by conueyance of their landes frustrating the lawe, or compounding for their punishment.</p>
   <p>Compare her Maiesties actions with the cruell procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of papists; and you shall soone see an exceeding great difference. She<note place="margin">This is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

She spareth notorious teachers of popish heresies, and inflicteth only pecuniarie mulctes vpon malcontent recusants,
<pb facs="8"/> that plainly disallow her gouernment;<note n="g" place="margin">The massacre of France and Flanders wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes this.</note> they kill man, woman and childe, that shall professe true religion. She onely defendeth her selfe against those, that are sent to perturbe the peace of her gouernment; they by tormentes and rackes seeke out pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible persons, and execute them to death most cruelly. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth according to law, these contrarie to all lawes<note n="h" place="margin">Hist. Natalis Comit.</note> massacre men, women, and children, whom they suspect to be contrarie to themselues in opinion.</p>
   <p>Which clemencie of her Maiestie, if it had either beene well accepted of forreine nations abroad, or else had mollified the harts of disloyall papists at home, all men would haue well liked, and magnified. But seeing this extraordinarie fauour, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remissenesse of lawes and iustice towards them hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed diuers rebellions both in England and Ireland, and made them bold to attempt against her Maiesties life and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and giuen some of them courage to conspire with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine enemies, and hardened the harts of our enemies against vs, and weakened the hands of such, as otherwise would haue beene forward inough to attempt against them; and finally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued the sinewes of gouernment in suffering malcontents to practise and not maintaining the present state, and executing lawes against offenders: many doe thinke that against such persons, that are so euill disposed, and so firmly linked to forreine enemies, good iustice is most necessarie, and that it is farre more profitable and expedient, to execute lawes, then to pardon such offenders. For while such vipers are suffered to gnawe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of their mother, and yet are not punished; and malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents suffered to degorge their poyson against religion, lawes, gouernment, magistrates, ministers of the church, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men; it is no maruell, though the number of disloyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects encrease, and though well affected and honest men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe themselues, and rest discouraged. Now of late they<note n="i" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> appeareth by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of their libels, diuersly mentioned in this treatise.</note> haue taken to themselues a presumptuous and audacious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, not onely to speake their pleasure of her Maiestie, and
<pb facs="9"/> her lawes and good friends, but also to aduance the cause of the publike enemies of the state. Edward Rishton a Seminarie priest was no sooner by her Maiesties fauour<note n="k" place="margin">He set out Sanders booke, <hi>De schismate,</hi> and augmented it with infinite lies and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> deliuered out of prison, and from the danger of death, which he had well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, but he published against her and her Maiesties noble father and brother a most odious and railing libell deuoide of all truth and honestie, and for more credit to it, set it out vnder Nicholas Sanders his name and authoritie after his death. This course was also taken by Nicholas Harpesfield, who enioying libertie to doe what him listed, abused his libertie to raile on his prince and countrie. These are the men, that goe about to make their nation, and this gouernment infamous and odious to all posteritie. And thus we giue life and libertie to those that seeke nothing more, then to depriue vs of life, and good name.</p>
   <p>Nay they are lately growne so insolent, that they dare not onely taxe and raile at religion, and gouernment, but also reuell at all those, that once beginne to open their mouth in defence of the truth of her Maiestie, of iustice, and of their countrie; and not onely that, but also presume to offer their paltrie pamphlets to the view and consideration of the Lordes of her Maiesties counsell, which are the chiefe maintainers of religion and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. And that this is most true, we neede no further proofe, then a certaine treatise entituled a <hi>Wardeword,</hi> and written in outward shew against Sir Francis Hastings, but in very truth against religion, and this gouernment.</p>
   <p>This good Knight of a right zealous minde toward reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a loyall and louing affection towardes her Maiestie and the state, giueth the word to his countreymen, and stirreth vp such as sleepe in too much securitie, to consider the malice of the Pope, the preparations of the Spanyards, and the trecherie of Spaniolized papistes, that either at home or abroade enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intelligence with them: and seeing forreine enemies seeke by force to take the crowne from her Maiestie, and to
<pb facs="9"/> subuert the state, and to plant not onely false religion, but also an absolute tyrannie in this land; he exhorteth all loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and true English willingly to aduenture their liues, and to spend their goodes in defence of their religion, prince and countrie. He aduiseth also all true Christians diligently to watch, and to beware of the trecherous practises of priestes, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, rinegued English, and their consortes, as meaning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the subuersion of religion and state. In all which discourse, what one sentence can be noted vnwoorthie either a true Christian, or a loyall subiect, or a woorthie knight? Is it not lawfull to oppose himselfe against publike enemies and traitors, and to shew his affection toward his prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie? Sure, this our counterfeit N.D. whose name Parsons the Iesuite doth borrow, as he doth the name of Dolman other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, is very much offended, that either our knight should open his mouth in defence of the state, or offer himselfe readie to resist the publike enemies thereof. Nay further he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Pope and Spaniard, and maintaineth the cause of knowne traitors, and raileth at all, that dare speake any thing against them. Wherein I neede not note vnto you either his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious follie, that shewing himselfe a professed enemie of his prince and countrie, yet thinketh to obtaine fauour for his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes the papistes at the princes handes, or their boldnes, that vaunt of this champion, when no man can like him, but must needes shew a dislike of his prince and countrie, and bewray himselfe to be an enemie to the state. But I doe the rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto you the summe of this mans pleading, that you may the better vnderstand the boldnesse and impudencie of this generation, and how through our owne remissenesse wee haue suffered them to grow to this height of insolencie.</p>
   <p>He appealeth to the Lordes of her Maiesties counsell; and I hope they will censure such a rayling libeller and lewde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion according to his deserts. My selfe also doe commende vnto them this whole cause, and doubt not, but they will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
<pb facs="10"/> consider the pride of the enemie, and the necessitie of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: &amp; that all magistates &amp; good subiects wil concurre with them in this case. Clemencie and debonnairetie is very cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; but to suffer either Gods honor to be violated through idolatrie or superstition, or the Christian magistrates life or person to be endangered; or the commonwealth to be vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of due punishment of offenders, is not to be termed clemencie, but rather a remissenesse and dissolution of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither well agreeing with religion, nor ciuill policie.<note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.</note> Asa king of Iudah is commended, <hi>for that his hart was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with the Lord al his daies:</hi> yet was it no smal blemish to him, <hi>that he put not downe the high places,</hi> where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had established another worship, then that which the Lord had appointed. Manasses likewise, although vpon his returne from Babylon, he reformed religion and setled matters in Gods temple; yet is he<note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.</note> noted, for that he suffered the people <hi>to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in high places.</hi> For idolatrous worship is not to be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in any corner, nor by conniuencie to be dissembled.</p>
   <p>Neither is it policie to giue too much libertie to such as giue open signes of malcontentment, and either secretly vndermine the state, or publikely transgresse lawes. <hi>That state,</hi> saith<note n="n" place="margin">In orat. Aeschin.</note> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schines, <hi>is good for nothing, that hath no strength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse offenders against lawe.</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Neither is there any greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie in a state, as saith Euripides, then when malcontents and offenders are suffered to flourish. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Tullie saith, that dangerous and disobedient subiects, are with mulctes, imprisonment, and corporall punishment to be restrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Magistratus,</hi> saith<note n="o" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de legibus.</note> he, <hi>nec obedientem &amp; noxium ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uem multâ, vinculis, verberibusque coercento.</hi> Neither can any commonwealth be maintained, but where there is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence of punishment to transgression of lawes. <hi>Noxiae par poena esto,</hi> saith a wise<note n="p" place="margin">Cicero lib. <hi>3.</hi> de legib.</note> politike. And so respectiue were the Romaine lawes in this point, that where by sleight, or want
<pb facs="10"/> the offender could not haue the penaltie of the lawe laide vpon him, they gaue power to the magistrate to lay an extraordinarie punishment vpon him, that no offence might escape vnpunished. <hi>Generaliter placet,</hi> saith<note n="q" place="margin">L. quoties. ff. de poenis.</note> Vlpian, <hi>in legibus publicorum iudiciorum, vel priuatorum criminum, qui extra ordinem cognoscunt praefecti vel praesides, vt eis, qui poenam pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niariam egentes eludunt, coercitionem extraordinariam inducant.</hi> To spare rebels and traitors doth cause diuers incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. It discourageth loyall subiectes to aduenture in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the state; it maketh the rebels more insolent; it giueth more opportunitie to forreine enemies to practise; and finally the example of sparing some, doth embolden other euill disposed persons to attempt the like. It is an olde saying, <hi>Impunitas magna est peccandi illecebra.</hi> Finally the lawe of God doth put a sword into the magistrates hand, not for naught, but to maintaine honest men, and to punish the wicked.</p>
   <p>Now as it is not safe, nor profitable, to let rebelles and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors passe without due iustice; so it is not religious nor pious to suffer hereticall and false teachers, and spreaders of sectes and diuisions to escape vnpunished, God hath<note n="r" place="margin">

      </gap>ues; nor should they so much haue encreased the popish faction, as some where they haue done.</p>
   <p>I doubt not, but magistrates both see those inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and will remedy them. And therefore I neede not to vse many words in this behalfe. But because of late a certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous and proude Iesuite calling himselfe N.D. hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him, not onely to plead for Iesuites and priests, but also for forreine enemies, and notorious rebelles and traytors, aduancing the cause and power of the enemie, and by a strange metamorphosis of words turning traytors into true subiectes, and rebellious heretikes into martyrs, and by his painted glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses burnishing out heresie, superstition, and idolatry for true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, catholike faith &amp; Gods true worship; I haue vpon zeale I beare to Gods truth, and loue I owe to her Maiesty and my country, and not least of all, for that harty affection which I beare to all my Christian countrymen, whome these false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers apparelled in sheepes clothing with their counterfeite sheepes blayting seeke to abuse; vndertaken to answere all his pleading, &amp; to iustifie the honest and religious intention of that noble knight Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> that first aduentured to speake against them, and to shew in generall, that our enemies are no such bugs, as we neede to feare them; nor english fugitiues such innocents, as they are pretended; nor the factious papists so honest men that we are far to trust them.</p>
   <p>And because he shall not complaine, that we refuse any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different triall, I haue thought it not amisse, to vndertake his challenge, and to meete him at euery turne, and in euery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
<pb facs="11"/> following him pase by pase, and ioyning foote to foote. He would percase bring it to another triall, <hi>Vbi collato pede dimicandum est;</hi> or as <hi>Virgil</hi> saith, <hi>Vbi haeret pede pes, den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>súsque viro vir:</hi> and we refuse not, when we shall see him and his consortes come against vs in plaine field. But in the meane while we are to try our cause with words, and not with armes, and to iustifie first our accusation against Romish religion, then against the pope, the Spaniard, the Iesuites, Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> the recusantes, and all enemies, traytors, and malcontentes whatsoeuer. And forasmuch as vnder colour of religion our aduersary would slily defend all attemptes and practises against this state, I haue with my answere vnto this Noddy conioyned a breife discourse, and in certaine new encounters, drawing him foorth into a new combat, prooued that popish religion, whereon he so much standeth, as if it were catholike, and the old religion of Christs church, <hi>Is neither catholike, nor ancient, nor true religion;</hi> and finally, that neither the church of Rome is the true church of Christ, nor the popes agents and adherents, that haue beene executed for traytors, true subiectes or martyrs. Which treatise if it profit not obstinate papists, yet shall it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strengthen the hands of good subiects, and of all men well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and stay others that they be not easily carried either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to opinions sauoring of heresie, or else tending to disloyalty, and treachery.</p>
   <p>I shall not neede to tell you what manner of man this N.D. is, against whome we deale. He declareth himselfe so plainely, that I cannot more euidently prooue him either a malicious enemy, or a disloyall traytor, then he doth himselfe. For what greater signe of an enemy, then to pleade the cause of publike enemies, and to enuy that any commendation should be giuen, or any blessing happen to this state? What more plaine conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his trecherous intentions, then that he extolleth the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of traytors, and is very sory, that forreine enemies and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked rebells haue not preuailed against vs? It is an old saying,
<pb facs="12"/> that eagles loue eagles, and beares well sort with beares.</p>

   <p>There cannot be deuised any thing more malicious, then the pope and Spaniard to the English nation; neither can any speake more spitefully of his country, of this state, and of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then this rinegued English, and Hispaniolized fugitiue. And doe wee maruell, if they be friendes, and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
   <p>Onely this is much to be maruelled, that any sober minded papist should allow such a proctor to speake for him, or that this Noddy would be so presumptuous, as to present his fooleries to the councell; or so foolish, to thinke, that such notorious enemies, and traytors can grace the cause of papists, or procure them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, whom his patronage maketh much more suspect, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This we may boldly conclude, that whatsoeuer such ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies perswade or offer, that it cannot be for the good of our state. It is an old<note n="b" place="margin">Sophocles in A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ace mastig.</note> saying, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. The gifts of enemies tend not to our good. The Greekes, as is said, in time past would present Minerua of Troy with a horse; but in the bellie there lurked treason. So this Sinon N. D. if such a Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be compared to Sinon, would perswade vs to receiue the horse-religion of papistes, and horse-friendship of Spaniards. But if he should preuaile, then might we say of him, as the olde man in<note n="c" place="margin">Plautus in Pseudolo.</note> Plautus said of Pseudolus, <hi>Superauit dolum Troia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, atque vicit Pseudolus.</hi> But I hope I haue discouered all the trecherie of this <hi>Sinon,</hi> or <hi>Pseudolus,</hi> or false traitor, or whatsoeuer his malice deserueth to be called.</p>
   <p>It may be some will mislike, that I should so roughly handle our countrie papistes and their religion. But they must consider what rebellions haue beene raised, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> what practises haue beene attempted against her Maiestie, this state, and all true Christians by this faction. I doe not meddle with olde men, that are abused with ancient errours and liue quietly, but with fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb facs="12"/> papistes, and such as aide them, and receiue them, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue correspondence with forreine enemies, or receiue their agents. Now what termes can be too bitter against these, that seeke to bring in strangers, to oppresse all honest men, to ruinate their countrie, to murder their prince, and all that shall adhere to her? As for the religion of papists, whereby I vnderstand all those corruptions, which vnder the popes authoritie they haue brought into the church of God, and which the church of England refuseth, it is nothing but a packe of nouelties, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious vanities and heresies, as we both haue, and alwaies shall be readie to maintaine either against Parsons, or the cardinall Iesuite Bellarmine, or the proudest of that sect and faction. This religion of poperie therefore being not that seede, which Christ did sowe in his field the church, but the cockle, and weedes sowne, and set by the malitious man, while the gouernours of the church were asleepe, what termes could I vse more gentle, then I haue done?</p>
   <p>This I may boldly say, that I haue not followed the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries veine in scurrilous scoffing, nor his vanitie in ruffianlike bragging, nor his sharpnesse in plaine rayling. But why should I goe about to excuse my selfe before the faultes be prooued? Percase it is no fault to write, as I haue done. And were it a fault, yet I trust thou wilt beare with my weakenesse: seeing, as the<note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Iacob.</hi> 3.</note> apostle saith, <hi>All of vs offend in many things.</hi> This I speake in the presence of God, that my intention was not to wrong any, but onely to lay downe the truth plainly, that we may knowe not onely who be friends, who be traitors; but also, who they be that contend for religion and iustice, and who not. Reade with indifferencie, and weigh my allegations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare diligently my defence with the Noddies challenge, and then vse thy libertie in iudgement, and respect not me, but the cause, and the proofes.</p>
