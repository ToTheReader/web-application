   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree principall causes (Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend) haue moued me to offer this small Labour to your Graces view: First, the iust respect of my particular dutie, which challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth al parts of my labor, as a most thankefull acknowledgement of that seruice which I owe vnto you. Secondly, the forme of our Church gouernment, which imposeth a submitting of our labours, to the censure and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of those, to whom by right that charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth; wherein seeing your authoritie and care, next vnto our dread Soueraigne, is, and is to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed greatest, I desire you to vouchsafe to giue that allowance, which your Grace in your wisdome shall thinke fit. The last reason, is the person of him, who (whilest he liued) was aduanced, honoured, and esteemed by you; and now being dead, his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and sinceritie, against the false accusations of others, challengeth a defence at your Graces

hand: For doubtlesse it is more right to vertue, to defend the deceased, then to aduance those that are liuing. This as reason, euer expecteth at the hands of vertue; so especially then, when men of worth, of desert, of learning, are mistaken and accused, by those that doe want all. I craue to the rest of all your Graces fauours, that this last may be added; That whatsoeuer my imperfections are, in this iust and temperate Defence, they may no way diminish the honourable remembrance of him, whom I doe defend: all allowance is his due; the faults are mine; for which in all humilitie, I craue pardon.</p>
