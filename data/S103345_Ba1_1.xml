   <head>¶ <hi>To the right honorable</hi> Sir Richard Pipe, Knight, Lorde <hi>Maior of the Citie of London, and the</hi> right worshipful his brethren, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of health and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> of ciuil gouernment.</head>
   <p>PERICLES was woont (Right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful) as oft as he put on his robes, to preach thus vnto himselfe: Consider wel <hi>Pericles,</hi> what thou doest, thou commaundest free men, the Greekes obey thee, &amp; thou gouernest the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Athens. If you say not so much to your selues, the gownes that you weare, as the cognisances of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; and the sword which is cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before you, as the instrument of iustice; are of sufficient force to pur you in mind, that you are the masters of free men, that you gouerne the worshipfull Citizens of London, and that you are the very Stewards of her
<pb facs="38"/>
Maiestie within your liberties. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sith by mine owne experience I haue erected a Schoole of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, which I haue seene in <hi>London,</hi> I presume the more vpon your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, at the ende of my Phamphlet to present a fewe lynes to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reading.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Augustus</hi> the good Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> was neuer angry with accusers because hee thought it necessarye (where many abuses flourish) for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man freely to speake his minde. And I hope that <hi>Augustus</hi> (I meane such as are in authoritie) will beare with me, because I touch that which is needefull to bee shewen. Wherein I goe not about to instruct you howe to rule, but to warne you what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hangs ouer your heads, that you may auoyde it.</p>
   <p>The Byrde <hi>Trochilus</hi> with crashing of her bil awakes the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and deliuereth her from her enemyes, that are readye too charge her in deadesleepe. A little fishe swimmeth
<pb facs="38"/>
continnally before the great Whale, to shewe him the shelues, that he run not a ground: The Elephants, when any of their kinde are fallen into the pittes, that are made to catch them, thrust in stones and earth to recouer them: When the Lyon is caught in a trap, <hi>Aesops</hi> Mouse by nibling the cordes sets him at libertie. It shall be inough forme with <hi>Trochilus</hi> to haue wagged my bil; with the little Fish to haue gone before you; with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants to haue shewed you the way to helpe your selfe; and with <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops</hi> mouse to haue fretted the snares with a byting tooth for your owne safetie.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> when they must passe ouer frosen streames, sende out theyr Wolues, whiche laying their cares to the yse, listen for noyse: If they hear any thing, they gather that it mooues; if it mooue, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed; If it be not congealed, it must be liquide; If it be liquide, then will it yeelde; and if it yeelde, it is not
<pb facs="39"/>
good trusting it with the weight of their bodyes, leste they sincke. The worlde is so slippery, that you are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inforced to passe ouer Yse. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly beseech you to try far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; trust lesse; not your Woolues, but many of your Citizens haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read sifted the daunger of your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and in sifting beene swallowed to their discredite.</p>
   <p>I would the abuses of my Schoole were as wel knowen of you, to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: as they are fouud out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their owne peril. But the fishe <hi>Sepia</hi> can trouble the water to shun the nettes, that are shot to catch her: <hi>Torpedo</hi> hath craft inough at the first touch to inchant the hooke, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the line, to bewitch the rod, and too benumme the handes of him that angleth. Whether our Players be the Spawnes of such fishes, I know not wel, yet I am sure that how many nets soeuer ther be layde to take thē, or hookes to choke them, they haue Ynke in their bowels to darken the
<pb facs="39"/>
water; and sleights in their budgets, to dry vp the arme of euery Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. If their letters of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were once stayed, it were easie for you to ouerthrowe them. <hi>Agesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> was greatly rebuked, because in matters of iustice, he inclined to his friends and became partiall. <hi>Plutarch</hi> condemneth this kinde of writinge, <hi>Niciam, si nihil admisit noxae; exime; Si quid admisit; mihi exime; omnino autem hominem noxae exime.</hi> If <hi>Nicias</hi> haue not offended, meddle not with him: If hee be guiltie, forgiue him for my sake, What soeuer you doe, I charge you acquite him. This inforceth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates like euill Poets to break the feete of their verse, and singe out of tune, and with vnskilful Carpenters, to vse the Square and the compasse, the Rule and the Quadrant, not to builde, but to ouerthrow.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Bona verba quaeso.</hi> Some say that it is not good iesting with edge toles: The Atheniens will mince <hi>Phocion</hi> as small as fleshe to the potte, if they
<pb facs="40"/>
bemad: but kil <hi>Demades</hi> if they bee sober: And I doubte not but the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of <hi>London</hi> will vexe mee for speaking my minde, when they are out of their wittes, and banishe their Players, when they are beste aduised.</p>
   <p>In the meane time it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth your Honour in your charge, too play the Musition, streatch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery string till hee breake, but sette him in order. Hee that will haue the Lampe too burne cleere, must aswell powre in Oyle to nourish the flame, as snuffe the Weeke, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the light. If your Honour desire too see the Citie well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, you must aswell sette to your hand to thrust out abuses, as shewe your selfe willing to haue all amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And (least I seeme one of those idle Mates, which hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to buy at home, and lesse too sell in the market abrode, stand at a boothe, if it be but to gase; or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worke in mine owne study, and
<pb facs="40"/>
hauinge no wit to gouerne Cities, yet busye my braynes with your honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble office) I wil heere ende, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pardon for my faulte, because I am rashe; &amp; redresse of abuses, because they ar naught.</p>
