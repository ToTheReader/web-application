                 <title>Sixe demaunds (from an vnlearned Protestant, to a learned Papist,) : so forcible against all obstinate Papists, that not any of them are able to reply, without absurd equiuocation. Also an inuincible argument, to proue the Church of Rome to erre, with an infallible note whereby to know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error</title>

   <head>To the Protestant Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Presuppose (Christian Reader) that thou canst not be ignorant of the great number of learned bookes now extant, touching the Controuersies betweene the Papists and our selues, about the truth of Christian Religion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I stand in some doubt, that thou wilt reiect this vnlearned Pamphlet of mine, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needelesse, proceeding from so weake an Author.</p>
   <p>But mistake me not, for knowing my selfe not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write scholer-like, I haue therefore endeuoured to write Christian-like. (Euery Christian is not skilfull in Artes, neyther is euery great scholer a true Christian.) My whole intent in the penning hereof, is no more but to lay open vnto the zealous seduced Papist, that the Church of Rome doth erre; which truth being once made manifest to the aduersary, the maine pillar of popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is thereby vtterly ruinated, and peace among Christians vniuersally to be expected. But vnlesse it be first made manifest vnto him, that the visible Church may erre, sooner may the world be filled with bookes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, then we to agree all in one profession.</p>
   <p>Therefore to the effecting whereof (notwithstanding all former bookes) let euery good Christian Souldier vse his best endeuours, and euery man decently according to his vocation; remembring this by the way, that as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour doth weaken many great ones, so truth is able to strēgthen many little ones. And aboue all things, be sure that thou doost endeuour, as well to expresse Christ true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by workes, as to professe him truely by words: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the mortified Papist, notwithstanding his ignorance, may iustly alleage more against thee, then thou art able to alleage against him.</p>
   <p>Therefore, that we may be all true Christians, both in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed and word, let euery one seeke as well to reforme the one as the other, Farewell.</p>
