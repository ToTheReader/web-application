Micer Francisco Bonnet, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
of Catalunna, and
Counsellour of
Barcelona.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight reverend Sir,
being of opinion, that
the subject of this
booke, intituled the
<hi>Galateo Espanol,</hi>
is of great importance, and of much
furtherance, to know how, and in
what manner, men ought (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily)
to carry themselves, so that
they be not only not ill thought of,
and hated of others, But very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
and pleasing to all: and
considering on the other side, that
for want of Copies thereof, the
common wealth looseth this so great
a good. I determined to print it
<pb facs="6"/>
at my owne charge. Because that it
is not now in my power, or ability,
to doe things of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
I have (at least) done what
I could in this little: and as much
as my skill would reach unto. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
taking it into my considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto whom I were best to
dedicate it, as the custome is to
doe, in the like impressions of
bookes; my phansy then gave me, that
I could not better dedicate it, to any
body then your honour, who with
greater zeale and thought, desireth,
&amp; procureth, the good of this same
common wealth then any other, (as
all doe well see, &amp; confesse) as well
in the charge of a Counsellour, as in
that of a deputy, which your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
houlds, at the present, and doth
order, and governe there in with
so great diligence. Therefore I trust,
that your honour will bee pleased,
to receive it under your protection:
and although the service bee not
such, as is fit for the person of your
<pb facs="6"/>
Honour, yet receive the heart and
good will, with which it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
together with the desire I
have, to serve your Honour, and the
common wealth, (dayly) more and
more, in matters of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
for by this favour, and
reward, I recover more heart, and
vigour, to undertake, and finish
a greater worke. God keepe your
Lordship.</p>
