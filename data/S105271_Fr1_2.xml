But seeing no creature is so wise as man, nor any so foolish, my Wits haue heere beene at charges to feast either sort. A mixt Banquet of Sweete and Sowre, Fulsome, and VVholesome, <hi>Seria cum Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>

stands furnished before them. In this <hi>Horse-Race</hi> there is no cheating, my Building (as many Rich mens great houses) is not onely to keepe Rats, and Spiders in it, but euery Roome (though all be but meane) hath some picture to delight you. The Plat-forme being narrow, I could raise no lofty Stories; for when the Ditty is light, the Aire must not be Graue; A <hi>Crow</hi> is not to build so high as an <hi>Eagle</hi>: as the Face of my Inuention was drawne, such I could not chose but proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out the Body. Yet the Picture hath lost some of the Cullors I gaue it.</p>
   <p>I know you loue to Reade, because you know to Censure; Reade, this I pray as I writ it — (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,) and Censure, as I send it — (in Loue) Beare with the hard-fauourdnesse of the Title. The value of a Diamond is not lessened by the roughnesse when it is Vncut. It can bee no shame to gather a Violet, growing close to the ground. Had I better you should enioy it; such as it is if you entertaine, I shall rest.</p>
