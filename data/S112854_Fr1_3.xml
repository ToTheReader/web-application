      </gap>re be any fault (for the best want not their own blemishes) it is vpon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
<pb facs="9"/>
which is neerest to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Namely, in too great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and clemencie, which of old was noted for an infirmitie in good <hi>Theodosius, Quod ex man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudine in nimiam lenitatem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinauerït,</hi> yet euen of this will I say with <hi>Nazian. Etiam haec est dei humanitas &amp; Clementia.</hi> This also is a resemblance of the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of God, whose deputie on earth your Highnes are, for hee is gracious, slow to wrath, long suffering and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue. Many a time he bends his bowe to shoote at the wicked, the arrowes of his anger, but is <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>,<note place="margin">Pisidae <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> slowe and loath to let them go: Yea, oftimes hee shoots &amp; purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly misseth his marke, sparing yet for a time:
<pb facs="9"/>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, his warnings are many, but where they worke not, hee strikes at length, and no more but once. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: Thus euē the Lord whose mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is marueilous, meanes him to iudgement▪ where mercie is abused: It is no pietie but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition to spare, when time is to strike. And it is a cruell cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, which is declared vpon one with the destruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. The Pillars which vphold a Kingdome, are Mercie and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, since by them Kinges are conserued, Your Highnesse out of your rare wisedome, will haue a care to conserue them both, that neither Mercie make preiudice to Iustice, nor Iustice againe take away the praise of Mercie.</p>
   <p>

         </gap>desprima &amp; vita ima,</hi> are most vnseemely; so is the dignity doubled, where the preferment is beautified with pietie: and herein also hath the Lord magnified his mercie toward your Maiesty, that as by an high calling he hath exalted your Highnesse a Head &amp; Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ouer this Mightie people, so hath hee made your Highnesse no lesse eminent by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his grace, then your Maiestie is by the Honor of the place, liuing in the eyes of all men a patterne of Vertue, yea an image of the heauenly King, walking so among the euill that you are not infected with their vice, and so with the good that the best are made better by your example. God make vs
<pb facs="10"/>
wise to know what wee haue, for because the Lord hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his people, therefore hath hee set such a King ouer them, to rule them with equitie and righteousnesse. The Lord make vs thankefull for it, and long may your Highnes liue &amp; raign a happy king of many blessings to your people, <hi>Amen.</hi>
