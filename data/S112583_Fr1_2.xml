      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne cheefe fruite of reading (Madame) is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of iudgement, and therefore necessarie wee reade good things, to the ende, that with a vertuouse exercise in conuersation, our conscience may also settle, and our selues reste supplied with wholesome instructions conducible to a happie state and direction of lyfe. And albeit (with the Philosophers) all knowledge of it selfe is good (as by Histories to discerne the pollicies of times and seasons, and out of other Artes and Sciences to draw the nature of elementes, and propertie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things) yet (with S.

Peter sayth) like a Candle in a darke place: yea it bringes vs into hope,<note place="margin">2 Pet. Rom. 15. Iames 1.</note> and hath power euen to saue our soules. So that if our trauell in other Artes and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yeelde vs benefite in Ciuill and Politike respects, the studie of the Scripture implyeth a heauenly fruite, as by the which our sinnes are qualefied, our soules releeued, our faithe assured, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our whole life ledde (as it were by an Angell of purpose) to the visible societie of soueraigne felicitie. Wherein by how muche this fruite is preciouse and certayne, by so muche are wee drawen in a

   <p>Heare (Madame) if my sufficiencie were as equall to watche with the nature and maiestie of this high cause, as all Christians liue vnder a condition of necessarie duetie, to know and set foorthe the Scriptures, I could adde many authorities to my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, not to vndertake thereby to prepare your conscience, which I doubt not is infallibly settled in a perfecte Methode of Gods true Religion, and much lesse to induce your zeale, which J know is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in the best degree <hi>secundum scientiam,</hi> as the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

   <p>I coulde further enlarge in the particular effectes of your deepe discretion, as your wise behauiour amongst the French to discharge the high trust of your husbande, when God had called him from you, your deare care to conuey his dead body with honor from that forreyne place, your vnfayned duetie of a wife in his honorable Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, your honest conscience to defray his debtes, and indue such

   <p>Onely it may please your Ladyshippe to lay afore you these first fruites of my duetie and honest affection, vnder this little ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Religion, which albeit is not worthy your view by any indeuer of mine, yet waying with the qualitie of the matter, your disposition to holy things, I hope it will not proue altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plausible with you, as conteyning a familiar sense in Gods deepe mysteries, with expresse difference betweene the rude sophistrie of the Papistes, and milde simplicitie of the reformed side: Which J beseeche you so fauor with your authoritie and name, that by how muche our Christian countreymen (by your good meanes) may frutefully communicate in so necessarie a benefite, euen by so muche also they may bee drawen too glorifie God, and pray <hi>communi voce</hi> to giue you societie with that holy widdow which S.
