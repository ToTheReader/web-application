   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, and vertuous Lady, the Lady <hi>Ioan Leuenthorpe.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Madame, this Booke of priuate prayer being brought vnto mee by a Friend to peruse, and being withall requested by him to write the Preamble to the booke with three or foure Prayers for certain particular vses, I yeelded to him, and haue made
<pb facs="3"/>
choyse of your <hi>Ladiship,</hi> on whom I might bestow it, being assured of your deuout affection, and kinde acceptance of these my labours, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, I goe not about to teach you that, you know not; but rather put you in mind of what you know already, desiring nothing more then that your pious disposition might increase vnto the period of our time. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>is a Speach to God: when you read, God speakes to you: when you pray you speake with God;</hi> a seruice it is of no small commoditie.
<pb facs="3"/>
For by it wee obtaine good things, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of euilles, by it our faith is exercised and increased, our loue is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, our zeal is inflamed, Gods graces are augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his creatures sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, tentations vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and the tempter ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. To this GOD hath giuē vs his precept, and made vs a promise: Christ hath also giuen vs a patterne, and his owne ensample: his Saints hath made it their practise, and we are dayly called vnto it, and now more then heretofore the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD hauing
<pb facs="4"/>
beene within these few yeeres very strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon vs, by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and long lasting pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, by inundation of waters, extremitie of cold &amp; heat, of drought and moisture, vnusuall diseases, and outrageous windes, so as it may bee feared he hath some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther punishments yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, except by our deuout and instant pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he may be pacified. I suppose it therfore not vnmeet for euery one to stir vp himselfe, and one to excite another to this duty, so needfull &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious.
<pb facs="4"/>
Accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you of these things, as written to this end; so shall I count my labors (if any) wel rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and my selfe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The God of Grace vouchsafe you his grace, whiles you liue on earth, and make you shine in immortall glorie with him in the heauen.</p>
