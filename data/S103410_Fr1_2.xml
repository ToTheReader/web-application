                 <title>Greenes Orpharion : VVherin is discouered a musicall concorde of pleasant histories, many sweet moodes graced vvith such harmonius discords, as agreeing in a delightfull closse, they sound both pleasure and profit to the eare. Heerein also as in a diateheron, the branches o vertue, ascending and descending by degrees: are covnited [sic] in the glorious praise of women-kind. VVith diuers tragicall and comicall histories presented by Orpheus and Arion, beeing as full of profit as of pleasure. Robertus Greene, in Artibus Magister</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Nnius (Right Worshipful) had
a Maecenas, though his verses
were rude, &amp; Hippocrates durst

presumption: for sayth hee, will

(right Worshipfull) with their
humours, hauing attempted to
frame out an ORPHARION, to harsh to make a
concord in any cunning eare: yet with old Ennius doating
in my youth as he did in his age: I doe presume to present
my rurall Instrument vnder the shadow of your patronage,
and the rather for that as the poore Cobler durst prefer his

with such honourable vertues and plausible qualities, as
drawes men to admire and loue such vnited perfection: I
embolden my selfe to trust vpon your Worships curteous
acceptance, which if it be such as others haue founde and I
hoped for, &amp; that any way this Orpharion may agree with
the daintines of your touch and fingering, the end of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
