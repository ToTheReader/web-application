   <p>IT is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to your selfe, how the sons of <hi>Japhet</hi> old <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> grand-children
<pb facs="4"/> searching the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne places of the world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to get beyond that <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> where they have descried (<hi>gravissima passi</hi>) the <hi>Proteus</hi> like formes of men, and have with <hi>Oedipus</hi> expounded the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmaes of that
<pb facs="4"/> monstrous Sphinx: where some like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> valiant, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like <hi>Thirsites,</hi> base: others like <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> poore <hi>Jrus</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious: have been their obiects, thogh their travell hath beene dangerous, their pilgrimage te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with <hi>inane
<pb facs="5"/> perdimus opus atque oleum,</hi> such is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, Sir, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this sea dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering many formes, observing divers dispositions, I found one speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a language inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being his guide a runnagate from heaven, a scorner of
<pb facs="5"/> counsell, one which seems to be one, yet not one, denying to pay God his owne, disdaining that hee which gave him life should receive it: and being ingaged for those soules which suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke in this sea of miserie: I could not but send forth this
<pb facs="6"/> childe of mine to be <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to direct men to the harbour of salvation, and to defend them from the workes of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reduce this man to a safe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that my poore Infant be not with every little wave overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb facs="6"/> I offer it to be guarded by your worthy protection, that <hi>Ʋlysses</hi> like it may bee sheltred <hi>tanquam sub clypeo Aiacis</hi> from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous proiects of Scandall. And that the world might know that as your bountie hath had a hand to give, so my
<pb facs="7"/> thankfulnesse shall ever have a hand to write <hi>Received:</hi> for benefits they say, are alwaies best gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when they are most concealed, but thankes when they are most knowne: therfore I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the art of the Printer, which is the publique tongue of
<pb facs="7"/> the learned, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse my selfe most gratefull unto you, I would be sorry to make knowne my owne foule folly in your faire praises; I know you would checke me for it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then cherish mee in it: yet give me leave to tell you that all true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="8"/> in this life, and eternall in the next, is wished unto you</p>
