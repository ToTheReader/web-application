      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Noble Gentleman, liking the plaine writing of a Soldier, (in whose profession an Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable minde hath made him add experience to his affection) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the eloquence and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate work of a professed Scholler, (affecting <hi>Caesars</hi> matter not his words) especially, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōgst our late writers delighting in two plain discourses of the famous Knight Sir <hi>Robert Williams;</hi> And finding iust fault that our <hi>English</hi> are to idle in memorizing their owne exploit. Entreated, nay, cōmanded me (for such is his power) since he could draw no better pencill to so good a picture, to put my selfe in print, (though to the censure of euery busie body) wherein, in obseruance to his will, I spent some time in discoursing vpon the <hi>Spanish</hi> forme of Discipline, by such exploits of our Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spaniard, as I my selfe had seene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But, by misfortune, already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Epistle, my labour miscaried. And not hauing meanes to begin againe at this time, as willingly I would for his satisfaction, I was by him enduced to treat of another Subiect,
<pb facs="4"/>
being yet matter of the same profession, and some part acted within the compasse of mine owne experience; wherein, because the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine might better sh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>w the streame, I could not chuse but ascend to a time foregoing mine, as well to begin where the former Historian of that Countries Gouernment left; as because, that from that time, the later and succeeding troubles had their likely beginning; purposing to haue proceeded thence, to the end of the last Warres of <hi>Ireland:</hi> In most part of which, I had spent many of my endeuours, thether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where from a childe, I had receiued breeding, then liuing in those Warres, when this worthy Gouernour Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> ruled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, if such had beeue Gods pleasure, we may guesse, it had beene happy that he had gouerned much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as well for the good of that Kingdome: as for the honour and contentment of our late most famous and euer renowned Queene, to whom the ensuing troubles (through the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gouernment of his Successours, brought dishonour and griefe. First, by the losse of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy men (the flower of our Nation) with an infinite number of guiltlesse soules torne out of this world by misery and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in those Warres, the expence of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous masse of Treasure, with other prouision, enough to haue shaken the Walls of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Monarchy in <hi>Europe,</hi> if all these had beene
<pb facs="4"/>
so imployed, which was not vnlikely, if Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> had beene returned into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as vpon the beginning of the Warres the Queene determined. Then by being so long resisted by such base Rebels concluding her Raigne, (that had flourished with so many famous Acts against the capitall Enemie of her, and her neighbours, by which they at this day, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of misery, flourish againe in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) with a strong Warre against so petty Traytours: Whereon, since time will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the passage it selfe, I shall neede to insist no longer: This purpose of the Queenes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> was preuented by the two sinnes of <hi>Couetousnesse</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the then Gouernour there, and a person here transcendent both in power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the one, to maintaine his profit (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto some powerfull friend of his had too much relation:) the other not brooking Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> high, and (indeede) too chollerick spirit and condition, being fearefull of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, ioyned with the other. So groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a combination, builded vp by the helpe of two other instruments of that State, the one in his owne Nature euill, the other contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his particular ends. Thus an Enemie Armed, it was no difficult thing, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Traytor should bee encouraged in hope of pardon, and some other mercenarie persons to accuse an Innocent.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
To this forged accusation, That great and iust Prince (incensed to displeasure by such an one as was neere in fauour, who pretended her safety, as the colour of his intended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and that displeasure exasperated by some part of the accusation, which to her was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall) was vrged to giue way, euen against her heart to his prosecution, as appeared by her answer to the newes of his condemnation: for she casting into the ballance of her iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his former weighty Seruices, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous endeuours, and weighing them with those base persons his Accusers, and their light proofes produced against him, said thus in the hearing of men of good account, and some neere to me in bloud and acquaintance. Is he found guilty? Then, in my conscience, they haue found an Innocent guilty.</p>
   <p>And had she restored his Estate to his issue, as shee respited his. Execution, being hardly drawne to giue way to his sentence. The fault had wholly layne vpon the false accusations, and sentence, thereupon procured, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Prosecutors, and Periurie of his Accusers: But so long a Reigne as hers, hath seldome escaped being spotted with greater blots, then this omission, which, if God had spared her a little longer life, she had (as I haue beene credibly tolde) repaired by a Reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his Estate, to such as he had dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it in his life time.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
Thus much I am moued the more to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by writing his Gouernement, which gaue me occasion to looke further then others haue done into the course and cause of his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
   <p>As I was proceeding in my intended dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I gayned notice, that this Story suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> time, was already vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pen of a more able hand, one that had taken much paines in that Subiect, (onely hauing omittted Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> time for some particular reasons) which must needes ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish my worke, because not so substantiall. I abruptly therefore brake off, with such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse as to him belonged, who was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of my vndertaking. And if this, thus much, come in Print, I pray you know it, to be his will onely. But if this weake labour be not misliked, I will proceede further, as time shall spare me leasure.</p>
