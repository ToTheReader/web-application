         <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.</note> he saued me from the mouth of the King of Lyons, and according to the multitude of his mercies, hee deliuered mee from the teeth of them that were ready to deuoure me, and out of the hands of them that sought after my life;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Vers.</hi> 7.</note> yea, he was so gracious vnto me, that he left me not vntil mine eyes did see their desire vpon mine enemies, not their destructiō, which my soule desired they
<pb facs="10"/> might neuer taste of, and I pray God they desired the same themselues, but their suppression, so as they might neuer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the miseries of Gods seruants, nor trample the bloud of innocents vnder feet: And therefore seeing God hath been so gracious vnto me, I haue most constantly resolued by the assistance of his Spirit, not onely to praise his Name for his goodnesse and to tell what he hath done for my soule, but also to dedicate my whole life wholly to his seruice, to despise the vanities of this life, to abandon all the pleasures of this world, to be carelesse of all earthly things,<note n="*" place="margin">Quae possessa onerant, amata inquinant, &amp; amissa cruciant.</note> but what may make <hi>in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad deum,</hi> to helpe me the better to serue my God, and with <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to consume my life in the preaching and penning of Gods Word, and maugre all the malice of the proudest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the world, to speake the truth, as my conscience tels me, though my wife and children should all begge, and my body be burned for the same: I will neuer count my life deare vnto me, to spend it in his seruice that so often gaue it me: And because I desired to doe that which I thought best for the edifying of Gods Church, I haue applied my selfe to treate of these ensuing theames, which doe containe the chiefest points and the most necessary grounds of all Christian Religion: for, besides my naturall inclination, euer tending rather to pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then contention, I thinke we haue more neede of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall instructions, which are necessary for all men, then of any controuersiall positions, which may satisfie some men, that perhaps desire rather to informe their iudgement, then to reforme their manners: And in the handling of them I haue intermingled the positiue declaration of the truth, in a schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke forme, with a forcible application of the same vnto our soules, for the framing of our liues, to make vse of what wee learne: for I approue not so well the handling of Gods word with too slender inforcement of the same vnto our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the schoolemen did, &amp; their too much addicted follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vse to doe; nor yet meerely to stand vpon exhortations with too slight expounding the most principle grounds of Religion, which I feare to be the fault of too many amongst vs: And therefore the one being but as a foundation without roofe, and the other as a building on the sand, or in the ayre vpon reeden
<pb facs="10"/> pillars, I haue euer adiudged it the best course to knit both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make both a perfect buiding. If I haue done well, it is that which I desired, but if I haue done slenderly, it is that I could attaine vnto;<note place="margin">Aug. proaem. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Trinit.</note> And therefore I will be euer of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers minde, which in all his workes and writings, desired not onely <hi>pium Lectorem,</hi> a courteous Reader of his labours, but also <hi>liberum Correctorem,</hi> a free reprouer of his faults; but so that they doe it friendly, to blame in their iudgement where it is equity, but not to blaze my faults vnto the world, which is a breach of charity; and that they doe as well accept of what is good, as except against what is ill herein; for I know there be many, <hi>Momus-like, Qui vel non intelligendo reprehendunt,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Idem. contra Faust. l. <hi>22.</hi> c. <hi>34.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>vel reprehendendo non intelligunt;</hi> that doe shew their folly in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing others, when out of enuy or ignorance they blame that good of others which they haue not, or know not themselues: And for these there is none other helpe, but to be carelesse of their censures, and to pray against their wickednesse. There be faults escaped in the Printing, the most of them be literall, as the mistaking of <hi>e</hi> for <hi>ae, &amp; econtra,</hi> and such like faults of no great moment, especially to him that knowes how hard it is to make things perfect; and therefore I hope they shall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mended with thy pen, or pardoned without thy censure: for other things I onely desire thy prayers for mee, and thou shalt euer finde his paines and prayers for thee, which loueth thee and all men in Iesus Christ, with all vnfainednesse.</p>
