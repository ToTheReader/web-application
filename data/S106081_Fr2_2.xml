            <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was, faire, vertuous, wittie, for your sake,</l>
         <l>That I this harder taske did vndertake.</l>
         <l>I grieu'd, such wit was out of your cōmand,</l>
         <l>Lock'd in a tongue you did not vnderstand.</l>
         <l>To doe you seruice, not my selfe to please,</l>
         <l>Did I at first aduenture vpon these.</l>

   <p>I thought to haue proceeded in this method, but the ragged, bashfull slut my <hi>Muse</hi> (hauing not seene your like before) is amazed, and struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dumbe at the sight of your excellencies: I must therefore take vp the speech for her, and as <hi>She</hi> hath heretofore twatled much for me, I must therefore entreat you in <hi>Her</hi> behalfe. Indeed I told <hi>Her, She</hi> should finde you very louing and kinde, and should be admitted to kisse your whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test hands. <hi>She</hi> is a stranger, I humbly therefore pray you, to take her into your protection, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take her into your hands, and entertaine her courteously; none can doe it better then your selues; whilst you looke kindly vpon her, let her with admiration, and contentment gaze on your beauties: you may looke vpon her boldly with vnuailed countenances, you shall finde her euery where modest, either she hath vailde, or quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted what <hi>She</hi> feares might offend your chast
<pb facs="39"/>
eares, <hi>She</hi> hath taken paines to let you know what enuious mē haue too long kept from your knowledge. If <hi>She</hi> speake any thing against your sexe, it is but what malicious men sometimes mutter in an vnknowne language against your inferior frailties, and hath answered somewhat in your behalfe: you shall finde <hi>Her</hi> no importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Companion, for you may begin with her when you please, and leaue her when you list: euery small parcell is an entire treatise, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon it selfe; they may serue you for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, if you please, for vse, for embellishing in your discourse, as spangles in your attire: The translations were the better, if they are not made worse in the change. For our owne, they are the best we can at this time. The grace and loue I receiued sometime from one of your sexe, makes me confident of your gracious goodnesse: but my <hi>Muse</hi> hath a little recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her spirits, and requests me <hi>She</hi> may speake a little vnto you.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Your beauties, wonder and amazement bred</l>
      <l>In me, that still I am astonished:</l>
      <l>Yet this request I pray doe not deny,</l>
      <l>Giue me good words, for you haue more then I.</l>
      <l>In recompence one day Ile sing a song</l>
      <l>Of your rich worth with my laste buskins on.</l>
