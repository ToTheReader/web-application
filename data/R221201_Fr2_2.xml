   <head>The <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren, for as much as in times of war, as well as of peace, men of our calling should be ready <hi>Ad omne quare,</hi> for the service of their King and Countrey: We and our Countrey have been long happy in a blessed peace; and yet even now having rumors of warre, it is not amisse to be prepared for the contrary: Wherefore from the wise heathen Philosopher, let us all learn as followeth <hi>(Jam tua res agitur, para cum proximus ardet:)</hi> Our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations are and have been long in combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is therefore wisedome for us to be ready, and the rather we ought to take it into our better consideration, because at the first composing and writing hereof, namely in Iuly, 1626. when as I published it, there were then, and now are rumours of Warres, and our Company of Barber Surgeons were then commanded by His Majesties Authoritie forthwith to provide sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the best Surgeons as the then time afforded for his especial service by Land, such as were men most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the healing of wounds made with Gunne-shot; and generally for the most part, by reason of that long and happy peace that our Nation had enioyed, many good Surgeons being put to it at the first, were likely to have been found somewhat to seek therein; how much more then our younger men? wherefore the charge of providing, preparing, and fitting His Maiesties whole service by land and sea, being by his Highness referred to our Corporation &amp; our Company, having for that time made choice of my selfe, and deputed me to the worke, I held my selfe in conscience and dutie tied to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
<pb facs="150"/>
although I confes it was little, to the better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and encouraging of younger men unto their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that point. But here under favour I must desire pardon for a little digression; namely, that before my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance unto any further discourse, I acquaint the yonger sort of Surgeons my Brethren with those especial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which it then pleased our most gracious King Charles, to bestow upon our Corporation in particular above and beyond his ever blessed Ancestors, for the good of his Souldiers and Sea-men, and our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereby, to animate and inable us the more heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to serve him: And namely.</p>
   <p>First his Highness was graciously pleased, when also he increased the sea-mens wages, to augment the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wages of each Surgeon and Surgeons Mate in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by sea and land, to above a third penny from former custom; namely from nineteen shillings four pence a moneth to thirty shillings. He hath also bin graciously pleased to give a free benevolence to the Surgeons in all his sea services, which never was given them by any of the former Kings nor Queens of this land before as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz.</hi> To all Surgions that serve in his Highness own ships, I mean towards the furnishing of their Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Chests with Physical drugs and medicaments, I say for each of them ten pounds; and to each Merchants ship five pounds, and to each Newcastle-ship or Colliarsship serving in his Highness his affairs three pounds. And, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless all the Surgions in his Highness service have as formerly by the head of all men that are in pay in any of his ships or land-service two pence of each man by the moneth: And for the surgeons in his Land service, he alloweth to the Surgeon Major of the whole Camp five shillings a day; and for his two Mates or servants four shillings a day. Also his Majestie alloweth to each Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion two shillings and six pence the day, which is three pounds and fifteen shillings the moneth, and to each Mate three pound a moneth, and more over allowed, and gave to each Surgeon appointed to 250. men, a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
<pb facs="150"/>
Chest of 17. pounds valew free of account: And moreover his Majestie alloweth to the Surgeon Major a store Chest or Magazeen Chest of 48. pounds value, for a supply to furnish upon all wants and occasions: And His Highness was yet further well pleased to give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto the Masters and Governors of our Society, for to have the making, compounding, fitting, and ordering of all the medicines, as well Physicall as Chirurgicall, together with all other provisions belonging to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons chest. And further His Highness hath referred to the ancient Masters and the Governours of our Society, the pressing of all Surgeons and Surgeons Mates or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Surgeons and Barbers; with also the taking up of any instruments, chests, or ready made medicines in His Highness name for his service, if occasion be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. These favours and priviledges our Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have received from His Highness, together with a new Charter, wherein he hath likewise gratiously been pleased to confirm all our priviledges formerly granted unto us; and hath given us divers new priviledges for the better subsistance of our said Corporation in future times; as also we had never been denied as formerly, to have monies imprested before hand, for the providing a chest with surgery Instruments and salves. In regard whereof, and for that Surgeons should with the better courage be instigated faithfully to perform their duties; I have presumed in this Preface to explain His Highness former favors, as aforesaid, whereby our younger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren may from age to age the better keep it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and to that end I have also further under favor I hope without offence, presumed to set down the effect of the order of the then Lords of his Highness most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privie Councell, with the day and yeare in which some of the recited priviledges were granted and ordered, as also in part the form and order how his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Officers of his Navie have interpreted, dispensed, and disposed of his Maiesties said free gift, according to the severall burthens, rankes and orders of the ships of His Highness his Navy respectively, which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
