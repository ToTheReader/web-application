   <p>I Cannot deny, but my delight in the study of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories and antiquities, hath beene somewhat greater, then was needfull for a man that had dedicated himselfe and his labours vnto the seruice of Gods church in the Ministery. Which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the woorst might be said of me) I endeuoured long since in some sort to reforme the same by restrayning my selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of such antiquities, as seemed to concerne but seasticall causes or persons. My collections the one way (I meane concerning matters ecclesiasticall) can adde nothing vnto that large and painefull worke of Master <hi>Foxe.</hi> In the other kinde (concerning ecclesiasticall persons) what many yeeres reading &amp; obseruation could yeeld vnto me, some seuen or eight yeeres since I comprised in a volume; which (being perswaded therunto by diuers my friends no lesse godly then wise) I haue at last condiscended (after some conuenient aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the same) to publish. The principall reason that mooued me thereunto, is in effect but that, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith euery historiographer should propose vnto himselfe, <hi>Ne virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessileātur, vt{que} prauis dictis factis{que} ex posteritate &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famia metus sit.</hi> In the latter of these (the faults of those men of whom I am to write) I need not greatly to paine my selfe. For it is not to be denied, that the most part of the Chroniclers &amp; historiographers of our age, haue borne a hand hard ynough at least vpon the Prelates and Cleargy of former times, euery where like <hi>Chams,</hi> discouering the nakednes of these fathers, but seldome or neuer indeuouring with <hi>Sem</hi> to hide the same, much lesse affoording vnto them any honorable mention neuer so well deserued. This kinde of dealing though happily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to good purposes, might not expect that successe and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="4"/>
at Gods hand, that the plame and sincere truth is wont to finde. As <hi>Marcellus</hi> Bishop of Ancyra (<hi>Socrates</hi> reports it) labouring a little too earnestly against one <hi>Asterius</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and so derogating impiously from the person and dignity of our Sauiour Christ, byforcing some reasons of <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus</hi> (that swaruing as farre on the other side dispoyled the same our Sauiour of his humanity) he fell at last himselfe and drew many others into those pernicious &amp; impious errors of the <hi>Samosatenians:</hi>
      <q>Stulti dum vitant vitia in contraria currunt)</q> Euen so, these men inioyning somewhat too furiously the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and errors which the Cleargy of former times (much deale of ignorance) did teach and defend; whilest that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to discredit their doctrine, they depraued their persons; it hath pleased God, that this vncharitable course should sort to some other effect then was intended, and that such, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his great mercy, was like to haue caused an inconuenience of little lesse importance (I will not say greater) then that which our late reformation hath redressed. For in the vulgar sort (which distinguish not so easily betweene persons and things) it bred a conceit, not onely that the men were wicked, and so their doctrine corrupt (although I know the consequēce to be weake) but also their functions and callings to be vtterly vnlawful &amp; Antichristian, which opinion once receiued in the minds of the multitude, gaue occasion of diuers plots, coloured with the plausible shew of reformation, but indeed principally ayming at the goods and reuenues of the church, the temporall rewards of learning; which being once taken away, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is like to follow, we may easily see by the effects it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foorth elsewhere. Those countries that heretofore haue yeelded great plenty of able-worke-folkes for the Lords vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; now that brood is spent which attayned learning, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yet standing whole; they hardly can shew a man able to set pen to paper in defense of the truth. Yea euen amongst vs,
<pb facs="4"/>
although the godly and excellent care of her Maiestie hath preseraed the state of this our church in such sort, as I thinke no other reformed Church of Christendome any thing neere comparable vnto it; yet the example of other, the knowen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of so many sacrilegious cormorāts as await daily the destruction of the same, and the doubt least it will decay, for that we cannot hope for the like piety in all succeeding Princes; it so far foorth discourageth men from the study of diuinity, as the best wits dayly refuse the Vniuersities (or Diuinity at the least, which in some other countries is accounted the surest way to aduauncement) and rather betake themselues to any other kind of life. Hereof it commeth to passe, that euery age bringeth forth lesse plenty of learned men then other amongst vs: And it is much to befeared, least our posterity will too truely say,
<q>
         <l>AEtas parentum peior Auis tulit</l>
         <l>Nos rudiores, mox daturos</l>
         <l>Progeniem ineruditiosam.</l>
      </q>
To make no mention of such other reasons as might induce me to the publishing of these noses, least I make my porch larger then some principall roomes of my intended building; I thinke it necessary now to admonish the Reader, that he expect not any ample discourse of the liues and actions of the Bishops of our owne time or neere vnto it. I hane purposly auoyded to set downe any thing of them, but what either I finde written by other, or elseremayneth to be secne in publike record. And this course I haue taken, because I iudge it neither seemely to praise, nor safe to reprehend (how iustly soeuer) those men, that either by themselues, their neere friends or posterity yet liuing, may seeme either to haue allured me to flatter, or feared me from disclosing that truth, which otherwise I would haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Neither do I thinke it needefull to say much of them, who being either present in action, or fresh in memory, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowen vnto vs. Whereas moreouer, I haue passed ouer in silence some two Sees; you shal vnder stand, that I haue
<pb facs="5"/>
beene forced there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> for want of some necessary instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, by reason of the far distance of my place of dwelling from them, I haue not had meanes to attayne, although I haue endeuoured the same. I would therefore earnestly pray all men that can, to yeeld me helpe for the supplying of whatsoeuer may seeme to be wanting, either in those Sees or any other. I shall take it very thankfully at their hands. In the meane time, this which now I am able to affoord vnto you, I wish it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in good part; and God grant it may in some measure prooue a meanes of the aduauncement of his glory, and the good of his Church.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
