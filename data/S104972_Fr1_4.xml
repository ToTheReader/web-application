   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, to make a large Narration of
nothing, were scarce woorth any
thing; Yet, since it hath pleased the
great giuer of all things, to infuse life
into poore <hi>Animals</hi> (as well as Spirit
into more worthy Creatures) I haue
by the importunitie of some friends
(vpon honest conditions) let slip this
prisoner, who like a poore <hi>Peregrinator</hi> (to purchase enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is contented to passe through the Purgatorie of the
Printing-house: Where (if by his good behauiour, he doe
not merit Redemptiō) let him be prest without pity a Gods
name, and like a vituperous offender, be Stamped and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at, by the seuerest Corrector, and truest Compositor.
To be briefe, what was done, was so done, as being by the
Approbation of many, said to bee well done, then I doubt
not, but it may merit the mercifull Construction of some
few, who may chance to Sweare t'was most excellently ill
done. Zeale procured it; Loue deuis'd it; Boyes perform'd
it; Men beheld it, and none but fooles dispraised it. As for
the further Discription of the businesse, I referre to further
relation; onely thus: The chiefest part of this people-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
spectacle, consisted in three Bees, <hi>viz. Boyes, Beasts,</hi> and
<hi>Bels, Bels</hi> of a strange amplitude and extraordinarie propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>Beasts</hi> of an excellent shape, and most admirable swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and <hi>Boyes</hi> of rare Spirit, and exquisite performance.
Which glorious Triumph, with much more, was meerely
intended (as it was then thought) for the ioyfull celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Cambers</hi> boundlesse glory.</p>
