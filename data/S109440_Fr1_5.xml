And ibidem pag. <hi>105.</hi> the casting out of the diuell at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> is made the same with Christes miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous worke, and aboue some other miraculous actions.

      <item>
         <hi>3</hi> In his doctrine pag. <hi>39.</hi> no eiection of Satan in the papacie: yet pag. <hi>70.</hi> a true deliuerance in the papacie graunted, and that by their humiliation.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>4</hi> In pag. <hi>39.</hi> he auoucheth a voluntarie departure of diuels: but pag. <hi>77.</hi> the diuell (he saith) must be inticed out.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>5</hi> In his doctrine pag. <hi>12.41.81.</hi> he saith the Demoniakes receiue no hurt at all by anie their torments, and pag. <hi>13.</hi> he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth a reason why: but pag. <hi>36.</hi> hee saith <hi>Darling</hi> was so sore hurt, as for thirteene weekes after he was lame, and had no vse of his legges.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>6</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>40.</hi> hee saith that diuels are now cast forth by Christ his owne absolute authoritie, and pag. <hi>41.</hi> by his absolute &amp; supreame authoritie: but in pag. <hi>55.</hi> he saith that this supernaturall disease is cured by the supernaturall medicine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereto, as a natural medicine is applied to a natural disease.</item>
      <item>
         <pb facs="12"/>
         <hi>7</hi> In his doctrine pag. <hi>41.</hi> hee maketh fasting and prayer a warranted ordinance for the expelling of diuels by the wordes of Christ, in <hi>Matth. 17.21.</hi> and in <hi>Mar. 9.29.</hi> but in his detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pag. <hi>41.</hi> wee read not (saith he) of the first ordayning of anie such meanes.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>8</hi> In examining the words of <hi>Math. 17.21.</hi> and <hi>Mar. 9.29.</hi> he saith the same words were spoken to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> as appeareth in his doctrine, pag. <hi>41.42.50.</hi> but pag. <hi>43.44.45.46.47.48.49.</hi> he flatlie opposeth himselfe to that exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and inuents many reasons why that speech of Christ should not be appropriated to them of that age: but all this in his detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pag. <hi>43.</hi> hee doth plainely confute in this sort. Christ speakes not (saith he) of the <hi>future</hi> but of the <hi>present</hi> time, saying thus: this kind (<hi>goeth</hi>) not out, but this kind (<hi>shall</hi>) goe out, &amp;c.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>9</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>42.</hi> hee maketh sole prayer the onely meanes that euer was or shal be for casting out <hi>diuels:</hi> but pag. <hi>43</hi> he makes fasting the more effectuall <hi>meanes,</hi> and in pag. <hi>79.</hi> the more soueraigne <hi>meanes.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>10</hi> In his doctrine, pag, <hi>43,</hi> he saith, that by prayer alone, and betimes in the day, euen straight after dinner, and without any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting at all, were sundrie <hi>Diuels</hi> cast out from <hi>K. Wright:</hi> but in his detection, pag. <hi>46.</hi> he makes it a difficult matter to driue out a <hi>diuell</hi> by prayer alone, or by prayer and fasting together.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>11</hi> In laying downe the scope of the text, <hi>Matth. 17.21.</hi> hee noteth two impediments why the <hi>Apostles</hi> could not driue forth the <hi>diuell</hi>; namelie their incredulitie, and the nature of the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> but pag. <hi>46.</hi> he saith that the <hi>Apostles</hi> then (by vertue of their <hi>miraculous faith</hi>) could doe any thing, and therefore cast out a <hi>diuell</hi> of any kind whatsoeuer, which he further confirmeth, pag. <hi>47.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>12</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>47.</hi> hee saith that the <hi>Disciples</hi> by vertue of their so large a <hi>Commission,</hi> could cast out a <hi>diuell</hi> of anie kinde: but pag. <hi>50.</hi> in the second part of that his <hi>diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> hee saith that the childe was possest with one of the worst kind of <hi>spirits,</hi> and that thence it came that the <hi>Disciples</hi> could not cast them out.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>13</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>54.</hi> hee saith, that prayer and fasting being vsed aright, will certainely prosper, eyther to the remouing or sanctifying of the <hi>iudgement:</hi> but pag. <hi>59.</hi> hee saith there is no assurance to preuaile.</item>
      <item>
         <pb facs="13"/>
         <hi>14</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>52.</hi> he maketh <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer the sole <hi>meanes</hi> of conception, and procreation of children: but pag. <hi>60.</hi> another <hi>meanes</hi> is found, and the same also appointed of God for that purpose, or els the conception by sole prayer alone, would proue a <hi>miracle.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>15</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>60.</hi> and <hi>73.</hi> hee saith that <hi>miracles</hi> are vndoubtedlie ceased: but pag. <hi>63.</hi> he saith there is no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>miracles</hi> in the word.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>16</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>59.</hi> he saith it is plaine, that <hi>prayer,</hi> or <hi>prayer</hi> with <hi>fasting</hi> may be an ordinarie <hi>meanes</hi> appointed of <hi>God</hi> to driue out <hi>diuels,</hi> and yet (being vsed) not prosper to that selfe same end: but page the same, he saith that if any should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> are not of that efficacie, to cure any Demoniake without exception, it were an impious affirmation.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>17</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>69.</hi> hee saith. In as much as our Church hath this power to cast out a <hi>diuel,</hi> it conuinceth the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> touching the power they onlie bragge of for casting out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels: but pag. <hi>74.</hi> he saith, the papists haue no more cause to brag of that power, then the <hi>Rogue</hi> hath to boast of the hole in his eare.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>18</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>63.</hi> he saith, there is no determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>miracles</hi> in the word: but pag. <hi>74.75.</hi> that it is now the sole and vndoubted badge of Antichrist to worke <hi>miracles.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>19</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>74.75.</hi> he saith that the <hi>Papists</hi> may worke true <hi>miracles:</hi> but pag. <hi>76.</hi> he saith that <hi>spirits</hi> are neuer cast forth by <hi>papists,</hi> but of themselues goe willinglie out: which if it be so, then there is no miracle wrought.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>20</hi> In his doctrine, (in manie places) he saith that <hi>God</hi> hath left but one <hi>ordinarie meanes</hi> for expelling <hi>diuels,</hi> which is <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting:</hi> but pag. <hi>79.</hi> he makes two distinct <hi>meanes</hi>; the first is the supernaturall medecine of <hi>prayer</hi> alone: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he calles another of the same kind, but yet more soueraigne, namely <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prayer.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>21</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>11.</hi> and in his Detection, pag. <hi>100.</hi> and pag. <hi>107.</hi> he labours to proue that the parties in deed, were truely <hi>possest,</hi> and <hi>dispossest,</hi> and that vndoubtedly <hi>Satan</hi> did vex them. But in his Doctrine page <hi>81</hi>: he saith, that <hi>Satan</hi> is so cunning, as he can cause things to be in appearance, which are not at all.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>22</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>5.16.25.</hi> and <hi>29.</hi> he saith, that <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions</hi> are onely to be iudged by the Scriptures, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="13"/>
there is a direction left by the Lord, for the discerning of them. But in his Detection, pag. <hi>34.</hi> he saith that <hi>Christ</hi> did not ordaine any such meanes, for then we should haue it in the Scriptures; and such an <hi>ordinance</hi> there, I dare be hold to say we haue none.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>23</hi> In his Detection, pag. <hi>163.</hi> he saith, fier hath power to burne: but in the same pag. that fier hath no power to burne.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>24</hi> In his Doctrine pag. <hi>2.</hi> he saith, that it suteth altogether with <hi>Satans</hi> nature, to be filthy and wicked in speech: but in his Detection pag. <hi>175.</hi> he saith, that it suteth as well with his nature, to vse good and holy speeches.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>25</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>89.</hi> he saith, that the <hi>Lord</hi> (in these daies) doth send <hi>Diuels</hi> into men for these speciall endes, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, first,<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>16.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </note> to confound <hi>Atheists:</hi> secondly to reforme some. But (in the same page) he alleageth such a Scripture as sheweth euidently that no such thing can be possiblie effected: which causeth him to say, there is little hope, that any of the aforesaid ends should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be effected. Yet (opposing himselfe to the word) he vseth many ydle speeches about that matter, and brabbles much for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of those ends thereby.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>26</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>37.</hi> he saith, the <hi>Spirits</hi> were seene and felt of the parties in some visible <hi>formes</hi> or <hi>shapes.</hi> But pag. <hi>9.9.</hi> he saith, they could not possibly be seene, or felt, being inuisible creatures: onely they were beheld in their operations and effectes.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>27</hi> In his Doctrine (in many places) he makes it a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary work which was done vpon those his pretended <hi>Demoniakes.</hi> But pag. <hi>102.</hi> he saith it was such a worke, as neither any part of truth needeth nor yet man, in regard of his weakenesse: but in the words following, he would pinne many necessary vses vpon it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confirmation of the strong, perswasion of the weake, &amp;c.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>28</hi> In his Detection, pag. <hi>102.</hi> he doubts not, but <hi>Sommers</hi> may be recouered. But in his <hi>Narration</hi> of the <hi>Lancashire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniakes,</hi> pag. <hi>13.</hi> he giues a definitiue sentence, that he, and two others, shall neuer be cured, quoting for proofe, Luke <hi>11.26.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>29</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>60.</hi> he saith. It is no <hi>miracle</hi> that is done by <hi>meanes.</hi> But pag. <hi>63.</hi> he saith, that God can, and often doth bring most mightie thinges to passe, by small, and weake <hi>meanes.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>30</hi> In in his doctrine, pag. <hi>10.</hi> The Demoniakes in their fits, are depriued of all their <hi>senses externall</hi> and <hi>internall:</hi> but pag. <hi>11.</hi> they seeme onlie to be so, and therefore are sayde to be so.</item>
      <item>
         <pb facs="14"/>
         <hi>31</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>47.</hi> hee saith that the <hi>Apostles</hi> faith failed not: but pag. <hi>48.</hi> hee saith their faith fayled at this time when <hi>Christ</hi> spake to them, and in this very worke.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>32</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>38.</hi> he saith that these words (<hi>going out</hi> and <hi>entring in</hi>) are neuer vsed in the spirituall sense: but (in the same place) hee saith they are often and vsuallie taken in the literall sense: howbeit in his Detection, pag. <hi>58.</hi> hee saith those words are onely but <hi>Metaphors.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>33</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>50.</hi> he saith that the <hi>Disciples</hi> could not driue forth the <hi>diuell</hi> from the child by that their <hi>miraculous faith</hi>: but pag. <hi>47.</hi> and in his Detection, pag. <hi>24.</hi> he saith they could, and that one eiected so is much more admirable, then that which is done by prayer.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>34</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>59.</hi> hee saith, that neyther the whole Church, nor any member thereof (in vsing the meanes) can haue assurance to preuaile: but (in the same page) hee saith, the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is or may be great in such a case.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>35</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>66.</hi> hee maketh fasting and prayer the onelie ordinarie meanes to cast out <hi>diuels</hi>: but (in the same page) he saith, that Satan was so cast out of <hi>Darling</hi> and the rest, as Christ himselfe did cast him out, namelie by the finger of <hi>God:</hi> which manner of working he aduiseth to distinguish from all other manner of casting out <hi>diuels,</hi> as appeareth pa. <hi>55.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>36</hi> In his detection, pag. <hi>49.</hi> he saith, that faith temporarie, and historicall, are of sufficient force to cast out <hi>diuels</hi>: but in his doctrine, pag. <hi>93.</hi> where he expresseth what he meanes by fasting, he requireth such fruits of faith to be ioyned with <hi>fasting,</hi> as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possiblie proceed from these his two former kinds of faith.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>37</hi> In his doctrine (euerie where) hee saith that <hi>prayer</hi> is the Churches ordinarie <hi>meanes</hi> to driue out <hi>diuels</hi>: but in his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, pag. <hi>6.</hi> he saith, to intreat <hi>Christ</hi> to cast out a <hi>diuell</hi> is <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <hi>38</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>45.</hi> hee saith that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> they needed not to haue prayed before their working of <hi>miracles,</hi> their faith being strong: but pag. <hi>45.</hi> hee saith they did so pray, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to encrease their faith or to some other good end.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>39</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>46.</hi> he concludes directlie against his owne <hi>Analysing</hi> and expounding of that scripture, which was put downe, pag. <hi>42.</hi> Also he sets <hi>Matth. 17 21.</hi> and <hi>Luk. 9.1.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fast by the eares.

         <hi>40</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>30.</hi> he calles all men to the <hi>Law</hi> and to the <hi>testimonie.</hi> But pag. <hi>54.</hi> and in his Detection, pag. <hi>42.</hi> he standes for the defence of secret, and vnreuealed <hi>ordinances.</hi>

And in his Detection, pag. <hi>23.</hi> and <hi>25.</hi> he saith, that before <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Cyprian,</hi> and those Fathers times, the working of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> was vndoubtedly ceased.</item>

         <hi>43</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>42.</hi> he calleth <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> a secret <hi>ordinance.</hi> But pag. <hi>44.</hi> he makes it an expresse <hi>ordinance</hi> and a <hi>meanes</hi> expreslie and by name spoken of by Christ.</item>

         <hi>44</hi> In his Doctrine, pag. <hi>42.</hi> he putteth downe two impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments why the <hi>Apostle</hi> could not cast forth the <hi>Diuell</hi> from the <hi>Child.</hi> But pag. <hi>44.</hi> he saith, that, that text can no further be vnderstood of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> then onely to signifie vnto them, the nature of that <hi>spirit</hi>: whence partlie it came to passe, that they could not cast him out.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>45</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>44.</hi> he saith that <hi>Stapleton</hi> doth not appropriate the text in <hi>Mat. 17.21.</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> but pag. <hi>45.</hi> he saith, that <hi>Thyreus</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> both doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that text of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues, who (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their <hi>miraculous faith</hi>) should also haue prayed.</item>

         <hi>46</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>42.49.50.</hi> he so vnderstandeth these words of <hi>Christ (this kind goeth not forth)</hi> as if they should containe in them an exception of the <hi>particular,</hi> from out of the <hi>generall:</hi> but pag. <hi>46.</hi> hee saith that hee taketh that <hi>sense</hi> to be very vnsound, and contrarie to the meaning of <hi>Christ.</hi>

         <hi>47</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>49.</hi> hee distinguisheth <hi>diuels</hi> by their sundrie sorts, degrees, or orders: but pag. <hi>51.</hi> hee distinguisheth them by their only naturall qualities: as malice, crueltie, &amp;c.</item>

         <hi>48</hi> In his doctrine, pag. <hi>59.</hi> he saith God is at libertie, and not tied to meanes: but pag. <hi>61.</hi> he tieth him fast to <hi>meanes</hi>; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs that if <hi>God</hi> hath appointed a thing to come to passe by this or that <hi>meanes,</hi> then the <hi>meanes</hi> must be vsed, or els that thing will neuer come to passe.</item>

         <hi>49</hi> In his doctrine pag. <hi>2.</hi> hee saith, it is absurd to affirme that the <hi>diuell</hi> (being without a man) can dispose of the whole or ante part of mans bodie: but detection, pag. <hi>110.</hi> he saith that the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> (in all probability) did vse <hi>Sommers</hi> his tongue; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee was essentiallie and sensiblie playing boe peepe vnder the couerled.</item>
