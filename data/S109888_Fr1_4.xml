   <head>VPON THE BATTAILE OF <hi>AGINCOVRT,</hi> VVRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEN BY HIS DEARE FRIEND MICHAEL DRAYTON Esquire.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>HAd <hi>Henryes</hi> name beene only met in Prose,</l>
      <l>Recorded by the humble wit of those</l>
      <l>Who write of lesse then Kings: who Victory,</l>
      <l>As calmely mention, as a Pedigree,</l>
      <l>The French alike with vs, might view his name</l>
      <l>His actions too, and not confesse a shame:</l>
      <l>Nay, grow at length, so boldly troublesome,</l>
      <l>As to dispute if they were ouercome.</l>
      <l>But thou hast wakt their feares: thy fiercer hand</l>
      <l>Hath made their shame as lasting, as their land.</l>
      <l>By thee againe they are compeld to know</l>
      <l>How much of Fate is in an English foe.</l>
      <l>They bleed afresh by thee, and thinke the harme</l>
      <l>Such; they could rather wish, t'were <hi>Henries</hi> arme,</l>
      <l>Who thankes thy painefull quill; and holds it more</l>
      <l>To be thy Subiect now, then King before.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>By thee he conquers yet; when eu'ry wora</l>
      <l>Yeelds him a fuller honour, then his sword.</l>
      <l>Strengthens his actions against time: by thee,</l>
      <l>He Victory, and <hi>France,</hi> doth hold in fee,</l>
      <l>So well obseru'd he is, that eu'ry thing,</l>
      <l>Speakes him not only English, but a King.</l>
      <l>And <hi>France,</hi> in this, may boast her fortunate,</l>
      <l>That she was worthy of so braue a hate.</l>
      <l>Her suffering is her gayue. How well we see</l>
      <l>The Battaile labour'd worthy him, and thee,</l>
      <l>Where we may Death discouer with delight,</l>
      <l>And entertaine a pleasure from a fight.</l>
      <l>Where wee may see how well it doth become</l>
      <l>The brau'ry of a Prince to ouer come.</l>
      <l>What <hi>Povver</hi> is a Poet: that can add</l>
      <l>A life to Kings, more glorious, then they had</l>
      <l>For what of <hi>Henry,</hi> is vnsung by thee,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Henry</hi> doth want of his Eternity.</l>
