   <head>To the vnderstander.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are not euery bodie, to you (as
to one of my very few friends) I may
be bold to vtter my minde, nor is it
more empaire to an honest and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
mans sufficiencie to haue few
friendes, then to an Homericall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme
to haue few commenders; for
neyther doe common dispositions
keepe fitte or plausible consort with iudiciall and simple
honestie, nor are idle capacities comprehensible of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate
Poeme. My Epistle dedicatorie before my seuen
bookes, is accounted darke and too much laboured: for
the darkenes there is nothing good or bad, hard or softe,
darke or perspicuous but in respect, &amp; in respect of mens
light, sleight, or enuious perusalles (to whose loose capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
any worke worthily composde is knit with a riddle)
&amp; that the stile is materiall flowing, &amp; not ranke, it may
perhaps seeme darke, to ranke riders or readers, that haue
no more soules then burbolts: but to your comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; in it selfe, I know it is not. For the affected labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in it, I protest two morninges both ended it and
the Readers Epistle: but the truth is, my desire &amp; strange
disposition in all thinges I write, is to set downe vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and most profitable coherents for the time: yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remoued from abhorde affectation, then from the
most popular and cold disgestion. And I euer imagine
<pb facs="6"/>
that as Italian &amp; French Poems to our studious linguistes,
win much of their discountryed affection, as well because
the vnderstanding of forreigne tongues is sweete to their
apprehension, as that the matter &amp; inuention is pleasing,
so my farre fetcht, and as it were beyond sea manner of
writing, if they would take as much paines for their poore
countrimen as for a proud stranger when they once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, should be much more gracious to their choice
conceiptes, then a discourse that fals naked before them,
and hath nothing but what mixeth it selfe with ordinarie
table talke. For my varietie of new wordes, I haue none
Inckepot I am sure you know, but such as I giue pasport
with such authoritie, so significant and not ill sounding,
that if my countrey language were an vsurer, or a man of
this age speaking it, hee would thanke mee for enriching
him: Why alas will my young mayster the reader affect
nothing common, and yet like nothing extraordinarie?
Swaggering is a new worde amongst them, and rounde
headed custome giues it priuiledge with much imitation,
being created as it were by a naturall <hi>Prosopopeia</hi> without
etimologie or deriuation; and why may not an elegancie
authentically deriued, &amp; as I may say of the vpper house,
bee entertayned as well in their lower consultation with
authoritie of Arte, as their owne forgeries lickt vp by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
All tongues haue inricht themselues from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
(onely the Hebrew &amp; Greeke which are not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
amongst vs) with good neighbourly borrowing, and
as with infusion of fresh ayre, and nourishment of newe
blood in their still growing bodies, &amp; why may not ours?
<hi>Chaucer</hi> (by whom we will needes authorise our true en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish)
had more newe wordes for his time then any man
needes to deuise now. And therefore for currant wits to
<pb facs="7"/>
crie from standing braines, like a broode of Frogs from a
ditch, to haue the ceaselesse flowing riuer of our tongue
turnde into their Frogpoole, is a song farre from their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of sweetnes, &amp; a sin wold soone bring the plague
of barbarisme amongst vs; which in faith needes not bee
hastned with defences of his ignorant furtherers, since it
comes with mealemouth'd toleration too sauagely vpon
vs. To be short; since I had the reward of my labours in
their consummation, and the chiefe pleasure of them in
mine owne profit, no young preiudicate or castigatorie
braine hath reason to thinke I stande trembling vnder the
ayry stroke of his feuerie censure, or that I did euer expect
any flowing applause from his drie fingers; but the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and delight that might probably redound to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
true louer of vertue I set in the seat of mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and contentment; and if there be any one in whome
this successe is enflowred, a few sprigges of it shall bee my
garland. Since then this neuer equald Poet is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and so full of gouernment and direction to all
estates; sterne anger and the affrights of warre, bearing
the mayne face of his subiect; soldiers shall neuer spende
their idle howres more profitablie, then with his studious
and industrious perusall; in whose honors his deserts are
infinite: Counsellors haue neuer better oracles then his
lines: fathers haue no morales so profitable for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as his counsailes: nor shal they euer giue them more
honord iniunctions, then to learne <hi>Homer</hi> without book,
that being continually conuersant in him, his height may
descend to their capacities, and his substance proue their
worthiest riches. Husbands, wiues, louers, friends, and
allies, hauing in him mirrors for all their duties; all sortes
of which concourse and societie in other more happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="7"/>
haue in steed of sonnets &amp; lasciuious ballades, sung his
Iliades. Let the length of the verse neuer discourage your
endeuours: for talke our quidditicall Italianistes of what
proportion soeuer their strooting lips affect; vnlesse it be in
these coopplets, into which I haue hastely translated this
Shield, they shall neuer doe <hi>Homer</hi> so much right, in any
octaues, canzons, canzonets, or with whatsoeuer fustian
Epigraphes they shall entitle their measures. Onely the
extreame false printing troubles my conscience, for feare
of your deserued discouragement in the empaire of our
Poets sweetnes; whose generall diuinitie of spirit,
clad in my willing labours (enuious of none
nor detracting any) I commit to your
good nature and solid
capacitie.</p>
