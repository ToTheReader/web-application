   <head>THE EPISTLE of the Authour.</head>
   <head type="sub">To the Right Reuerend, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Abbesse of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>S. Clare</hi> at <hi>Gandia,</hi> his deare Aunt, and Lady in Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HERAS my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire (Right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mother) was in some part to giue you satisfaction, for the many troubles and afflictions,
<pb facs="8"/> which by my sinnes I haue caused you; I thought I could not do it better, by any other way, then by good workes. But finding thē wholy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my selfe, I began to thinke, how I might come to attaine thereto, by practice, and meditating on the most holy works of Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, hoping by his merits, and examples to be at last able to do some good therein. And therefore in this Treatise (which I call <hi>An Exercise of Christian workes</hi>) I haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and set down some things which seeme to me, may in part serue for the making you that satisfaction, whereof I
<pb facs="8"/> spake before. These, most res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Mother, I now adresse &amp; present to you, beseeching you to assist me with your prayers therein, since of my selfe, I am in that kind so weake and insufficient, as I dare not aduenture to make you recompēce without your owne help.</p>
   <p>And no lesse indeed doe you owe (if not to me, yet at least) to your Lord and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Christ Iesus, who offered himselfe vp to his Heauenly Father, vpon the Crosse, for our sinnes. And seeing (as the Holy Prophet sayth) God rendreth to euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his workes; we must
<pb facs="9"/> imbrace that counsaile of the Apostle, when he admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth vs, <hi>to worke, and do good towards all, whilst we haue tyme: For the night will come</hi> (saith S. Iohn) <hi>when none can worke.</hi> Wherefore, as soone as any good worke is conceaued and approued by the iudgment of Reason, and so admitted and accepted of the Will, as that it be determined to do what may be most to the glory of God, or profit of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; it must diligently, and without delay be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and execution. For if we neglect to do good, when we may, and are able; great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will returne vnto vs
<pb facs="9"/> thereby: and better had it byn not to haue made any purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se therof at al, then afterward not to fullfill, or neglect the same.</p>
   <p>It is a common saying, that, <hi>Hell is full of good desires:</hi> howbeit I hould, that there is not a more soueraign antidote or more present remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst euil, then the dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of good workes. For if a man haue sinned, they help him greatly towardes the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer, and forsaking of sinne: if he be to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he cannot performe it better then by good works: if he haue a desire of perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in doing well, he may
<pb facs="10"/> not better or more readily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, then by good workes. For as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> sayth, <hi>they that worke in me shall not sinne.</hi> And we are to take example of the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> who sayth in like manner, <hi>My worke is with God:</hi> and all our workes are to be done in God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his glory, for so they will be stable and permanent for euer. And because our works cannot be pleasing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but by Christ; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs offer them vnto him, accompanied with the workes of his only &amp; dearely beloued Sonne Iesus, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that by his merits and grace, they may be admitted
<pb facs="10"/> into the sight of God. For Christ did put on our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he might cloath vs with his riches; and vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to walke, eate, fast, sleep, watch, &amp; to do like workes for our profit, that we might offer them to his Father; and by that oblation reape vnto our soules no small vtility. And though euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his particuler talent giuen him by God, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more or lesse by the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of Christian Workes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this direction of ours: yet haue we thought it not amisse to set downe in the ensuing Treatise some few thinges, touching this point, that may
<pb facs="11"/> at least instruct, and giue light to the ruder sort, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of spirit and deuotion.</p>
