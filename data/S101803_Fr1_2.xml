      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering how the body of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

a most dangerous and incurable d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

which doth not onely trouble the

      </gap>yning of others. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
whereof, a number of good spirits pricked forward with
a Christian and laudable zeale, haue indeuored their best, these
fiftie yeares, to root out the maladie by such medicines as they
suppose most conuenient and wholsome, yet doe they all what
they could: they could neuer heale the wound perfectly. So that
the bodie diseased, falleth downe still oftentimes into far worse
case then at the first, and me thinke the cause is, for that they
haue not looked with tbe eie of their vnderstanding, to the first
causes and beginnings, from whence this sicknes should grow,
but went no further then to stop the course of her effects, like
<pb facs="3"/>
the Phisition, who seeketh to cure onely the paines &amp; accidents
of a disease, neuer touching the root &amp; cause therof: the which
in space of time, recouering newe force and rigour doth bud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and is as bad &amp; worse then euer it was, which is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
true in Phisicke, but in all other affairs of the world. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
deepe was the iudgement of the Latine Poet: who reputeth
<hi>that man happy who can knowe the cause of thinges.</hi>
For <hi>Aristotle</hi> also witnesseth with him, that the <hi>ignorance
thereof breedeth manifolde errors.</hi> Seeing then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of mens iudgements concerning the cause and curing
of this maladie, comming nothing neere the truth; some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were a muster of ignorance, which dimmeth so their
sight, that they cannot see well: others, because they suffer thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be caried away with their own passion; affectionat only
to some one particular partie: &amp; other some, because they go no
further, but to remedie onely some particular effects, and leaue
the cause vntouched: I haue thought good pitiyng this langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
and sick bodie, so to represent and liuely set down the cause
and cure of this disease, that it shalbe long of her selfe, if she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
not perfect health. Neither let any be afraid to take this
wholsome medicine which I wil prescribe, being no violent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suie,
or Antimoyne, nor deare as is the tincture of <hi>Sol,</hi> for I
present but a sweet decoction, to purifie the crooked sinew, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor
of the sight of the vnderstanding, to purge the Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionall
and Occidentall peoples of a grosse humour ingendred
in them, by reason of the grosnes, and coldnes of the aier wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they liue, which letteth them for seeing so clearly into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of state, and the gouernment of this world, as doe the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are more Meridionall who being aware of so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
can so cunningly handle the matter, to make vs fall
togeather by the eares, to weaken and ouer-throwe our selues by
our owne forces and armes, thereby to make v<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

purloyned our domination &amp; riches into their own hands: but
especially those, who haue the Sea so neare their noses, that they
can euery way trade and trafficke with other peoples, as are the
Grecians, Carthaginians, Florentins, Venetians, &amp; other Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
their like: who if they may discouer but the least entrance
to set in foot amongst the Septentrionals, they will straight be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deuise and practise so great shifts and subtilties, that they
wil make them breake asunder all bonds of amity, and flesh them
to ruine one another like cruell and sauage beasts, causing an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of bloud amongst the best of the Countrey by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and so to grow to make quarels and take parts, when they
see them feeble and in miserie, and then to fish for their riches
and dignities, euen as in a troubled water, men catch and kil fish
best, when they cannot be discried. Wherefore, many of those
whome the heauen hath inriched with a clearnes of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
aboue the rest, haue great need to be aided herein. Some
attributing the spring of these mischiefes, to the darknes and
obscuritie of the holy Scriptures, wherein for all that they are
deceiued, seeing that it in some requireth of vs, but to loue God
and our neighbour, to fly from euill, and to doe good. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the corruption of man doth hinder him to beleeue in him
who hath absolutely fulfilled all, and shed his bloud for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of all our sinnes, vsing only certaine Sacraments after the
holy institution of him and his holy Apostles: some others think
that the diuerse interpretations there abouts, and about other
texts of Scripture, are the cause of all this mischiefe, and are of
opinion, that to interprete and expound truely these places and
passages of Scriptures, is the very best meane and remedy to
deliuer all Christendome from all these troubles: and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
do the Diuines fall out, and backbite one another by contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious
speaches, euery where defaming one another shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but the expositions that they condemne, and wherupon they
are so at variance, are but thrids spun by some of the more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridionall
<pb facs="4"/>
nations: who when they perceiue how they can set vs
together by the ears, they know how to inuent store of such new
obscurities and shifts to trouble vs, if we will giue them leaue a
little to come in amongst vs into our Countries: where they
will shew themselues alwais with prophane knowledge to teach
vs how we shall goe to heauen, or els inflamed with a burning
zeale for the publi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke good of all our Countrey. Although if
we be so wise as to looke well into them, we shall soone discouer
their mines, how they doe but seeke to reape some profite out of
our ruines, and to make their hand by vs. We must then cast
our eies vpon the good instruction, that nature or rather the
Authour therof doth set before vs visibly: For he hauing laid
and set the Alpes most high mountaines, so firme and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
on the one side, and the deepe Seas on the other, for bars
betweene vs and them, that we should not go to one another,
teacheth vs, if we will take his instruction, we should dispose of
all that concerneth our State, apart: and shut vp from them al
accesse or entrance into our Countrey by the reasons and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of things already past, which shall more amply be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>scourse, prepared for a generall remedy for vs all,
whether we be Catholiques or Protestants, to recouer full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
and health of these maladies, which so long time haue
oppressed and troubled vs: hoping by the grace and bles<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing of
the most highest, it shall worke some great effects in those, who
shall vse these preparatiues, which are first of all presented vnto
them, before the taking of more strong medicines, and harder
phisicke. Now, for that the gouernour of the whole world, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to haue turned his fauourable countenance towardes vs,
hauing giuen the royall Scepter into your Maiesties hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extracted out of a more Meridionall quarter then your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours
were, and also in giuing vs, who are neighbours of
the great Ocean-sea, a wiser and more ingenious King, then
those before time haue bene: to the end that we being lightned
<pb facs="4"/>
by so bright and glorious a starre, the quicke and subtill Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may no more abuse vs, so that we shall no more bee exposed
to the lamentable miseries, into the which they were woont to
bring vs headlong, as men altogether blind andegrosse-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
at their owne lust and pleasure. And this is the cause why
I haue presumed to dedicate this discourse vnto your M. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that it shalbe rather liked and approoued of you, then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who being more Septentrionals haue their spirites more
dull and nothing so quicke and pliable, assuring also my selfe,
that if it please you to receiue it with a fauorable countenance,
that onely shall giue it a far more free passage to all those, who
are your most affectionate seruants: Now, I will pray the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord and God to inuirone your M. with his speciall
protection in the middest of all the perils and daungers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you are besieged, establishing your throwne in all
iustice and godlines, according to his most holie
will and pleasure.</p>
