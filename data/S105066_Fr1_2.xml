   <p>AFter I had discharged the charge laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Court; and was presently after, sollicited by some of your Honourable Societie, to present to the eye, what I had deliuered to the eare.
<pb facs="3"/>
Though at first, I was indeed very vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, at their intreatie: yet, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by your Honourable Court to publish what before you had intreated mee to Preach; and weighing well with my selfe, that words spoken, are soone come, soone gone; but that written withall, they make a deeper impre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>ion: for, by striking as well the Eye of the Reader, as the Eare of the Hearer, they peirce his heart the better, and saue his soule the sooner. Hereupon, that I might testifie how much I honour your lawful Commandements; and withall, that I might confirme with my Pen that grace, which it pleased God to worke by my Voyce; I haue now yeelded to all of your Requests, making that common to all, which then was imparted but to some: onely in desire some way to witnesse my dutifull respect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o your Honourable Court, and loue to your Noble Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, seeing many of your Noble and worthy Company haue spent a great part of their painefully gained estates vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this honourable Action; and reioyce
<pb facs="3"/>
in nothing more then in this, that God hath giuen them a price in their hand, and a heart to vse it for the furthering of this glorious Worke; How could I, at so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest intreatie, refuse to adventure this Mite of mine, among so many worthie Adventures of theirs? How could I (I say) refuse to make their publique <hi>Bountie,</hi> and your publique <hi>Thankesgiuing,</hi> yet more publique?</p>
   <p>If your Honours will be pleased to take in good part what now I impart; it may proue a spurre vnto me, to vndertake some bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>er piece of seruice for the good of your noble Plantation; at least, if it lie in my poore power to bring it to passe. Thus intreating your Honours fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptance, I rest</p>
