   <head>TO THE WORTHILY ENOBLED, THE HIGH AND MOST <hi>HONOVRABLE</hi> MARQVIS <hi>OF</hi> BVCKINGHAM, WITH ALL HIS OTHER WELL <hi>DESERUING TITLES,</hi> and attributes.</head>
   <p>Right Honourable,</p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the diuine Maiestie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and works to some speciall end and purpose, redacting the world out of a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> for the vse of man to a beautifull vniformity; raising man out of a heape of dust to glorifie his Creator: sending his only Son to redeeme vs from the curse of the law, an expiation for our rebellious transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and proposing his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
with equall distribution as the mastring curbs of all humane endeauours: with such like. So should we erect the frame of our actions vpon the foundation of preuailing effects, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing without a speciall limitation. For euen little children, that sport in the aire at randome can say, they meant to exercise themselues, or in emulation to shoot higher then their fellowes. This inciteth me (right Honorable) to anticipate their calumniation, or derision, that shall startle me with these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, why I presumed like a seeled doue to flie at randome with such disguises, and amongst all others firmed my selfe on the sun-shining beautie of your house. I answere both with the same truth and plainesse, that detruded me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the streights of censuring imperfections: Besides the manifest reasons inserted in the Title and Preface, An honest fame, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture orderly profit to maintaine a poore liberty of life, and keepe vertue vnspotted
<pb facs="3"/>
from the filthinesse of corruption, were the markes of my aime. But concerning your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, an earnest desire to prostrate my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours before you, and a meere presaging confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that with vndefiled vowes you will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preserue the loue of our Countrey, impulsed this insinuation, and extended the Argument thus farre; that as it hath pleased his Maiesty to ouermantle you with fauour, and support you with greatnesse (wherein Princes make their vertues truly eminent, and worthily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted) so you will remember, that the good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant augmented his tallent; and he liues not at all, who liues onely to himselfe. Therefore Great Lord let me I pray you behold you like a faire moouing Planet in a sufficient Orbe, from whose influence can proceede nothing but sweete presages, and if there be any thing in these triuiall discourses, that may boast of your acceptation, and noble construction, make me the prouder, because I come so simply naked
<pb facs="4"/>
without palpable flattery, or cunning display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Fame and merit. Besides, howeuer I am so great a stranger, that not so much as the sound of my name hath passed by your eares, so low a shrubbe, that I stand at a stay, and keepe my owne greennes, and so ruinous a wall, that euen bosome friends haue started away for feare of falling vpon them: I must be yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and hope, you will not search me so narrowly as vpon the discouerie of my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to pretend my contempt, nor dismisse me vilipended, when all the world hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed your worth. In which assurance I thus cast my selfe into the open mouth of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the world, <hi>Opinion:</hi> and presume to be preserued by the <hi>Antidote</hi> of your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage from any dangerous infection, or Lethal ruine.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Your Honors humble obseruant,</hi>
   </p>
