   <p>
      <hi>NOt onely are the works of God to be reuerenced &amp; regarded in themselues, but also in respect of the most wise and excellent course &amp; order of the contriuing and disposing of them.</hi> God hath made all things beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in the time and season thereof. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>And Act.</hi> 15. 18. From the beginning of the world God knoweth all his workes, <hi>saith the Apostle Iames. His meaning is that he knoweth them so, that according to his foreknowledge he hath most wisely disposed euery one of them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>It must needs be acknowledged therfore, that it is the dutie of all that desire to be wise in the Lord, to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of him, both in his workes, and also in the orderly course of effecting them, according as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath in his holy Scriptures reuealed the same.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>To this purpose is that which Moses writeth Deut.</hi> 4, 32. Inquire now of the dayes that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man vpon the earth, &amp; aske from the one end of the heauen to the other, if there came to passe such a great thing as this, or whether any such like thing hath bene heard, &amp;c. <hi>And that which we reade in the</hi> 111. <hi>Psal. vers.</hi> 2. 3. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The works of the Lord are great, and ought to be sought out of all those that loue them. His worke is beautifull and glorious, his righteousnesse indureth for euer. He hath made his wonderfull works to be had in remembrance, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And verily, if we weigh things with a right iudgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>, we shal find that this is the very end wherefore God hath created time it selfe, and placed the Sunne and the Moon</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>in the firmament for the distinction of the day and the night, and that they shuld be for signes and for seasons, for dayes and for yeares, for summer and for winter, Gen.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>&amp;c. and chap.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>For these are but the Vshers as it were, to point vs to the word of God, as to the head master &amp; teacher of his schoole▪ that frō thence we might learne not so much what God hath done in making the world for mā, as what he hath done in the world for the praise of his glorie euer since he hath made the same: and chiefly what course he hath taken for the renewing of the world euer since mankind hath corrupted and disordered the same. For want of which obseruation, our Sauiour Christ, the true sunne of righteousnesse, earnestly blameth the Iewes, for that they obseruing the signes of faire and foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. altogether neglected the signes of the time, and season of his comming vnto them. Mat.</hi> 16. 1. 2. 3. <hi>All the excellent works of God are so chained &amp; linked together, that we cannot well know the latter without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the former. As a help therfore hereunto, serueth this present Chronologising of the holy Scriptures. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two things haue bene intended and indeuoured: the one plainnesse, the other shortnesse, and in either of them as much certainty as could be attained vnto for the helpe of the Christian Reader, from the expresse and entier dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Scriptures themselues. God of his mercie vouchsafe his blessing vpon it to all good ends and vses whereunto it may serue thee, to his honor and glory, euen for our Lord Iesus Christs sake.</hi> Amen.</p>
   <p>Thine in the Lord.</p>
