   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is true which is spokē in the Castilian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, <hi>El bien no es conocido, hasta que es per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dido, The good is not knowen vntill it be lost;</hi> as I haue at last found by experience in my selfe, who haue, but since my late Trauels, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehended what TIME is, nor vnderstood the power and value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: which verily doth not a little griue and vexe me,
<pb facs="6"/>in that all this while I lost so much good. Wherefore I could hartily desire with the Poet,</p>
   <q>O si praeteritos referat mihi Iupiter annos!</q>
   <p>That, if it wre possible, I might once againe enioy the yeares that are already past, whereby I might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them as I ought, and redeeme them from the captiuitie wherein they haue beene detained. But he who once so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded to knowe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate the Time as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, is nowe well worthy to wish and want that which sometimes he had in aboundance and
<pb facs="6"/>vainely mispent. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I hold it for a speciall gift and grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me of GOD, that now at length he hath vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed me this knowledge, that henceforth I may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imploy the time which the Lord in mercy shall hereafter graunt vnto me; and that now I throughly vnderstand what it is to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to know God in Christ, to worship him only; to read the Scriptures, to heare Gods word, to be partaker of the Sacraments, and to pray in a knowne tongue; which I speake not as if I had beene at any time affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb facs="7"/>otherwise then now I am, but because I neuer heretofore esteemed either TIME, or any of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites according to their iust value and worth, as now I do.</p>
   <p>And in this respect I could wish all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute me their Proctor &amp; Aduocate aswell to sue for their ransome; as also to teach and instruct such negligent Sinners as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Time</hi> captiuated, how they ought to <hi>Redeeme</hi> the same, &amp; how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes and imports them; to admonish secure and carelesse Christians right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to waigh the Benefites
<pb facs="7"/>which in great abundance GOD hath mercifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon this Church and Common wealth; and to beseech all others that they loose neither houre nor moment of any Time or Season.</p>
   <p>For accomplishment whereof I desire all men to peruse this small Manual, wherein they may plainely vnderstand &amp; learne, both how and from what TIME is to be redeemed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in what sort they ought to imploy the same. And though haply some men may thinke that in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of TIME much Time may be spent (which
<pb facs="8"/>though otherwise I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge may be true,) yet hold I not the Time imployde in this Treatise, either lost or ill spent.</p>
   <p>I hartily pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech our Lord GOD, euen for his most precious bloud sake (which was the price of our Redemption) that euen as I wish and desire, so this <hi>Redemption of Time lost,</hi> may be beneficiall and profitable to the Reader.</p>
