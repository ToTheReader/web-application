      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I haue often catched at some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to giue publike testimony of my thankefull remembring your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Fathers kind euery, performed to me. A duty it was, to present freely: to me a Kindnesse, that I was selected. The recompence expected I haue carefully made good, by instructing my people; with what industry, God knowes: with what fruit (I thanke God) many soules can witnesse. This kind of testimony I the rather embraced, for that it afforded occasion, to cleare my selfe of some fond impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and of stopping the mouthes of vnreasonable men, that (euen for paines) haue made me their by-word. It were long, to reckon vp all slanders of the malicious. These are the chiefe, <hi>Vnlearned, singular, turbulent, factious.</hi> As touching <hi>Learning,</hi> I neuer much vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but <hi>by the grace of God I am that I am.</hi> He knowes much,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Phil</hi> 3 10 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 2.2 <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22</note> that <hi>knowes Christ crucified and the vertue of his resurrection:</hi> yet, had I the learning of <hi>Moses, who was skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians,</hi> yea, the knowledge of men and Angels, I would endeuour in preaching to obscure my selfe, that the power might bee knowne to be of God For <hi>Singularity,</hi> this is mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology; single I may go, (more shame for those should keepe me company:) singular, I am sure I am not, sith neyther I affect lonenesse (would God all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, all Prophets, labourers!) and the course I held, is

         <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.15.</note> and <hi>Issachar loues his ease:</hi> yet thus I resolue; rather then lose heauen, to go alone; and neuer to be so good a fellow, as to run (with Idlers) to hell for company. My <hi>Turbulentnes,</hi> let these things witnes; my parting with many rights for peace sake: disgesting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, I say, not onely without Reuenge, but euen without seeking for iust defence: raylings, slanders, assaults, hazard of life, indeed what not? and vnlesse they will indite mee for not admitting <hi>sicam totam</hi> into my bowells,<note place="margin">Cic. pro Rosc. Amerin.</note> I know not what show of turbulentnesse they can accuse me of. For <hi>Faction,</hi> let my courses speake: in regard of the Church, for doctrine <hi>I</hi> teach none but what she professeth: for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, throughout conformable to the orders prescribed. If this be the matter, <hi>that the multitude is deuided,</hi> the cause would be inquired, whether mine, or Gods. Not where dissentions are, there presently is the Preacher facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It hath euer bene one <hi>Accidentall</hi> effect of the Gospel, <hi>to worke seperation:</hi>

And let others please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their peaceable Ministery, <hi>I</hi> shall neuer thinke hee knowes the vse of the <hi>Fanne,</hi>
