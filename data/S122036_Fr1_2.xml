   <head>¶To the Godly reader Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bull wysheth grace and peace
with vnfayned fayeth and a
good conscience in
Christ Iesus our
Lorde.</head>
   <p>IT hath alwayes bene the practise
of Sathan and his subtill souldiers
the papistes, euen the sworne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
of Gods truth, that when
thei can not preuail against the same
by tyrannye and tormentes, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
to deface it by most impudente
sclaunders and lyes (the chiefest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and staye of their kingedome)
as thou shalt see (good reader) in this
treatise folowynge. For when they
coulde by no tiranny nor cruel hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
dyscourage this man of God
frome the constante confession of the
truth, they stirred vp most shamfull &amp;
cursed lies against him that he should
be a priuye maintayner of suche as
cursed the Quene, but to their owne
perpetuall shame and ignomye. For
whilest they haue soughte by thys
<pb facs="3"/>
meane to bringe Gods eternall veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
in to contempte and too make it
more odious to the worlde: what els
haue they done but dysclosed theyr
owne wickednes and malice and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him occasion so to paint out their
falsehode and lyinge spirite in their
righte coloures, by this pithye, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and worthy little pece of worke:
that all men may hereby clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
whose children they are, and
they them selues shall nede no other
glasse to see how like their father thei
looke, the father of all falsehode and
lyes. And to the ende that this theyr
wicked dealinge, whiche haue thus
proudly set them selues against God
and agaynste his Christ in his poore
members, may be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> better knowen &amp;
regestred to the worlde and the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to come, to their shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and to the auauncing of gods
glorye in the innocente sufferinge of
his saintes, thus torne and rente by
tiranny, tormentes, lyes, and sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for his names sake: beholde
the prouidence of god, who hath now
<pb facs="3"/>
brought this worke to lighte, which
otherwise by the negligence of some
was like to pearishe. And here haue
I iust occasion to discommende those
men whiche do defraude the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of such worthye monuments.
Greate was the care of this blessed
man and other for the church of God,
and manye frutefull workes did they
write in prison, in bands, in setters,
but fewe are come to lighte: and shal
we like carelesse and ingratfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
suffer these Godly laboures, these
painfull trauales, thus to pearishe?
how desirous thei were to haue them
published, to wytnesse to the worlde
that whiche they taughte and sealed
with theyr bloud, and to profyt their
bretheren: it appeareth by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
earnest request to the readers of
this treatise, which is that they wyll
not kepe it close to thē selues, but as
sone as thei haue red it, set it abroad &amp;
communicate it to other. And that
request whyche he make the concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this treatise, do I here general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
make in his name and others and
<pb facs="4"/>
in the behalfe of the churche of God
for the rest of their workes, to them
in whose hands they remayne, that
they wyll not suffer them to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
any longer (for that is it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
Sathan and the ennemies of the
crosse of Christ do mooste desire) but
cause thē to be set abroad in printe to
the cōmodity of many. And trulye it
mighte seeme to be a laboure no lesse
cōmendable for the learned then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the houshold of God to be
as diligent in searchinge and setting
foorth of suche worthye works, as in
penning and publishing of new. So
full are they of heauenlye doctryne,
so full of power of Gods spirite, so
full of comforte, and consolation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
wrytten as it were out of gods
sanctuary, wyth the fynger of God,
by menne euen then out of the world
and in heauen alreadye: that in dede
thei are most worthy to be sought for
as precious Iewelles and treasures.</p>
   <p>For God knowethe what lacke
we haue of such trumpettes to stirre
vppe oure dull hartes in these daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouse
<pb facs="4"/>
dayes, wherein all states of
menne haue turned this greate bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge
of God bestowed vppon vs (I
meane theese breathinge dayes and
tyme of rest from antichristes tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye)
in to a securitye, and are become
like men rocked a sleepe. And manye
that semed to be zelous, earnest, and
constant in the Lords quarell so long
as theese captaynes were in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle,
and they them selues wyth in
the sounde of the trumpette, are now
well cooled. Praye wee therefore
that the Lorde woulde warme them,
heate them, enflame them agayne
wyth the zeale of hys house, that we
maye haue manye suche valyaunte
captaynes, suche worthye prelates
and sheepeheardes as thys was, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
theyr lambes watchful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in preachynge dylygente and
paynefull, in zeale feruente, harty,
and syncere, and of lyke fortytude of
spirit to helpe and maintayn the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailinge
saith of the gospell, that we
may enioy styll this fatherly blessing
<pb facs="5"/>
of our gratious God, and escape the
wrath to come and plagues at hande
for our vnworthy receauinge againe
of this greate benefite of his woorde
and libertye of conscience. Whhiche
plagues we maye assuredlye loke for
with double woo, vnlesse by speedye
repentaunce we seke, to remoue the
cause thereof. God for hys
Christes sake, graunte vs
hartelye, earnestlye,
and effectuouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
so to do.</p>
