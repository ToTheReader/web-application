      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the dayes of daunger and iniquitie are as now, not onelie our own fraile nature maye sufficiently certefie vs: but also the irk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>some examples, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted prodigious spectacles, euery day and houre (almost) apparant in our eies, may driue frō vs anye doubt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. For if we enter into examination with our selues, aswell of our negligence of duetie to our God, as also our lacke of looue to our neighbour: wee shall finde that we are not, neither doo as the holie Euangelist wisheth vs, when he saith:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.7.</note>
      <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, let vs looue one an other, for loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God, and euerie one that looueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God: But he that loueth not, knoweth not God, for God is Loue.</hi> And I find in <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> these words.
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Three thinges reioyce me, and by them am I beautified before God and men:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccle. 25.1.</note>
      <hi>the vnitie of Brethren, the looue of neighboures, &amp; a man and wife that agree together.</hi> Howe then can we otherwise iudge, but that we are in that yron and crooked age, wherein iniquitie should vaunt &amp; shew her selfe: beeing made acquainted euery day with the lack of that heauenly ornamēt, Loue, the memory thereof almost defaced and puld vp by the roote, in so greeuous and vehement manner, that it may be hardly sayde to haue anie abiding amonge vs at all. And that I may not wade into abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of matter, without due proofe to affirme anye thinge alleadged: I praye you looke into these Tragicall accidents following, whiche, albeit they carrye terrour sufficient, to forwarne the vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall children of this worlde: yet daylie doo fresh enormities spring vp, able (had nature so agreed) to vrge the verie bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles of the earth, to yeelde foorth feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acclamations agaynst vs. Shall I with-hold to say, that the father hath not procured the death of his owne naturall
<pb facs="3"/>childe: and the childe risen in like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion agaynst his Father? Shall I not saye, the Husband hath abrydged the lyfe of his espoused Wife and mate, &amp; she like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise committed the like vnnaturall acte on her Husband? Hath not one Brother murdered the other, one neighbour kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the other, one frend been false to the other, yea, &amp; very nature turned agaynst it self? These vnlooked for examples are daily before vs, so that wee cannot shun the sight &amp; hearing of thē, &amp; yet shal we passe them ouer with a slender or lighte regarde? Oh my freends, doo we not see the heauens frowne? And why? Because the sinnes of the earth hath fumed vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nosethrils of the Almightie, with a sauour so yrksome &amp; vnsufferable: that he cannot in Iustice, but strike stiff-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Pharao,</hi> with the rodde of his furie, yea, and bereaue the earth of those bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolent blessinges, which he hath suffered it so quietly to enioye, and so great abuse rendered vnto him for them. Can wee reprooue the Father for disinheriting his Sonne, when hee seeeth his dealynges
<pb facs="4"/>such as deserueth nothing? can we blame that maister, who thrusteth his seruaunt foorth of his doores, when he beholdeth his behauiour vnworthy of house-room? Euen so, can wee otherwise say, that our heauenly father dooth vnworthily cast vs out of his fauour, when in steade of looue, we render him hatred, for dutie, negligence, and for all his good gifts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious thanks? Oh no, let vs not enter into suche questioning with our selues, for if we looke into our iniquitie, &amp; thē into his mercie, our daily falling from one sinne into an other, and his so long fatherly forbearance: we wil then quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie returne frō the flesh pots of Aegypt, and from our owne filthie and odious vomit, and euerie one of vs say hartelie with the Psalmist:<note place="margin">Psal. 51.3.</note>
      <hi>I do knowe mine owne wickednes, and my sinne is euer against me.</hi> And likewise confesse with <hi>Danyel</hi> the Prophet:<note place="margin">Daniel 9.9.10.</note>
      <hi>To thee (O Lord God) belongeth mercie and forgiuenes, for wee haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thee, and haue not harkened to thy voyce, wherby we might walke in thy lawes which thou hast appointed for vs.</hi> It is high
<pb facs="4"/>time that we should thus consider with our selues, if wee but looke into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions offered vnto vs, and mark how busie the deuil is to woork mās vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerthrow: the rather by 2. greeuous &amp; horrible mischances which hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened, wherin may be seene, how needefull it is for vs to call for the grace of our heauenly father, to strengthen vs with such assured confidence, that we fall not likewise into such euil, but may shew such hartie repentance of our former offences, as the verie wicked by our good example, maye bee drawne to glorify the eternall GOD.</p>
