   <p>ALthough (curteous Reader) I am young in yeares, and more defectiue in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that little smatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Learning which I haue obtained, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruit of such vacant houres, as I could spare from affaires befitting my Sex, yet am I not altogether ignorant of that Analogie which ought to be vsed in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Responsarie: But the Beare-bayting of Women, vnto which I haue framed my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeticall answere, beeing altogether without methode, irregular, without Grammaticall Concordance, and a promiscuous mingle mangle, it would admit no such order to bee obserued in the answering thereof, as a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Responsarie requireth.</p>
   <p>Wherfore (gentle Reader) fauorably cōsider, that as that Painter is not to be held vnskilfull, which hauing a deformed Obiect, makes the like portraiture; no more am I iustly to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for my immethodicall Apologie, sith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iudicious Reader may plainely see, that the Bayter of Women his pestiferous obtrectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like a Taylers Cushion, that is botcht to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

His absurdities therein contayned, are so many, that to answere them seuerally, were as friuolous a worke, as to make a Trappe for a Flea, and as tedious as the pursuite of an Arrow to an impotent man. Yet to preuent his hauing occasion to say, that I speake of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but can instance none, I haue thought it meete to present a few of them to his view, as followeth, that if Follie haue taken roote in him, he may seeke to extirpate it, and to blush at the sight of that fruit, which he hath already brought foorth; a fruite I call it (not vnfitly I hope) because a Crabbe may so be termed, as well as a good Apple. Thus, not doubting of the fauour of well affected, and of their kinde acceptance of my indeuours, of which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not applaud, but approbation: I rest,</p>
