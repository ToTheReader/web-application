First, that his soul be holpē, for if the soule be once holpen, then will the body be easily holpen afterward. Therfore, first to remedie the soule, is to exhort the sicke body to repentance, &amp; make him to vnderstand his sinne, teach him to call to God for helpe, and after that againe, to comfort and lift vp his fearefull conscience, and set foorth and paint vnto the sicke body liuely Christ, (which is the throne of grace) whereof we haue a fine example of king Ezekia, there did the Prophete Esaias vse this maner &amp; order with the sick king: war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him first to repentance, layd before him Gods iudgement, 2. Paral. 32. And as soone as he had humbled the king, &amp; called to God for grace, the Prophete then comforted him, and after that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied his bodily sicknesse. 4 Reg. 20. and Esaias. 38. Sirach also putteth vs in minde of like order, in his 38. Chapter. specially, that we in our sicknesse shuld confesse our sinnes, and amend, then to

Our Lorde God graunt you his grace, that ye may vse the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his prayse, and to the profite and commoditie of your neighbors. Amen.</p>
