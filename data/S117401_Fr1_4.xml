   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, my salutation shall be with a few aduertisements and requests vnto thee. First, whereas I often vse these phrases, <hi>The miracles of Antichrist, Antichristian miracles,</hi> or such like, my meaning is not, to giue vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ or his Ministers, power to doe wonders, which are <hi>in se</hi> and substance <hi>supernaturall:</hi> for those bee the <hi>Mirabilia,</hi> which <hi>Dominus solu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> facit; the Lord onely doth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 72. 28.</note> by his immediate power, vnto which all his creatures, and the <hi>nothing,</hi> out of which his creatures are made, are subiect by an obedientiall power or subjection: but I call the prodigies of Antichrist <hi>Miracles,</hi> because in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the seduced, they are such; and because sacred Scriptures, as Antiquity hath expounded and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doe so terme them.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I request thee, perusing my twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou passe not thy iudgement hastily thereon, vntill thou haue read the whole contents of the same, and then as thou shalt finde, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> iudge; whether I haue not, at lest very probably disputed, according to the sense of
<pb facs="8"/> our Sauiours prophesie, and Context of the Text; giue me leaue in this, <hi>Fungi vice Cotis,</hi> to whet the wits and pens of the more learned, to examine the <hi>secrets</hi> of that admirable prophesie of our Lord Iesus, which I there handle: <hi>Quicarpet mea edat sua.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, if in the prosecution of this argument, I do interlace some particulars, and vse some phrases which may seeme tart to the Aduersaries <hi>pallate,</hi> the Reader may not be iustly offended thereat: for they doe inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, so a buse all <hi>Reformed Clergies,</hi> &amp; Christian Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, with their calumnious imputations, that there is no end nor measure of their malice: and as for phrases, their pens &amp; mouths can hardly find any bad enough for vs. Againe, such is the nature of the argument, which I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in this Treatise, that it cannot bee well prosecuted without Tart termes to the Aduersaries taste. If any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Cleargy which are <hi>Siders</hi> to the Popes facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe distaste my matter or my <hi>stile,</hi> I shall no more regard their dislikes, then I will the barking of a currish whelpe. Such hypocrite-Clerkes what are they else, then the very <hi>Scumme</hi> of this Church, and the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which being, <hi>nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>her hot nor cold, God doth cast out</hi>
      <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 15.</note>
      <hi>of his mouth,</hi> and would God this Church had, or could spew them out.</p>
   <p>And heere I defire the Christian Reader to be aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, that such <hi>Conuerts</hi> as come from Rome (if sincere and conuerted in their soules) are sure to bee beset with diuerse sorts of Aduersaries: as the Papists and their <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the Semi-Brownists or fiery Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>cifianists, and their Fauourers, and to the hard censures of all such; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and sound <hi>Conuerts</hi> are certaine to be subiect: The first taxing them as not sound, because thēselues playing the hypocrites, and measuring others by their own lasts, doe hold them for like dissemblers: loth they are that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reputed learned or honest, should be thought to bee
<pb facs="8"/> sincerely, and in truth, conuerted to the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or to bee well esteemed of, or prouided for by the same.</p>
   <p>The other kinde, more vnkinde; taxe and reprooue such, because in their preachings and practises, they are firme and zealous for the maintenance of those articles (Christian and Apostolicall) Canons (Goodly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to which they haue subscribed. Ioyntly both sorts of them haue their eyes set so narrowly and incessantly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and their doings, that the least errour they may commit either in priuate conuersation, or by lapse of tongue (which as the Apostle deliuereth, no mortall <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 8.</note> man can perfectly rule or tame) shall be made a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but why write I this? to curry fauour, or to begge <hi>indulgence</hi> at any mans hands? <hi>Absit:</hi> no man without Arrogancie, can assume that of Christ to himselfe; <hi>Quis ex vobis &amp;c. Who of you can reprooue me of sinne?</hi> yet by the mercies of Christ, such sincere <hi>Conuerts,</hi> as England <note place="margin">Ioh. 8 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> hath of late had from Rome, dare in humility say; <hi>Quis</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 8 7.</note>
      <hi>ex Aduersarijs &amp;c. Which of their Auersaries can reprooue them of crime?</hi> If they can, wee say not to them in those words of Christ; apologizing for the adulterous woman in S. <hi>Iohn; He of you which is without sinne, let him cast the first stone:</hi> But we say confidently, haue our Aduersaries crime or not crime; let him, her, or them, cast peales of stones against vs, if they can iustly prooue that wee haue in any point whatsoeuer in doctrine or action, criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or semi-criminally transgressed against the Lawes of God, or against the lawes of this Church and Kingdom; let them not spare vs; wee onely desire that they would deale honourably; not come behinde and stabbe, for that is neither Knightly nor Gentle-man like, but let them accuse <hi>plena in Curia.</hi> Thus writing in the defence of sincere and honest Conuerts, my penne telleth mee, in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Factus sum insipiens &amp;c. I am</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>become foolish;</hi> I confesse it: but my Apologie shall bee the same, the which the Apostle vsed, <hi>Ipsime coegerunt, They</hi> (our Aduersarie,) <hi>haue compelled me:</hi> But why passe I not by the calumny? Because it toucheth the sincerity of our religion, which these by secret whisperings and surmises, seeke to staine and wound: and I verily thinke if in any kinde of calumnie, in this, that of <hi>Austin</hi> is most true, <hi>Qui negligit famam crudelis est: He who neglecteth his fame is cruell against himselfe.</hi> I hope then that wee shall not be reputed contentious, if wee call any to answer for their calumnies against vs, if they cease not to blemish the integrities of our Faith, wherein (I doubt not, but that I may speake the like of my brethren) I neuer knew what hypocrisie meant: no, no: wee leaue that for our Church Papists and Communion-Recusants, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that dish as due to such as ioyntly <hi>subscribe</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nie</hi> &amp;c. subscribe to obtaine a <hi>Cure,</hi> denie to peruert their Cure.</p>
   <p>As for our selues, who in the feare of God haue sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Iugum Exactoris, the yoake of the Exactour;</hi> wee <note place="margin">Isa. 9.</note> haue by Gods blessings a double staffe of comfort, the one firme as the euerlasting mountaines: Our faith and hope is that we are, <hi>Filij liberae Children of her that is free,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 22.</note> and <hi>Liberti Domini, Free-men of the Lord,</hi> which liberty the Lord Iesus hath graciously bestowed vpon vs: from <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 22.</note> whom we pray, and hope for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uch a good measure of his grace, that we shall not vse this liberty as an occasion of sinne; but liue more warily, by how much wee are hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in with Aduersaries on euery side, <hi>Sed ex his omnibus liberabit nos Deus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Another staffe or cause of comfort vnder God to such Conuerts as alreadie are come, or hereafter may happily come, may be, to thinke, that we haue a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> who doubtlesse doth from his very hart, embrace and loue those <hi>Conuerts</hi> which are in heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.
<pb facs="9"/> There are also of his Subiects both of highest and lowest ranke of all sorts (I meane such as are sincere Christian Protestants, and leane to neither side directly nor indirectly) who doubtlesse doe in their hearts loue vs, and are very glad when they haue occasion to doe, or heare of any good that is done vnto vs. What neede such then care if either <hi>Precisians</hi> on the one side, or <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> on the other, doe maligne them, <hi>Si Deus nobiscum; (&amp; Dij eius nobiscum) quis contra nos.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But seeing it pleaseth the Popishly affected, (I meane <hi>Church Papists,</hi> whether Laikes or Clerkes) to be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and so prone to censure vs late <hi>Conuerts;</hi> as vnsound, and yet in hearts Popish; I desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to giue me leaue to <hi>Character</hi> them out in a word or two in their right collours. What are they else then very <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> who desire to bring forth a forreine <hi>Monarchie</hi> (they care not what it be, so it be <hi>Papall)</hi> with the rent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of their mothers bowels. Like as the Dogges which haue arrowes sticking in their thighes, are neuer at quiet, till they, may haue shaken out the arrowes from their thighes; so they vntil they may shak off the present Church and <hi>State-gouernment,</hi> which like arrowes pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their remorsed consciences; they will neuer bee at rest; for this purpose though they frequent sometimes the Church, they will often withall haue secret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Ignatians &amp;c.</hi> I haue often heard <hi>Creswell</hi> and <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>sons</hi> (and if I mistake not, <hi>Parsons</hi> saith in effect as much in his <hi>Treatise for mitigation)</hi> affirme, that it would not haue beene good for our late <hi>Soueraigne</hi> by any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere statutes (as by enforcement to communion) to haue exasperated <hi>Church Papists;</hi> because (said they) the remorse and sting of their consciences against which they are compelled both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>communion;</hi> would when occasion might be offered, lead them <hi>praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pites</hi> into the ruine of the whole. Thus they. But what
<pb facs="10"/> toleration will worke, who seeth not? whenas gracious Conniuencie hath made them so insolent? yea then, there, and by those meanes it is to be thought they will proue most perfidious where, when, and by what meanes, they are most fauoured. Further I request the <hi>Reader,</hi> not to account this voluntary oblation of my <hi>Mite,</hi> into the <hi>box</hi> of Gods <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> as the effect of an arrogant desire to see my selfe oft in print. No, no; I consider the diligence of the <hi>Aduersaries,</hi> who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly clamorous with their pennes, <hi>against the Tents of the Lord;</hi> I consider the diligence of our <hi>Soueraigne</hi> who as the <hi>Imperator Augustus</hi> hath inuited both his Captaines and common Souldiers <hi>in praelium Domini;</hi> And although he hath performed his part so excellently that as <hi>Hircius</hi> affirmed of <hi>Caesar,</hi> for his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, his Maiesty seemeth rather to haue taken away then to haue giuen others occasion of writing; yet such seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be his Princely zeale that he prizeth as a Sacrifice any seruice done in this kinde; what if by his most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned penne <hi>Golias</hi> seeme <hi>prostratus?</hi> his <hi>Exuuiae</hi> to some seeme not taken from him, I meane the ragges of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and rotten superstitions.</p>
   <p>Thirdly I considered seriously <hi>tanquam Classicum Belli</hi> that <hi>Clangor</hi> of God, by the mouth of his holy Prophet: <hi>Put your selues in aray against Babilon, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 50. 14.</note>
      <hi>all ye that bend the bow, shote at her, spare no arrowes: for shee hath sinned against the Lord.</hi> If I amongst the rest of Gods Souldiers obey this his voice; and shoote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Babilon</hi> the best arrowes my simple arme can draw out of the <hi>Quiuer</hi> of Gods booke; with the bowe of his holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> this my diligence I hope shall not turne to my reproach; let them rather be reproached and reprooued, who tumbling as fat as brawnes within their <hi>sties,</hi> will not shoote out one arrow in Print, for feare of reproach; and lest they should bee put to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="10"/> what they shall commend to presse. And what? will they dare to deliuer any thing in <hi>Pulpit</hi> which they are afraid to commend to the <hi>Theater</hi> of the world? As the <hi>Presse</hi> is the worlds <hi>Stage,</hi> so is the <hi>Pulpit</hi> Gods <hi>Theater</hi> and a <hi>Stage</hi> for Angells. I see they feare with <hi>Arcesila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s,</hi> and are worthy to bee rewarded with him; but they haue the golden Arte of supplanting. For my part should I foreknow that this Treatise of mine which is <hi>sweete in my mouth</hi> might proue bitter in my stomacke and belly; yet out it should, my shoulders are of steele armed for all censures. But to all idle drones if neuer so elegant (who are ready with <hi>Bonamicus, Lazarus</hi> the <hi>Patauine</hi> to carpe at other mens labours) as <hi>Erasmus</hi> said to him, <hi>Lazare veni for as;</hi> so I to these <hi>Bon-amici Lazari venite for as, My good friends, and Lazars come yee out, shew your selues,</hi> or else, as your handes be tyed from writing, so let your tongues be tyed also from censuring: or else, be not discontent, if you bee reputed by some seuere Censurers like <hi>Esops</hi> Asse with head euer in manger and yet striking with his heeles. It is not inough to bestow a <hi>bimestrian</hi> Sermon and the same twice or thrice to bee said ouer, and then account your selues as worthy to be Censours ouer other mens labours: <hi>vaevobis,</hi> if liuing of the Gospell and hauing <hi>diuidents</hi> sufficient for two or three worthier then your selues, your tongues or pennes <hi>Euangelize</hi> no more nor better; no more of this, lest I bee twitted as I was once speaking for the free inlarging and increase of a free beneuolence &amp;c. What? this man comes lately from <hi>Rome,</hi> and shall hee teach vs, what wee are to giue &amp;c. But for my part I haue done, crauing pardon if I am ouerbold in this my free Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle▪ whereof the <hi>period</hi> shall be this: He that followeth Auarice cannot be innocent. Further in all sinceritie &amp; humility, I pray for the Church in generall, that such as halt betwixt God and <hi>Baal</hi> may bee remooued <hi>è castris</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
      <hi>Domini:</hi> And for my selfe in particular I humbly beseech our Lord Iesus that he would bee pleased so to assist me (who am the least of all his Familie) with the Graces of his blessed Spirit to the end, that I may neuer fall from that Grace in which now I stand. <hi>In fide viuo Iesu fily Dei. Amen.</hi>
