   <head>TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL SYR EDVVARD COOKE KNIGHT, His Maiesties Attorney generall:</head>
   <p>SYR, I had no sooner taken a sight of your last Booke, entituled: <hi>The fifth Part of Reportes</hi> (vvhich vvas some number of monethes after the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therof in England) but there entred vvith the reading, a certaine appetite of ansvvering the same, and this vpon different motiues, as vvell in regarde of your person and place, abilitie and other circumstances depending theron; as also of the subiect and argument it selfe, vvhich yovv handled, and manner held in handling therof, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he greatest preiudice, vvrong, and disgrace of Catholickes, and Catholicke religion that you could deuise.</p>
   <p>And first in your person and place, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your facultie and profession of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lavves of our Realme, your long standing, and speciall preferment therin, your experience, and iudgemēt gathered thereby, your estimation and credit in the Common-vvealth, and your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, honour, and riches ensuing thervpon; all


<pb facs="3"/>
vvhich drevv me to the greater consideration of your Booke, but principally your said profession of our <hi>Common temporall Municipall lawes,</hi> vvhich science aboue all other, <note place="margin">A strāge attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Princes lawes in Englād.</note> next to Diuinitie it selfe, doth confirme, and conuince vnto the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of an English-man, the truth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Roman religion. For so much as from our very first Christian Kings &amp; Queenes, vvhich must nedes be the origen, and beginning of all Christian common lavves in <hi>England,</hi> vnto the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, for the space of more then nyne hundred yeares, all our Princes and people being of one, and the selfe same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Roman religiō, their lavves must needes be presumed to haue byn conforme to their sense and iudgment in that behalfe, and our lavvyers to the lavves: so as novv to see an English tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lavvyer to come forth, and impugne the said Catholicke religion, by the antiquity of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-lavves, throughout the tymes and raignes of the said Kings, in fauour of Protestāts, Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Caluinistes, or other professors not knovvne in those dayes, is as great a nouelty and vvonder, as to see a Philosopher brought vp in <hi>Aristotles</hi> schole, to impugne <hi>Aristotle</hi> by <hi>Aristotles</hi> learning, in fauour of <hi>Petrus Ramus,</hi> or any other such nevv aduersary, or lately borne Antagonist: Or as to behold an ancient Phisitian, trayned vp in <hi>Galens</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
tents, to fight against <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Galenistes,</hi> out of their ovvne bul-vvarkes, or fortresses, yea and this in ayde of <hi>Paracelsians,</hi> or any other fresh crevv of <hi>Alchimian</hi> doctors vvhatsoeuer.</p>
   <p n="3">3. This first consideration then, of your person, place, and profession, did inuyte me strongly to come, and see vvhat you said in this behalfe, but no lesse did the argumēt or subiect of your booke, togeather vvith your māner of treating the same, of vvhich tvvo points I shall speake seuerally; for that they haue seuerall ponderations, &amp; all in my opinion both important, rare, and singular. For vvhat more important matter can be thought of among Christiās, <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>M. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> Plea.</note> then to treat of <hi>Spirituall Power,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ecclesiasticall Authority,</hi> being the kinges bench of Christ on earth, the table of his scepter, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of his dominion &amp; iurisdiction, vvhereof dependeth the vvhole direction of soules, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sinnes, the efficacy of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the lavvfulnes of all priesthoode and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, the gouernment of the vvhole Church, and finally the vigour, frute, &amp; effect of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion. This is the importance of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> and consider I pray you, vvhether it standeth vs not much in hand, to be attentiue vvhat you say, and hovv substantially you pleade in this matter.</p>
   <p n="4">4. And as for the other tvvo circumstances of


<pb facs="4"/>
rarenes, and singularity, vvhere may they more be seene, then in this so vveighty a case, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vvhole povver of the sonne of God, both in heauen, and earth, for so much as belongeth to remission of sinnes and gouernement of his earthly inheritance, vvhich is heere handled and ouer-ruled by a temporall lavvyer, and by him giuen to a temporall <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Queene</hi>; and this not only by force of a temporall Statute, made in Parlamēt to that effect, the first yeare of her raigne, vvhereby <hi>Ecclesiasticall Supremacy</hi> vvas ascribed vnto her, <note place="margin">The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of <hi>M. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</note> but by the very vigour of her temporall crovvne it self, vvithout any such Statute, and by vertue of the ancient pretended Common-lavves of our Realme, vvhich Common-lavves being made, receaued, introduced, and established by Catholicke Kings and Queenes, as hath byn said, maketh the matter so strange and rare, the vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; admiration so great, as neuer paradox, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the vvorld, seemed more rare &amp; singular in the eyes of Philosophers, then this in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of learned Deuines. And vvho then vvould not be allured vvith this singular nouelty to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch somvvhat after the depth of so nevv deuised a mystery?</p>
   <p n="5">5. After this ensueth, as considerable, your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, &amp; manner of handling this subiect, vvhich to me seemeth nothing vulgar, and consequently
