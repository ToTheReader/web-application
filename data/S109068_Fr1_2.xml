   <head>TO THE VAYNE-GLORIOVS, <hi>the Satyrist, Epigrammatist, and Humorist.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost worthy Triumuiri, no maruayle though ye mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle at my aduenterous boldnes, attempting beyōd your expectation, &amp; yet daring beyond my attempt, notwithstanding moued by the lines and letters of such iust Asses of Coram, as I knew you to be, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing ye had sate af a commission, <hi>ad Inquirendum de moribus,</hi> I endeuoured to doe you a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if it please you to accept of my endeuour: for seeing our liues by your worships censured, our maners by your censures controuled, our credit by your controlment impeached, I thought good to sollicite a <hi>Melius inquirendum,</hi> because yours, after some examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found false and forged, was at diuers and sundry sittings put downe in the house of office: for had ye gone forward with approbation, as ye began with presumption, ye would shortly haue proued as mischieuous to the Inhabitants of England, as Tyrone hath bene to the Frontiers of Ireland. For as Demosthenes sayd to the Citizens of Athens, An accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing slaunderer is an euill full of quarrellous sedition. It passeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of thought to conceyue, and the apprehension of conceyte to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the reach of your purpose: for the courses of you three in that imployment seeme as wonderfull, as the courses of all the starres in the firmament, because (by all likelyhood) ye intended to begin some newe Empire: for ye took vpon you to taxe all the world, like Augustus Cesar, making euery man subiect to your censure. Indeed this was a poynt of resolution, yet this resolution was not worth a poynt, because ayming at too great a purchase of glory, ye sustayned much losse of good will. For, after the boldnes of your speach had vncouered the baldnes of your conceyte, no body tooke greater pleasure, then to take displeasure against you. Notwithstanding, suppose you had as pregnant pates as Vlisses or Tullie, yet misimploying their faculties, ye will proue (as Plato rightly affirmeth) so much the more pernicious: so that it is better not to haue wit to imploy at all, then not to imploy well the wit we haue, because our want of wit we may oft impute to nature, but the abuse wholly rests in ourselues. I will thus argue therefore. He that wants discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is no more then a foole, and he that vseth none, is no lesse then an Asse, and he that is no more then a foole, is too bad to teach others,
<pb facs="3"/>
and hee that is no lesse then an Asse, others are too good to teach him.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding I haue not thought scorn to admonish you as friends by an Epistle, because I am bound to loue you as brethren, by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell▪ and sure I must needs commend you for one thing, and that is your magnanimious resolution, in vndertaking the censorship of this popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Common-wealth▪ wherein ye behaued your selues very vnpartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly▪ for ye neither spared the vitious for fauour, nor fauoured the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for enuie, but dealt so equally with all men in their penall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as though you had bene borne vnder the very <hi>Equinōctiall line.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Notwithstanding, I maruel you would enter into such a Labyrinth of busines with so little a thred of discretion▪ but you had nothing to do, and therefore would not be idle, as though idlenesse were, as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar take it, to do nothing▪ Nay, men are much deceyued in the nature of it: for <hi>Scaliger Exercit. 6 text 9. Cessatio ab actione, est quies, non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi> for he onely is said to be idle▪ <hi>Qui cum debet, &amp; potest agere, non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t,</hi> as Scaliger also saith.</p>
   <p>Well, my good Countriemen, yee know, <hi>Humanum est erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> and therefore offences should be borne withall, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries forgotten: why deale yee then more vnchristianly in reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our faults, then we inhumanely, in deseruing reprehension? It is ill to thinke of that which should be forgotten: worse, to speake of that which should not be thought: worst of all, to write of that which should not be spoken: <hi>Quod enim verbis palam fari non decet, scriptis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap> fieri non oportet.</hi> But what ye thought worthie of nothing, others thinke worth nothing, and therefore it is no great matter. To omit this, it is not long since that a friend of mine being merily disposed, told me for great newes, that there were three persons in the Realme, had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a notable peece of trauell, at their owne costs and charges. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, said I? Marry, quoth he, to discouer a whole Iland, and the maners of the people, bidding me ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se, who those three were. I, after a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>urre, thought (God forgiue me) that the one should be Sir Frauncis Drake, the other Sir Martin Frobysher, and the third Captaine Candish: but then the remembrance of their deaths, was the death of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: at last I told him, I could not tell, demaunding to what Countrie they were bound, and who might be their Pilote? Faith (quoth hee)
<pb facs="3"/>
their Pilote is better for iudgement, then euer Pontius Pilate was, and for experience the best in the world. The diuell as soone (quoth I.) At that he smiled (vnmasking the Iest) and told mee, it was the diuell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that had playd the Pilote, in guiding these three ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>els of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the <hi>Satyrist, Epigrammatist,</hi> and the <hi>Humorist,</hi> to discouer and lay open the infirmities of their Countrie men.</p>
   <p>But I feare I am ouerlargely troublesome, notwithstanding, sith I write with more affection of kindnesse, then affectation of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, I presume on your patience.</p>
   <p>Now a word with you alone friend <hi>Satyrist,</hi> for I may not forget you in any case: <hi>O mihi post nullos Satyrist, memorande sodales!</hi> By the Masse, &amp; yet that oath is vnlawfull▪ for sith the saying of the Masse is put downe, me thinks▪ the swearing of the Masse should not be tolerable: by yea and by nay therefore, you shew your Countriemen great discourtesie, for whereas you should salute them with an <hi>Aue,</hi> you threaten mee with <hi>A-uae.</hi> Thinke you that foule words can beget faire manners? If you do, I will not bate you an ace of an asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: for experience giues you the lie to your face.</p>
   <p>But your affection ouer-rules your reason, and therefore you are as sudden of passion in all matters, as an Interiection, and yet as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue in most cases, as an Heteroclite: you gathered vp mens vices, as though they had been Strawberries, and pickt away their vertues, as they had beene but the stalkes.</p>
   <p>They shall not make me beleeue, but that you were the diuels Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer, for there went not a lie abroad, but it was presently entertained of your eare: and euery sinne kept vnder writing, for feare lest the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell waxing almost sixe thousand yeeres of age, should faile in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and so chance to forget it.</p>
   <p>Beshrow my heart, if I thinke you not a very prompt and politike Gentleman: Prompt, wanting no words to expresse your anger: and politike, vsing much hypocrisie to conceale your malice.</p>
   <p>So that if a man should blazon you aright, hee must make your tongue passant: your anger rampant▪ and your malice couchant.</p>
   <p>As for you, <hi>Signior Epigrammatist,</hi> your head is troubled with such a rewme of conceit, as I know not whether to wish you a better head to contayne it, or a better heed to guide it. For (harke in mine eare a little) the rankest Raggamuffin, that euer swaggered in Shorditch,
<pb facs="4"/>
is not looser in his liuing, then you in your writing: but yet there is time to amend, for <hi>nunquam sero, si serio.</hi> I know you will note that, because its seruiceable for your purpose, but withall, <hi>Hic tibi pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. temporize not therefore too long. But what a Gods name meane you to negotiate in euery mans matter? Doubtlesse you were super-fantastically infatuated, when you skipt vp and downe from one estate to another, like a Squirrell on a tree, and snapt at euery man, as though he had bene a venison Pasty. <hi>O,</hi> ye were as busie as a Bee, and as angry as a Waspe, the heate of your colour euaporated her imagination, and the liberality of your tongue mayntained most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute lyes for the atchieuing of the whetstone. You made more recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Iest, then a scholler doth of a Maundy Thursday, or Cheshire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the New-found well, and yet when all come to all, was as blūt as a Hob nayle, which need not haue bene, sith (as I sayd) you might haue had the whetstone for lying. The whole Epigram doth nothing but make way for the two last lines, which are brought in like a piece of cheese and a manchet, to disgest all that went before. And verily you haue greatly troubled your selfe in naming certaine particular persons. Such a one you call Fabius, and another, Felix, anon comes me Rufus and Clodius, and such a company of Imaginarie persons and inuisible Ideas, to hold your worship talke, as would fat a man with laughter, or fill him with wonder. In the end, when your page hath playd the knaue with euery one a little, you turne ouer a new leafe, and cal for more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, with whom, lest any should suspect you to be no great scholler, you talke of the Intellectuall Quintessence, Genius, and such great secrets of Art wonderfull luxuriously. How your tongue rioted in bawdery, I am ashamed to rehearse, onely thus much I dare say, that if you had liued in the time of Ouid, he would haue giuen you his daughter to wife, conditionally for some instructions, when hee was writing DE ARTE AMANDI. For, touching examples of Venerie, I thinke, you had gotten a whole Sampler-full from Venus her selfe, so that you might well haue a place and applause aboue all others for that faculty: &amp; as you were in these things lasciuious, so you are in each thing friuolous, in some things ridiculous, in most things malitious, &amp; in all things vaine glorious. Now by your leaue. <hi>Monsieur Humorist,</hi> you that talke of mens humours and dispositions, as though you had bene a Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-setter
<pb facs="4"/>
seuen yeres in the firmament, or had cast account of euery mans natiuitie with the starres: but if I were as the Astronomers, I would call you into question for it, seeing you haue so abused their Art. But, had you bene but so meane a Philosopher, as haue knowne, that <hi>mores sequuntur humores,</hi> you would questionles haue made better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours▪ if it had bene but to better our maners, and not in stead of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall medicine, to haue giuen them a mortall poyson: but I consider of you, as of a yonger brother: you wanted this same <hi>multis nimium;</hi> and <hi>nulli satis,</hi> coyne (a goodyere of it) and therefore <hi>opus &amp; vsus</hi> put you to such a pinch, that you made sale of your Humours to the Theater, and there plaid Pee boh with the people in your humour, then out of your humour. I doe not blame you for this: for though you were guilty of many other things, yet I dare say, you were altogether without guilt at that time, notwithstanding I suppose you would ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e written for loue, and not for money: but I see you are one of those that if a man can finde in his purse to giue them presently, they can finde in their hearts to loue him euerlastingly: for now▪ adaies <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

To conclude therefore, if you demaund why my Epistle is so long, and my booke so short: I answere▪ The first is for your credit, to shew that you are no barren subiect: and the other, for my owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that I might buckle the better with you. My reason is intailed to the ground of this Axiome, <hi>Vis vnita fortior:</hi> for a man giues a sorer blow with his closed fist, then with his open hand: Whence I suppose the fist was called, <hi>Pugnus</hi> of <hi>Pugno,</hi> to fight, as fittest for blowes, and the palme, <hi>Palma,</hi> because the Palme is an Embleme of victorie and peace. Moreouer, in doing much, it is hard to doe well, and in doing well, hard to doe much: for the difficultie of an action consists in doing wel, in doing much, or in doing often. <hi>Nam agere recte, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
