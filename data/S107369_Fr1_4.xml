                 <title>A iustification of the Church of England : Demonstrating it to be a true Church of God, affording all sufficient meanes to saluation. Or, a countercharme against the Romish enchantments, that labour to bewitch the people, with opinion of necessity to be subiect to the Pop of Rome. Wherein is briefly shewed the pith and marrow of the principall bookes written by both sides, touching this matter: with marginall reference to the chapters and sections, where the points are handled more at large to the great ease and satisfaction of the reader.

      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare Christian Reader whatsoeuer, or of what Religion soeuer thou art, if there be any of these three things truly rooted in thy heart, either the care of Gods Glory, or the saluation of thy soule, or the loue of thy Country, with the peace, strength, happinesse, and flourishing estate thereof (as I hope all these three are conioyned in thee) by them, all of them, or any of them, I humbly and heartily entreat thee, to reade, not with prejudice, but with an honest and good heart, with indifferency, patience, aduisednesse, and with continuall waighing; considering, and examining, the things which I haue with great labour and diligence gathered, and heere set before thee.<note place="margin">Rom 9.1. &amp;c.</note> I doe protest before God (as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> did for the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>) that I haue great heauinesse and continuall sorrow in my heart, for my deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>English</hi> people, that are seduced and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen from the sincerity of the Gospell: and my hearts desire and praier to God is (and my endeuours both by example of life, and holy doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.1. &amp;c.</note> continually tend that way) that they might be saued (eternally, and in this world liue comfortably and happily.) For I beare them record (the greatest number of them) that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb facs="7"/> And it may bee, many of their seducers are themselues first seduced by the cunning of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Rabbines,</hi> who yet (the most of them) know full well, (and very often confesse in their writings, as I shall manifestly shew in handling the chiefe points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted betwixt vs) that Protestants hold the truth, and themselues haue swarned from pure Antiquity.</p>
   <p>In tender commiseration therefore, and yerning bowels of compassion vnto the seduced, I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this great labour, with neglect of my selfe, my health, and state, to doe good to their soules, and good to my Country, by vniting them (so far as in me lyeth) firmely to be the true Church of Christ, and the body of this State. And I haue caried my selfe with that sincerity and singlenesse of heart, that I may safely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test againe with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> I speake the truth in Christ, I lie not,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.1. &amp;c.</note> my conscience bearing me witnesse in the holy Ghost I renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking (nor writing) in craftinesse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.2. &amp;. 2.17. &amp; 1.12.</note> nor handling the word of God (or diuine things) decitfully: but by manifestation of the truth, commending my selfe to euery mans conscience in the sight (and feare) of God.</p>
   <p>I am no Innouator, inventer, or fauourer of new things in Religion. I search for the old, and out of all kinde of Authors deduct allegations, authorities, consequences and reasons against the new. I cut off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant, needlesse, and endlesse questions, priuate opinions both of these and former ages: and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the necessary points of Religion agreed vpon by the Scriptures, Fathers, and moderne diuines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne true limits: I set downe the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall points agreed vpon betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and vs: and shew withall their vnnecessary additions and corruptions. I search how corruptions came into the
<pb facs="7"/> Church (as they will doe into all societies of Men in continuance of time) I shew how they were discouered, opposed, and reformation wished and sought for in all former ages: and by what power, policies, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they preuailed after Sathan was loosed. I finde and shew the out-cries of historians, and other learned men, Emperours, Princes, Clergy, and people, yea of their owne writers against them, all before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. And all this while, I shew the continuance of all necessary sauing doctrine in many other famous Churches beside the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yea and within that Church also a sufficient visible number of many hundred thousands farre and wide spread in Countries and Nations, and continewing till <hi>Luthers</hi> time, which refused the gouernment, errors, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Papacy, and taught the same substance of doctrine which Protestants now teach. Yea, the better part of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely the Papacy, and the faction that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it) held with great liberty the same most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary points of Faith which we doe, vntill by the Councell of Trent (which was not a free end generall Councell, but guided wholly by the Papall faction) that liberty was taken away, and the errors of the Papacy were imposed generally vpon all, vnder paine of <hi>Anathema,</hi> or depriuation of saluation.</p>
   <p>Vpon due search of these and many other things (which heere I deliuer vnto thee) in the Scriptures, Fathers, Histories, and all kinde of Authors of either Religion, I haue by the grace of God attained to that perfect knowledge and assurance of the <hi>Verity Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the Protestants doctrine to <hi>good life</hi> in this world, and <hi>eternall saluation</hi> in the world to come, that any mortall man can desire to
<pb facs="8"/> haue: and am as willing (if God haue so decreed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> expedient, and the times desire it) to suffer for it, as the holy Martyrs were for this same Religion in the Primitiue Church; not writing any thing in substance which I will not willingly seale with my blood. This is it (deare Christian Reader) which I present vnto thy view in this worke, being a Summe or Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many great volumnes written on both sides, vpon these points, and thus briefly deliuered for thy greater case in reading and perfecter iudging of Truth and Errour, Sincerity and Corruption, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Nouelty.</p>
   <p>To answer all the <hi>Romish</hi> bookes (lately come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in great numbers) punctually following their owne method, had beene an endlesse labour both to Writers and Readers: and therefore (for my part) I thought better to gather their principall motiues and reasons out of the chiefest of their bookes, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating them into seuerall Chapters, to giue them their full answer in their proper places; so answering many bookes in one. Among the store of all other Allegations, I haue most willingly and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Reader to the late Writers of our owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that especially for these Reasons:</p>
   <p>First, for the excellency of our Authors, surpassing others, both in multiplicity of reading, profundity of Iudgement, and sincerity of affection, in deliuering the truth. As we finde in our learned Bishops, <hi>Iewel, Abbots, Bilson, Morton, Vsher, Downham, Hall, White, Andrew, &amp;c.</hi> And our Doctors, <hi>Fulke, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, Whitakers, Field, Favour, White, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, &amp;c.</hi> And other Diuines, Master <hi>Foxe, Perkins, Hooker,</hi> and many other: whose worthy labours, I doe heartily commend to the diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="8"/> of our <hi>English</hi> men. The <hi>Romish</hi> affected, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know, that those <hi>English</hi> which haue fled from vs, and written on their side, haue in shew of wit and learning gone beyond, not onely all former, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Age: So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes most out of them in the points whereof they haue written: as <hi>Sanders, Allen, Stapleton, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore let no man contemne their owne Countreymens wits and learning: but acknowledge their worth, and make high account of their learned labours.</p>
   <p>Secondly, to shew that I bring no new thing of my selfe, but what is fully confirmed by our most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued writers: and that I also thankfully remember and honour them, <hi>Per quos profecerim.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, to shew the vnity of the Writers of our Church from the beginning of the Reformation to this time, contrary to the <hi>Romish</hi> slanders, which charge vs with continuall varying from our selues.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, to shew to our <hi>English</hi> men especially, where they may read in our learned <hi>English</hi> Writers more fully, of the points which I deliuer briefly; for their better instruction and satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, because my selfe am aged, and not fit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the encreasing weakenesse of my body and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, hereafter (if any flourishing busie wits list to oppose) to manage this cause, without much disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, and to my selfe: I thought good to alleadge many worthy Diuines now liuing, that they might take vpon them the defence of their owne writings by me alleadged, or impose it vpon others more able in body then my selfe.</p>
   <p>Further, I confesse, that it much troubled me, that I could not make my booke shorter, without either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it too obscure, and vn-intelligible: or else cutting
<pb facs="9"/> off much matter fit to giue the fuller satisfaction. For by this length of it, (I doubt) it will become tedious to many, to reade it thorow, and cary away the matter in their memory. But I haue helped this Inconuenience as much as I could, <hi>(1)</hi> by distinguishing the whole matter into Chapters, euery Chapter being (as it were) a seuerall Treatise by it selfe, which may be read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; without reference to the rest, And <hi>(2)</hi> by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Chapters (if they be long) into Sections, (and sometimes also the Sections into Subsections) and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphes (marked thus §) setting downe the summes of the Chapters and Sect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ons, in the beginning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: for the quicker finding or refinding of the matters therein contained; and the easier view and carrying away of the whole forme of the discourse.</p>
   <p>The Stile in Treatises of this nature is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Rhetoricall to please the eare, or as Sweet-meates to delight the Taste; but Scholasticall, Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Theological, that is, intelligible and significant to informe the vnderstanding, and conuict the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Which if it performe, It is all that I affect, or thou maiest in reason expect in such a worke. And now I leaue it to thy diligent reading and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, wishing thee often to commend both the Writer and Readers to God in thy prayers;</p>
