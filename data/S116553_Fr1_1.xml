and knowledge of gods worde. And so muche y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> rather because we se by experience, and also fele it in our selues, that the iust god is offended &amp; angrye wyth our synnes, and wyll not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyd w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> these troubles, miseryes and crosses that alredye he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon vs, but doeth doutles prepare and make readie many more and more greuouse. Our office therfore is to be dilygent and circumspecte for the people of God, and nowe the hande of god beynge stretched furthe, to admonysh the flocke committed vnto our charges in tyme, least they die, &amp; their bloud required at our handes. Certeyn I am y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> our sinnes be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> only cause, wher fore this moste iust god is offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, and certeyn we be that the only way and meanes to please

and quiet him again, is to leaue and wasshe away oure synnes. What the synnes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people be where with all god is thus offē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, you that haue y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ouersyght of theym, knowe: or ye oughte to knowe.

It is the duety of euerye good pastoure and curate, dilygently to searche and knowe what ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue is most mete to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; what vyce most to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> church y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

I wyl leaue therefore the vnknowen euils vnto me, to the shepeherd of euery parish, requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryng hym to marke the synnes of the people after-and by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation of gods word, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by too pondre the condytyon of his people, lest that he cause thē and do the same hym selfe, swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe a Camel, and be choked w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a flee: leape ouer a blocke, and stomble at a strawe. Before all things, se that the people know theyr commaundementes, and the workes thereof, appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto god in the fyrst table, that they honour no wrong nor false god, nor yet the true god, a wrong waye: but as he hath cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded hym selfe, in the olde Testamente, and the newe. And alsoo that they auoyde all suche synnes, faultes, and dyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedyence,
<pb facs="4"/>
as be contrary to the commaundementes of God, in the second table. And for a help vnto you, and also to the people in this behalfe, I haue set furth here the. xiii. Chapyter of S.

Most hartily prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing you, and also in gods name, and the kinges maiesties name commaunde you, that as many as serueth any cure w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>in this di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ocese, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> can not for lacke of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or excercise, teche nor prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che hym selfe too the people the lyke doctryne, that they doo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye Saterdaye and Sonne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daye, reade vntoo the people thys. xiij.

here set it furth, that the people may learne to knowe, loue, and fear the better the kinges Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and other suche magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as be by hym appoynted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the people. And all suche as God hath yeuen grace of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge vnto, in theyr sermons, shall oftentymes inculcate and perswade thys argumente and rule of obedience vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And the cause why, I haue written in this Chapiter, more then an other, and thinke it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expedyent to be now taught vntoo the people, is the greate and daungerous offences and synnes of the rycher sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and alsoo of the poore, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
