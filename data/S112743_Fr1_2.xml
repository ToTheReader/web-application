The Lord of Lords increase all honorable and godly vertues in you (that you may be as excellent a Magistrate in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale as your honourable and most wise father hath of long time been and stil is,) with prosperitie in this life, to his diuine pleasure, and after the course of this time ended, perpetuall ioy and felicitie.</p>
