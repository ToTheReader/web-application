For as they haue stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all writers on the head, so they haue by them againe beene wounded to the heart. This fruite I am sure springeth frō their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall carping. They weaken the painefull hande, they make dull the sharpe witt, they poyson the well affected, they sowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongst the learned, they seduce the simple.

<pb facs="10"/>
men all writers seeme too new or too old, too short or too long, too plaine or too obscure, too simple or too curious. They are alway aguish, for euery thing is bitter to their tast. And deadly sicke of a desperate consumption, for the more they eate, the leaner they are. If you tarie these mens lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and liking, your papers, will perhaps be eaten with rattes and mothes. Whereas you feare the censure and iudgment of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you do well, if thereby you be made warie in your woorke not weary of your enterprise. For they hauing seasoned their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with equitie, and their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with discretion, will passe ouer small faults with silence, and reproue greater slips with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie It is not vnknowen to them, that the wisest mā hath his wants, and the soundest writer his errors. Then you are not to feare the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt, which cannot iudge of your labours, nor to regarde the enuious, which will not like your endeuour, neither to shrinke for

the godly &amp; vertuous, which will accept your good wil. Behold all hinderāces are plucked vp by the roots: wherfore thē do you doubt wherfore do you quaile? what do you require? what do you seeke?
