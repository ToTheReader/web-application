      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, as my leasure would permit, I haue perused your Enchiridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The subiect is diuine, and considering our Sauiours precept, Matth. 6.33. the work is seasonable; why should you then suppresse it? Say not, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode is preposterous, the best affected looke more to the truth deliuered, then manner of deliuery: Or that it is too plaine, where men onely desire, that that which is shut, may be opened; what good doth the golden key, if it will not open? or what hurt doth the wooden key, if it do open? Or that it euer stood with your nature to be more obscure: the lawes of God and nature say, we are not our owne, but what we are, we are it to God and to his Church. Should I then in way of approbation speake of the author? I must say as <hi>Seneca, non quis, sed quid:</hi> or of the worke, because priuy to my selfe how insufficient all my sufficiencie is, no more but this; <hi>vino vendibili suspensa hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera,
