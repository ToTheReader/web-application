      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Idlenesse the daughter of destruction, is to be abandoned of all men, that loue to leade the life of good and honest members of a cōmon vvealth: so is it as conuenient that euery man yeeld account to his countrey of his Zeale and good vvil that he ought by duty to beare vnto the same, by some vertuous or Godly vvorke, for good example sake: In cōsideration vvhereof (Gentle reader) as vvell to profite my countrey (to my povver) as also to eschevve Idlenesse: I haue attempted this my second vvorke vnto the place of thy indifferent iudgement, not mistrusting, but thou vvilt as thankefully accept the same, as I haue vvillingly vouchsafed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovve my trauaile, to pleasure thy delite in reading hereof. And though it be escaped my handes, not altogether so vvel plained and pollished, as I purposed it should haue beene: Attribute I praye thee, the cause to the busie liues, that all my Lorde my Maisters men do leade in the seruice of our Soueraigne Lady, the Queenes Maiestie: Sith the protection of the Scottishe Queene vvas committed to my saide Lorde in charge, vvhose true and duetifull seruice therein, to his Prince both night and daie: as vvell by the trauaile of his Honours ovvne Person, as also all them that serue him: I doubte not but FAME hath tolde it to all the Princes in EVROPE and noble subiectes: as it vvere to bee a Mirrour to the rest, that shall serue in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of their Prince, from age to age, no litle to the encreasing of his honour, and all his: (vvhich God maintaine). And I, being one of the simplest of a hundreth in my Lordes house, yet notvvithstanding, as the order there is, I keepe my vvatche, and vvarde, as time appointeth it to mee: at the vvhich times, gentle reader, I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this together, faining that in my sleepe MORPHEVS tooke me to PLVTOS Kingdome in a Dreame: The vvhich deuice, I mistrust not, but thou shalt thincke vvell of: Notvvithstanding I knovve that the Papiste vvill gnashe his teeth at me: The vvanton Dames vvill scolde at mee: The Couetous vvorldlinges vvill disdaine mee. The vaine glorious personnes in Aucthoritie, vvill enuie mee: False accusers vvill abhorre mee, Traitours vvill vtterlye detest this my simple vvorke. Another sorte there is, vvhiche I namde not yet: As the Cobler, and ZOILVS: VVhose nature is to plaie hissing HIDRAS parte, reiecting the vertuous labours of paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full personnes, Lying Idle them selues like Buzzing Drones, deuouring vp the svveete trauaile of the busie Bees, (but for these I passe not.)

Beseeching thee once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine gentle Reader, that I maie reape at thy handes, but the revvard of my good vvill, vvhiche shall not onelie content my trauaile: But also binde mee another time, to present some other noueltie, more fitter to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
