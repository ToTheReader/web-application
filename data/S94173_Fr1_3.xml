      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was with a holy admiration, and a religious and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified zeale, that the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prophet King <hi>David</hi> (contemplating on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Gods creatures, and meditating on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and dignitie which hee gaue man over them) Cryed out,
<note place="margin">Psal. 8.4.</note>
      <hi>O Lord, our God, how excellent is thy <pb facs="13"/>name in all the world, And what is man, that thou art so mindefull of him, and the Sonne of man that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitest him.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> (who was a liuely <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>) were rapt into this spirituall extasie of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and ioy, when he considered of Gods power and providence, in the workes of his creation; How much more infinitly and thankfully should wee poore miserable sinners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with true admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and admire with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy, at the vnspeakable and incomprehensible love of God towards mankinde;
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8. Col. 1.14.</note> In giving vp his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> to death; yea, to the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <pb facs="13"/>death of the <hi>Crosse</hi> for our redemption, and that he was so gracious a God, and so mercifull and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent a Father to vs, that he suffered his blessed <hi>Sonne</hi> to dye for vs,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note>
      <hi>That hee might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and purge vs, to be a peculiar people to himselfe.</hi> For, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sinners that we are; In <hi>Paradise,</hi> where our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gained their life, there (by their wilfull disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and transgression) they lost their righteousnes and we in them; because the foule staine and Leprosie of that their originall sin, hath successively and actually, made vs, their vnfortunate seede and posteritie, guilty both of Death and Hell; and <pb facs="14"/>there iustly adiudged <hi>to haue our Portions with the Devill and his Angels.</hi> But notwithstanding all this; God (yet) hath beene as mercifull to vs, as we have bene sinnefull to him; for although wee were lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> by
<hi>Nature,</hi> yet we are againe, both found and saved in <hi>Iesus Christ by grace;</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note>
      <hi>Who hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a ransome for all men;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Isai 53.4,5</note>
      <hi>Hath borne our infirmities, and carried away our sinnes and sorrows, by suffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee wounded for our transgressions, and broken for our iniquities.</hi> So that it is the present ioy of our hearts, and the future happinesse of our soules,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4,5.</note>
      <hi>That God, who is rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
      <pb facs="14"/>
      <note place="margin">Eph 2.4,5</note>
      <hi>(through the great loue wherewith he loved vs) when we were dead by our sins, hath quickned vs together in Iesus Christ, by whose grace we are saved.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And to the ende that all true <hi>Christians</hi> should not despaire of <hi>Christs</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vnto them nor so much give themselues over, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the reprobate sense and pleasures of sinne, or to the sugred insinuations and trecherous temptations of Satan, as any way to doubt of their salvation in the <hi>Lord:</hi> Why, this our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Lord &amp; Master, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> (the great Shepheard of his Flocke, and <hi>Saviour</hi> of his people) who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating his Divinitie <pb facs="15"/>with his humanitie) was wholly composed of loue &amp; mercy toward them. Hee, I say, a litle before his bloody, yet blessed death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Crosse) was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously pleased, to honour and sanctifie his Apostles, and, in them vs, who are of the true seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> with the holy Sacrament of his most blessed Supper, as a diuine pledge, and a firme &amp; authenticall confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his inestimable loue towards vs, and of his watchful care and vigilancy for our saluation; I meane for the full perfecting and accomplishing of our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Heaven with God his father:
<note place="margin">Rom 6.4.</note>
      <hi>That sin might haue no more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <pb facs="15"/>over ver vs; because we are now no longer vnder the Law, but vnder Grace;</hi> but that by the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and holy partaking thereof <hi>(In the imitation of Christ and his blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles)</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.6.</note>
      <hi>wee might be raysed vp together with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is therefore not our owne merits, but onely Gods mercies, not our own workes which are sinfull, but onely the blessed death and passion of Christ Iesus which is sacred, that must be, both the triumph, and glory of a Christian: And I confesse with ioy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Consolation, that this holy Sacrament of his <pb facs="16"/>most blessed Supper (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bread of his body was broken, and the wine of his blood powred out and shed, for the sinnes of all mankind) is the perfect pledge, the sacred seale, the full ransome, and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest mysterie of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Iesus Christ: And that as wee are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely cleansed and washed from our originall sinne, by the water of Baptisme, when wee enter into the State of Grace, in the Church militant heere on earth; That so by the blood of this Paschall Lambe, Christ Iesus (in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his blessed Supper) our sinnes are wholly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and washed away and <pb facs="16"/>consequently, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee shall enter into the state of glory, in the Church triumphant in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; So that fighting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banner of Christ his Crosse, and being spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually armed with these two sacred Sacraments, we may boldly beleeue, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently assure our selues, that neither Sathan, nor hell shall have power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against vs.</p>
   <p>And here (Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) before I proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this my Preface to thee; I give thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, That I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, with what a great world of different opinions and controversies this our little world of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <pb facs="17"/>is perplexed and troubled with, about this blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, betwixt the Protestant, and the Papist, &amp; especially about Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, the Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and communicating in one kind: In so much that an infinite number (yea too great a number) of pens, pulpits, and presses, are pittifully (because vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably) oppressed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: and that Christs blessed body in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (without pietie, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or charity) is daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacerated and torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with these contentions, whereas his owne Coate, (or vesture) was without peece or seame; So that our <pb facs="17"/>silly soules may well feare drowning, when the barke of our weake faith (masted and rigged with curiositie) sayleth in so dangerous and turbulent an Ocean, that hath neither bottome nor shoare; and which is daily and hourly tossed, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be split, and dashed in peeces, either with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering waves of levity and inconstancy, or with the boysterous winds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensd malice, or scandalous and erronious virulency: without looking vp to the true day-Starre of their hope, Iesus Christ; or to the Sunne of their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God; or without ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring or thinking, safely to arrive, and cast anchor <pb facs="18"/>in the Cape of good hope; Heaven. O that the spirit of Pietie, should (without piety) thus bee conuerted, and transformed into the spirit of Contention. And as for mee (who am the meanest, and most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of all Gods Seruants and Children) bingeniously confesse and acknowledge; that in some few languages I have read so many of these intemperate Contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, and vntimely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, that I am wearie of reading them; And yet so, That I rather pitie, then maligne, first their Authors for their sakes, and then them for their Authors sakes; and my witnesse is in heaven &amp; in mine own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, <pb facs="18"/>that with my heart &amp; soule I wish, that all these vnspirituall quarells might be composed in peace and amitie, and that these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate disputes and lynes might terminate in one, and the same Centre, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and that their learned Authors, (having their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity vanquished with the honour and glory of God) as Christian mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, might bee insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fast knit and vnited to their Head, and grand Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Iesus Christ: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause contention is not the way to heaven, and that God was found in the still and quiet, and not in the whirle and tempestuous winds; As also that where <pb facs="19"/>the great Lamps of learning and lights of the Church, contend &amp; fight about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, that there assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the weake ones, and the more illiterat Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe infinitly suffer in this quarell: That therefore (in the name and feare of God) they would please to take vp, and embrace this saying of the blessed Apostle
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14</note>
      <hi>Follow peace with all men, and also holynesse, without which no man shall see God:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the same purpose,
<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.15</note>
      <hi>Let vs fellow the truth in loue, and in all things grow vp in him, who is the Head, (to wit) Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To call our religion in questiÅ, is to doubt therof, and to halt betweene two <pb facs="19"/>opinions in matters of saith is <hi>(with the Luke-warme La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicean)</hi> to be of neither: I know wee are commanded by the Apostle, <hi>To make our election sure, and taught by the Prophet,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hosh. 4.14.</note>
      <hi>That the people who doe not vnderstand shall fall.</hi> I likewise know, that curiositie in matters of Faith and Religion is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and that for being too curious in prying into the sacred secrets of God, it is a fatall Rocke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some excellent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have suffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke wilfully, and a world of weake wits igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly. That Gods vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed mysteries and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses are as secret, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and as occult, and <pb facs="20"/>abstruse, as they are divine, and that wee are positively told, and taught by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<note place="margin">Isa. 40.28.</note>
      <hi>That there is no searching out of Gods vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;</hi> VVherefore as I envy no man for his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so (I prayse and blesse my Redeemer) I am not so wretchedly instructed in piety, as to deny mine to the world: much lesse to dare to desemble it to God: It shall suffice mee; that I had rather beleeue the truth, then quarell with it, and farre sooner (and with more alacritie and promptitude) to embrace and follow it, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or contest against it.</p>
   <p>As therefore wee cannot beleeue in God, before wee <pb facs="20"/>first know him; So wee cannot perfectly know this Sacrament of his blessed Supper, except we first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in it, and in the pure truth, and naked vertue and integritie thereof. I am not therefore of the vnion or communion of those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catholique Romanists, who are carnall, and not spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eaters of this blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and who tye their implicite faith onely to the bare letter, not to the true sense, and to the sight, not to the figure or commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which this heavenly mysterie infoldeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; VVho can dispense with their consciences (yea with their soules) rather to eat their God, then to obey <pb facs="21"/>him; and daily to teare his blessed body in peeces with them teach, as they doe hourly with their sinnes; and who rely on their own poore &amp; wretched merits, rather then on Christs rich promises, or on the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable treasor of his blessed death and passion, premised and prefigured vnto vs, in the bread and wine of his sacred Supper: But for my part; I really and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue, that Christs owne words, <hi>Take, eat, and drinke this in remembrance of me;</hi> doth make this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to bee a mysticall, not a corporall, a spirituall, and not a carnall sacrifice.</p>
   <p>But to leave Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <pb facs="21"/>and contention, to those who love them, (in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this divine doctrine of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper) and to come to that which more neerly and narrowly concearnes our edification to Christ, and sanctification by Christ; I ioyfully affirme, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre, That it hath bene a great part and degree of my earthly selicity, to have heard many excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and seene, and read many comfortable Tracts vpon this sacred Supper of the Lord, aswell on this side, as beyond the seas; and preached and written, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by the Samts of God abroad, as by our owne English Saints and Seruants <pb facs="22"/>of the Lord here at hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>And now (by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and mercy) mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very lately with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of that heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preached (on Easter day last) to the famous and flourishing assembly of the <pb facs="22"/>Protestants in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> (at <hi>Charenton</hi>) vpon these words of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (in the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his last Supper)

   <p>Consider wee againe, That as there is but one way forvs to come into the world, so that there are a thousand waies to go out of it. That we are subiect to as many diseases as sinnes; yea, and that diseases doe as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and as insensibly steale into our bodyes, as sinnes doe into our soules; That wee are never neerer death, then when we think our selues farthest from it, <pb facs="28"/>and that when we suppose our selues to be strongest in <hi>Nature,</hi> wee commonly are then weakest in <hi>Grace:</hi> As also, that a theeuish
<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume,</hi> a poore <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> a Cut-throat Squinancy, or a fierce and furious visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> doth many times (in a moment of time) violently snatch vs away from the world, and the world from vs, yea, and which is more to be admired, though no lesse to bee pittied, That some times, in the very twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye, we are choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a Fly, a Kernell of an apple, a crumm of bread, or a small Fish bone; Or else have our braynes dashd out with a fall, either from <pb facs="28"/>a Horse, or a staire. O (ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) how seriously ought we to ponder in our hearts, and how maturely and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously to consider in our soules, how extreame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is for vs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinate, and deferre: and (consequently) how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely necessary, &amp; expediÄt it is for vs frequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this blessed SacramÄt of the Lords Supper.</p>
   <p>Consider wee further,
<note place="margin">Iam 4.14.</note>
      <hi>That wee cannot tell what shall betyde vs to morrow, for that our life is but a Æ²apour, that appeareth for a smal time, and then vanisheth away.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.24</note>
      <hi>That all flesh is grasse, and all the glory of man, is as the flower of grasse, and that the grasse withereth, &amp; the flower <pb facs="29"/>thereof falleth away,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 13.14.</note>
      <hi>That we haue no abiding Citie heere, but must therefore seeke one to come, which is aboue: That as the tree falleth it lyes.</hi> That there is no sorrowing for our sins in the grave, and that after our death, there is no place nor hope left vs for a second repentance:

      <hi>And that it is a feare full thing to fall into the hands of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Armed in this manner with a lively faith towards God, and with periect love and Charity towards our neighbour, and having freed and cleared those sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spots of our hearts, and reformed and cleansed those foule affections and imperfections of our soules <pb facs="29"/>by our (vnfeigned) godly repentance and sorow; And having now assumed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp a firme resolution, <hi>ever hereafter,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eph. 5.10.</note>
      <hi>to approve and doe that which is pleasing to the Lord;</hi> And contracted a solemne Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and our souls,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.11.</note>
      <hi>never any more to have any fellowship with the workes of darkenesse, but reprove them,</hi> and not henceforth to dare to looke back (with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) on our forepast, deerest and darling sinnes, but with infinite hatred &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of them. Then, I say, let vs follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Apostle.
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.16.</note>
      <hi>Let vs goe vp boldly to the Throne of Grace, that wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy.</hi> Let vs goe <pb facs="30"/>boldly to this table; to this pretious banket of the Lords blessed Supper, and eat that sacred bread of his body, and drinke that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wine of his blood, in a strong Confidence and CÅmemoration, <hi>That Christ dyed for vs on the Altar of the Crosse,</hi> and for the free reconciliation, and full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and redemption of our sinnes.</p>
   <p>And having thus filled our hearts with sacred Ioy, and replenished our soules with spirituall and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gladnesse, by receining of this most blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we must then have an infinite watchfull eye over our hearts, and place a most strong and religious guard <pb facs="30"/>over our soules, that wee doe not hencefoorth once presume to hearken to sin, or so much as give way, or dare to consent to looke, or listen after the treacherous lures and temptations of the world, the flesh or the devill; and so to fall backe into a spirituall relapse of sinne, which is ten thousand times worse, and infinitly more dangerous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then that of any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall disease whatsoever, For it is a wofull, yea a wretched misery, which leaues vs no hope of better fortunes, nor place for worse,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22</note>
      <hi>If with the Dogge wee returne to our owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and with the Sow, that wee againe wallow in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <pb facs="31"/>mire of our former beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes and transgressions,</hi> For then our end will bee farre worse then our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<note place="margin">Hos 4.7.</note>
      <hi>Then God will change our glory into shame, And then wee shall make our selues guilty of the body and blood of Christ,</hi> (which without his all saving grace and mercy) is the high way to endlesse perdition, and the true way to eternall damnation. No, No, farre be such vngodly and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious thoughts from our hearts, and such vnspiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all treason against God from our soules; And let vs (who are the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ham</hi> by nature, and the Sonnes of God by Grace)
<note place="margin">Hos. 10.12</note>
      <hi>still breake vp the fallow <pb facs="31"/>ground of our hearts with a holy repentance and sorrow for our sinnes,</hi> and with a constant and inuiolable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution never to sinne more; and as (therefore) we have received Christ Jesus by faith,

<note place="margin">Collos. 2.6.</note>
      <hi>So let vs walke in him,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Thes. 1.11,</note>
      <hi>and walke worthy of him, who now calles vs to his Kingdome of glory,</hi> and, which is more, who in a spirituall Contract,

      <hi>hath vnited and maried vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in righteousnesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In which regard and consideration, because wee are so highly beloued of God, and so infinitly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the name of Christians (wherein wee ought more to insult, and triumph, then in all things
<pb facs="32"/>else which are vnder Christ) Let vs, I say, forsake the stincking garlicke and vnions of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (I meane our old beastly sinnes and transgressions) and for ever hencefoorth smell to the sweet Roses and Lilies of Heaven, (the delectable love, and promises of our Saviour Christ Iesus vnto vs) which are so sweetly watred with his pretious blood, and so odoriferously perfumed, not with fraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant odors, or costly spices of <hi>Arabia,</hi> but with the rich myrrh of Gods sacred mercy, and with the sweet and pretious frankincense of his divine fauour and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving countenande towards vs.
<note place="margin">Psal. 134.2</note>
      <hi>Let vs (I say) lift vp our <pb facs="32"/>hands to his holy Sanctuary, &amp; prayse the Lord,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier. 31.3.</note>
      <hi>for that he loves vs with an everlasting love,</hi> and that (by the blessed death and passion of his Sonne Christ)
<note place="margin">Psal. 68.20</note>
      <hi>hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our God, and the God that saveth vs,</hi> The which, If we religiously &amp; constantly performe;
<note place="margin">Ier. 31.12.</note>
      <hi>Then our soules shall bee as a watred Garden, and wee shall know no more sorrow:</hi> Then wee shall be as the
