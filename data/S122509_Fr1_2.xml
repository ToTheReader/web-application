   <p>As touching the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of our Church, <pb facs="3"/> I haue
answered your Iesuites Challenge by the Title of <hi>Via Tuta,</hi> the
Safe Way: wherein I haue appealed to the best learned of your owne side,
both for the Antiquitie of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Noueltie of your owne. If you
require further satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this point, read &amp; peruse the
<hi>Articles</hi> of our Church, &amp; tell me, without a preiudicate opinion,
if our Church was not Ancient &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible long before <hi>Luthers</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/> dayes. Our 22. Bookes of <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scripture, were they

<hi>Creeds,</hi>
      <note place="margin">The Apostles, Nicene, Athanatius

Our two Sacraments of <hi>Baptisme</hi>

Foundations of our Church, and all these in despight of malice it selfe,
must bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they are taught by vs, and
were vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally receiued long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes. And as
touching the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tenets of our Church (opposite to your
<hi>Trent</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> Creed,) our spirituall receiuing of Christ by
faith (onely,) whereby wee are made truely and really partakers of
<hi>Christs</hi> body crucified, is agreeable to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Confessions, and taught by all antiquitie before <hi>Luther.</hi> Our

      <note place="margin">Bell de ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bo Dei lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> Our Communion in both

      <note place="margin">Idem

which vvee sing, (and some of you blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously tearme

the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, as hee dresseth his Vine with his hooke, hath some piece
of</hi> Dauid <hi>in his mouth.</hi> These (I say) are the chiefe
principles of our Religion: these vvee holde vnder the <pb facs="6"/> Charter
of the great King; and all these by the testimonies of our aduersaries
themselues, were publikely known, and generally practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed long before
<hi>Luthers</hi> dayes. Doe you looke for an outvvard Forme of a glorious and
Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church in obscure ages? Doe you looke for <hi>A Citie vpon a
Hill</hi> in the darke night of errour and ignorance? I appeale to your ovvn
consciences; to vvhat purpose were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies <pb facs="7"/> of Christ
and his Apostles, that the Church <hi>should flie into the wildernesse,
and lie hid there?</hi> that <hi>Faith should not bee found on the
earth:</hi> that <hi>the time will come, when they will not suffer wholsome
doctrine, but shal be giuen to</hi> (Legends &amp;) <hi>fables?</hi> that
<hi>some should giue heed to the spirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and doctrine of
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills?</hi> that <hi>after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres Sathan should be let
loose, and deceiue the foure quarters of the earth?</hi> were all these
things <pb facs="7"/> foretold, that it might bee fulfilled what was spoken,
&amp; are the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres long since expired, and yet shall vve
thinke that none of these prophesies are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished?</p>
   <p>Admit the man of Sinne bee not reuealed, yet the <hi>Mysterie of
iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> began to vvorke in the Apostles time; and the Euangelist
tells vs, the tares vvhich the thiefe fovved in the night, had almost
choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the good corne; and <pb facs="8"/> lest there might be some
expectation of a great multitude, which shold assume the Title of an
eminent and glorious Church, our Sauiour himselfe by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, cals
his <hi>Church</hi> by the name of <hi>A little flocke,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luke. 12.32</note> as if a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were the ancient
Character of the true Church. The malignāt Church hath many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and
hypocrites, which indeed make a great noyse for a visible Church, <hi>when
as those <pb facs="8"/> wicked persons</hi> (saith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten) although
they seeme to bee in the Church,</hi>
      <note place="margin">August. de Bapt.
lib. 6. cap. 3.</note>
      <hi>yet they appertaine not to the true Church.</hi>
That <hi>many are called,</hi> is the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: that <hi>few are
cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> is the Church inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Neither doe vvee hereby make two
chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when we consider this Church after a two fold maner.<note place="margin">Bellar. de Eccles. li. 3. cap. 15.</note>
      <hi>In the Church
something is beleeued, some thing is seene; we see that company of men
which is the Church, but that this cōpany is the true Church, <pb facs="9"/> we
do not see it, but beleeue it:</hi> this is <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
confession, this is ours. Againe, looke back, and take a briefe Suruey of the
Church in seuerall ages. It began with two in Paradise; there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in
the flood but eight persons, &amp; in that number there vvas an accursed
<hi>Cham.</hi> In <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> not ten persons, nay scarce three
righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be found; there was but one <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi>
of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that entred the <pb facs="9"/> land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> In
the fiery trial, but three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, at the comming of <hi>Christ,</hi>
there was <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna, Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>Mary,
Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and not many more knowne to bee
sincere professours of Gods Trueth, in the Church of
<hi>Hierusalem.</hi> In the Colledge of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> there were
but twelue, and one was <hi>the sonne of perdition.</hi> In the time of
persecution for three hundred yeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Christ, Eusebius</hi> tels
<pb facs="10"/> vs,<note place="margin">Euseb lib. 8 cap 2.</note>
      <hi>the Church
was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed to the ground, and the Pastors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches hid
themselues heere &amp; there.</hi> In the ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for 300 yeeres
more, the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie so infected the Church, that <hi>the
ship of the Church was almost sunke,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hieron. ad
Lucif.</note> saith <hi>Hierome.</hi>) If therfore in the first and best
ages the Church was much darkned and obscured, what splendor and
visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility should we expect in these latter dayes, wherein the deuill is
let <pb facs="10"/> loose, <hi>seeking to deceiue if it were possible the
very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themselues.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let it suffice, as God himselfe first planted his church in
<hi>Eden</hi> with two; so he hath watred it in the <hi>Garden</hi> of his
<hi>Spouse,</hi> with the increase of many, best knowne vnto himselfe,
and hath promised a continuall preseruation of it, <hi>where two or three
are gathered together in his Name;</hi> and according to this Rule, (which our
aduersaries cannot deny) vve haue <pb facs="11"/> at this day, a Church in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West
Indies,</hi> in euery place where the Inquisition reigneth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the
outward face of the Church doe not visibly appeare.</p>
   <p>Your <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is too too visible in this
Kingdome, although you haue not toleration of publike Exercise, nor is your
Idol of the <hi>Masse</hi> set vp in the Temple, (which our good God, and
gracious King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) I speake not this in <pb facs="11"/> any sort to
decline the visibility of our <hi>Church;</hi> for the Church is like the
<hi>Moone,</hi> which hath often waxings &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and vvee know the
Moone at full, and and the Moone at the waine, is one and the same Moone,
although not alike conspicuous It was a <hi>Quaere</hi> in the dayes of
<hi>Salomon, Who can finde a vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?<note place="margin">August. de
Tempore. Serm 217.</note> but</hi> (saith <hi>Austen) in that hee said, who
can find her, shewed the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, not the impossibitie <pb facs="12"/>
of finding her: and this woman was the Church.</hi> He that made that
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, was the wisest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; and he that expoūded his meaning,
knew well how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the right wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet; yet
both agree in this, that the true <hi>Church</hi> was not easie to be
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tels vs, this <hi>woman tooke her flight into
the wildernesse,</hi> and there shee was fed. If the Apostle had
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the place as well as <pb facs="12"/> her flight, happily shee had
beene pursued and found of many; but the place vvas a desart, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and vnfrequented, and therfore known to few; and for certain she was found of
some, for otherwise shee had not bin fed. In vaine (I must
confesse) had <hi>Christ</hi> cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to <hi>tell the Church,</hi>
if there had been no <hi>Church</hi> to heare, and his <hi>precept</hi> had bin
need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to bid vs <hi>heare the Church,</hi> if there had been no Church
to speak; yet <pb facs="13"/> hee that warned vs to <hi>heare the Church,</hi>
forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs, that after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture <hi>Grieuous wolues would enter into
the church and speak peruerse things.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts
20.29.</note> He that taught his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to obserue to doe according to
all the Scribes and Pharisies should teach thē, enters this caue at
against their false glosses:<note place="margin">Math. 23.3</note>
      <hi>Beware of the leauen of the Pharisies.</hi> He that said, <hi>Blindnes
in part was hapned to Israel,</hi> told vs also, that the Church of Rome,
if <hi>she <pb facs="13"/> did not continue</hi> in her goodnes,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.22</note>
      <hi>shee should also be cut off.</hi> And
it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the same Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which the
Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> called the <hi>Citie of God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 48.19.</note> was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an <hi>Harlot</hi> by the
Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> in his time; and that <hi>Temple</hi> which
<hi>Solomon</hi> termed <hi>a House of Prayer</hi> in his dayes,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 8.20.</note> was afterward by <hi>Christ</hi> called
<hi>a den of theeues,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 21.14</note> the one
shewed what the Church was, the other how it was altered, yet both agree,
they were <pb facs="14"/> one &amp; the same church.</p>
   <p>The Christian church was neuer brought to a lower ebbe, then was
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Synagogue at the coming of Christ, &amp; yet a man at
that time might haue seen <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Zachary, Ioseph</hi> and
<hi>Mary, Anna</hi> &amp; <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the true seruāts of
<hi>Christ</hi> standing together with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in the same
Temple, which might wel be accounted as the house of Saints, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of
the one; so a den of theeues in respect of <pb facs="14"/> the other. If
therefore wee haue corrected the errours of the Romane church (as
<hi>Christ</hi> whipt the theeues and money changers out of the Tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) we
doe not hereby make a new Church, but renew that house of Prayer, and
restore it to the ancient and true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of <hi>Christ.</hi> If we had
left our Mother, when we first found her sick, shee might haue iustly
taxed vs of disobediēce, and want of dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; but when 
<pb facs="15"/> the <hi>Priest</hi> saw her, and passed by, when the
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite</hi> looked on her, and forsook her, <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Caluin</hi> perform'd the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the good <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> they
came neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and saw her, and tooke care to cure her wounded
soule; and frō that time her children became Physicians, to heale, not
parents to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a new Church. To heale a sore, to purge a sick and
diseased body, is not to make a new body, but to renew it, <pb facs="15"/>
and restore it to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health: let me giue you but one familiar
example of your owne in this latter age. Saint <hi>Francis</hi> established
the Order of <hi>Frāciscans,</hi> and they according to the meaning of their
first Founders, did for a long time follow the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their
first <hi>Orders:</hi> afterwards, when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine errors and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had
crept in amōg them, they separated themselues frō the rest, and were
called the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects.</hi>
      <pb facs="16"/> Vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a suit
was cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to decide whether the <hi>Recollects,</hi> or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franciscans</hi> did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the true orders of S. <hi>Frācis.</hi>
After exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp; deliberation had, the <hi>Recollects</hi> were found
to adhere to the ancient Institutions of their Order, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
Iudgement was published on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called
the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Franciscans.</hi> Such is the state of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med 
<pb facs="16"/> Churches at this day; the true <hi>Church</hi> was first
planted and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Christ and his Apostles; continued sound
in Head &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for many ages: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards whē error and
superstition had crept in, and gotten the vpper hand, there were certain
<hi>Recollects,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and errours, which
had sprūg vp in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church; wherupon after mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had
of the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <pb facs="17"/> of Christ and his Apostles, publication
was made in the behalf of the <hi>Recollects,</hi> that they were found to
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Christ and his Apostles, and from
and after that time they were called the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Will you bring a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> and examine for what
cause, and by what authority the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants haue reformed the errours of
your Church? I will tell you <pb facs="17"/> in briefe. If for no other cause,
yet for this alone, because you are taught to <hi>eate your God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mariana.</note> and <hi>kill your King,</hi> they might iustly
seeke a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in doctrine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: but the trueth is,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.1.</note>
      <hi>there were false Prophets gone out into
the world;</hi> and for that cause Christ gaue his commission <hi>to try
the spirits, whether they were of God;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they proceeded
to examination of the doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by Fathers, &amp; coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,

neither is it the name of Catholike, (which you wholly appropriate to your

<hi>Catholike Church,</hi> which is made the onely rule of Faith, is neither a
whole, nor yet a sound member of the Catholike and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Body. This
way therefore which you take, is a cloke &amp; colour to darken truth, by
