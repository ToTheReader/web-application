      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian and courteous Reader, how I was affected at the appearance of the blazing Star <note n="a" place="margin">Nov. 11. 1618.</note>; and with the Sermon of that stately tongue of Heaven, and shaking of that fiery Rod, God and mine owne conscience know. What I said of it in my next Lecture <note n="b" place="margin">In Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church Cant.</note> (being so iustly oceasioned by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of mine ordinary Text <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 2. 2.</note>) they that then heard me can testifie (whose memories I helped by reducing the effects, to these sixe words; Death, Drought, Dearth, Winds, Wonders, Warres.) How answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly things have fallen out, may lamentably be read in the face of Christendome: and how I have ever since endevoured (by handling of penitentiall Scriptures) to worke Repentance, the only way to prevent emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and imminent Iudgements, they can best witnesse, where (by Gods providence) I have exercised my ministery.</p>
   <p>Having lately, in divers Sermons, handled this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent portion of Scripture, out of the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 7. 16.</note> (one of those whom God extraordinarily raised after the Captivity of the tenne Tribes, and sent him to <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to reprove them for their

sinnes, exhort to repentance, admonish them to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the example of their brethren, else to threaten them with the like Captivity) howsoever they were delivered to many, yet me thought, the matter doth so fitly concerne these daies and times, as there arose a great conflict in my bosome, and I could not have peace till I was resolved, to communicate them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that (by Gods blessing) I might helpe to awaken moe out of security, and provoke them, by fasting and prayer, to make up the hedge and stand in the gap, for the Land, that he should not destroy it <note n="e" place="margin">Ezech. 22. 30.</note>. Thus, by Gods providence, these Sermons are come to thine eyes to read, who (it may bee) wast farre off when they were preached by word of mouth. Regard the matter, and be not offended at the manner, though simple, plaine and popular: a plaine iron Key may vnlocke the doore of a golden treasure; the evidence of the spirit is most seene in plainnesse <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note>; the Spiders web is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wrought, but unprofitable <note n="g" place="margin">

Ierom. ad Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot.</note>: though I had never so great leasure, I cannot study for words &amp; phrases: If I could, yet now I had no leasure; being often, thrice in one weeke, in the Pulpit <note n="i" place="margin">In Ch.

My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was, rather to worke upon the affections than the understanding; there being much more knowledge than devotion. Our forefathers disease, was ignorance; ours, impiety; they sicke in the braine; but we, at the heart: therefore I am briefe in the Doctrines, and larger in Vses, with Application and Exhortation.</p>
   <p>If it shall please thee to accept them kindly, read them devoutly, censure them charitably and lovingly,

correct such errours, as may have escaped Author, or Printer, being so farre asunder; I shall be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, to communicate some of my Lectures, wherein I have taken greater paines. But if thou shalt read, with a purpose to finde matter of dislike and reproofe, I shall forbeare to proceed any further in this kinde; a duty neither so directly commanded, nor hath the like blessing promised where it is performed, nor the like woe threatned where it is omitted; yet I friendly advise thee, reprehend not these, till thou hast publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed better of thine owne <note n="k" place="margin">Carpere vei noli nostra: vel ede tua.
