   <head>How to finde out the distance of degrees or Miles betweene two Citties, or any other Places.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have added scales of Miles to all the Tables, by which thou mayst easily finde out the distance of all places in this mannner.</p>
   <p>Take a paire of Compasses, and open them untill the <hi>2</hi> feete doe touch the extreame points of the places given, then appy them without any alteration to the scale of miles, and the numerall figures noted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will give the distance.</p>
   <p>But if the Distance of places doth exceede the length of the Scale, then with thy compasses thou shalt take the length of the Scale, and thou shalt turne the Compasses from one place to another, as farre as the distance of places will permit, and then reckon the miles together. But because the length of miles in all Countryes is unknowne, thou shalt more certainely take the distance of places with thy Compasses, and apply the Compasses without variation to the degrees of Latitude, which will give the true distance, by multiplying them by the Miles of the knowne Country.</p>
   <p>But the Miles doe differ much in divers Countries, and therefore I will here insert their difference in the chiefe Countryes.</p>
