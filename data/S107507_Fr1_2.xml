riers. There is a graunt giuen of a <hi>hiden Manna:</hi> but to such as <hi>fight,</hi> as <hi>fight law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> as <hi>ouercome.</hi> There is <hi>a blessing, a crowne, a crowne of life</hi> promised: but after <hi>tryall</hi> by temptatiō. Heauen is our Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, yet if we be not fedd with some <hi>consolation</hi> we runne hazard to faile in the way.</p>
   <p>This booke, a <hi>SPIRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVALL COMBAT; A TRYALL OF A FAITHFVLL SOVLE;</hi> or, <hi>A CONSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION IN TEMPTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION;</hi> (for which of the

three is most proper, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour makes doubt) seemes voluntarily and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to referre vnto all these. As it exhibites a <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITVALL COMBATE,</hi> we may learne the posture, the defense, the comportment of a Spirituall Combatant; in a word, to fight, to fight law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to ouercome, to beare away the hidden Manna. As it expresseth <hi>A TRYALL OF A FAITHFVLL SOVLE,</hi> we may discouer in it, our owne defectes, our disordered fighting, our weaknes, want
<pb facs="3"/>
of courage; thence endeuour to correct; to order; and as it conteynes <hi>CONSOLATION,</hi> to reuiue, solace, and reinforce our decaying courage. This is the whole scope &amp; end. And, <hi>MADAME,</hi> though I know, that what is here in precept, is your Honours in practise; nor can I doubt, but that your noble, obedient, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Daughters, knowing S. Iames his counsell, did then make prouision against temptation, when <hi>hearing</hi> the diuine inuitations, and <hi>seeing</hi> his goodnes, they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned</hi>

their eare to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall Councells, forgott their <hi>people,</hi> friends, fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, <hi>fathers Familie,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spouses to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King, who coueted their beautie, to walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the lilies of chastitie in the forsaken wayes of the Heauenly Hierusalem. Yet can I neuer thinke, that too much water can be brought to the extinguishing of so common a flame, or too much skill atchiued to fight with three so powrefull, and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemyes, the world, the

flesh, and the Diuell. Your Honour will voutchsafe to patronise this poore peece, and propose it to your pious childrens viewes. I will not dare so much to distract you in your more serious affaires, as to inuite you to become a spectatrix of this Battell, since there is in it no feate you alreadie know not, yet this I dare promis, that if leasure permit you to cast an eye vpon it, you shall not faile to draw comfort from it, while you speculate that in the aduise of a Pious and

A pen that had a designe to praise, could not but ioy to addresse vpon so rich a subiect, where the most flourishing rethoricke would fall short of a due expression: where nobilitie wonders to see it selfe gott to

Where, in fine, euen enuie it selfe finds not what to dispraise, with any specious show of truth. But what I cānot speake, my strife shall be not to spoyle. I would not my pronenesse to please, (not seconded with performance,) should offend the respect I beare, and homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge I desire to doe, to vertue in your Honour, which, I doubt not, will ingage some more able pen to register it in a
