   <p>I Was driuen into a quanda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether I might send this my Pamphlet to the Printer or to the ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. I thought it to bad for the presse, &amp; to good for the packe. But seing my folly in writing to be as great as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I was willing my fortune should be as ill as any mans. We commonly see the booke that at Christmas lyeth bound on the Stacioners stall, at Easter to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Haberdasshers shop, which sith it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of proceding, I am content this winter to haue my doings read for a toye, that in sommer they may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for trash. It is not straunge when as the greatest wonder lasteth but nyne dayes: That a newe worke should not endure but three monethes. Gentlemen vse bookes, as gentlewomen handle theyr slowres, who in the morning sticke them in their heads, and at night strawe them at their heeles. Cheries be fulsome when they be through rype, bicause they be plēty, &amp; bookes be stale when they be printed, in that they be common. In my mynde Printers and Taylors are bound chiefely to pray for Gentlemen, the one hath so many fantasies to print, the other such diuers fashions to make, that the pressing yron of the one is neuer out of the syre, nor the printing presse of the other any tyme lyeth still. But a fashion is but a dayes wearing, and a booke but an howres reading, which seeing it is so, I am of a sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers mynde, who careth not so the shooe hold the plucking on, and I, so my labours last the running ouer. He that commeth in print bicause he would be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, is lyke the foole that commeth into the market bicause he would be seene. I am not he that seeketh prayse for his labour, but pardon for his offēce, neither doe I set this foorth for any deuotion in print, but for

dutie whith I owe to my Patrone. If one write neuer so well, he cannot please all, and write he neuer so ill hee shall please some. Fine heads will pick a quarrell with me if all be not curious, and flatterers a thanke, if any thing be currant. But this is my mynde, let him that fyndeth fault amende it, and him that liketh it, vse it. Enuie braggeth but draweth no bloud, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious haue more mynde to quippe, then might to cut. I submit my selfe to the iudgement of the wise, and I little esteme the censure of fooles. The one will be satisfyed with reason, the other are to be aunswered with silēce. I know gentlemen wil fynde no fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, and beare with those that deserue blame, as for others I care not for their iestes, for I neuer ment to make them my Iudges.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
