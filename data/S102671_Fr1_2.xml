   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Honourable good Lord, these are to signifie vnto you, that whereas I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in print, many and sundry Bookes for the reading and vnderstanding of the sacred Scriptures, and my selfe being worne with age neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poynt of my pilgrimage, concluded with my selfe long since there to surcease: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
<pb facs="3"/> of late, my Lord, I was importuned for the new Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Booke, which almost twelue yeares since hath beene in request; whereunto I willingly yeelded, the rather vnder your Lo: fauour and protection, being my Honourable good neighbour, (although not worth nor worthy your reading.) For had it not beene anciently and truely said, that <hi>Hee is freer from blame that praiseth the dead, then he that praiseth the liuing,</hi> when the praiser cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with flattery, nor the praised with vaine-glory; then should I haue spoken of your Lo: more worthy deserts, and that whiles you are aliue, which I therefore must leaue to doe to the best learned in the Land when you are dead. And whereas also I
<pb facs="3"/> durst not so much as thinke my writing fit your graue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reading, I doe here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly acquaint your Lo: that the contents thereof is a kinde of Scripture Catechisme, by way of Questions and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, betweene the <hi>Pastor</hi> and the <hi>Parishioner,</hi> the one plainly and diuinely, the other a little Philosophically and plausibly, for the manner of handling. And so nothing doubting of your Lo: good acceptance, I humbly take my leaue, heartily desiring the Lord of eternall life, that by your good meanes, wee in these parts, and in your Iurisdiction, may haue a more peaceable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in our preaching, and that the sincere professors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may by you and such like, be more and more countenanced
<pb facs="4"/> and comforted, as your Lordship hath well and graciously begun, to the glory of God, to the sauing of many thousand soules, and to your owne heauenly happinesse.</p>
