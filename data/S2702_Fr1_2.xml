      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir (as you haue desired) I haue done all my endeauour to satisfie you with the truth of such note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy things, as in these parts happen; beeing recompenced by you with like for like from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, our naturall and beloued Citie. So it is (that beeing certified of a matter beyond all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason wonderfull) that at this instant is to be scene at the towne of Glabbich in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gulische neare vnto Colaine, from whence I departed not beleeuing the straunge report of many my good frends, till mine eyes had assured my heart, of that which mine eares coulde not perswade it vnto. And to be plaine with you, though I did see it, so admirable the report is, that I am doubtfull to deliuer it, least you should call my knowen credit in question, and count me a reporter of fabulous lyes.</p>
   <p>But to cleare my selfe of that supposition, I haue sent you the names and dwelling places of

diuers our countrymen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> that inhabite in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout London, who saw what I did see, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as I did, and will witnesse on their oathes the truth of what I write. Besides I haue sent you the Towne seale to a certificate of the truth, signed by the Magistrates, with the occasion, why it was gotten: and first will I name my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
