      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without a

neyther by spirite, neyther by

vndoubtedly did afore se by the

there should aryse false anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

shoulde worke great miracles

it were possible, the very elect &amp;

also shoulde saye, beholde here
is Christe, or there is Christe,
bringing in damnable sectes, &amp;
vtterly denyenge the Lord that

not here to be rehersed. And
woulde God, that as the name

If any man sitteth in the

take vpon thē the office of God,
<pb facs="7"/>
that is to remitte and forgeue
synne.<note place="margin">Esa. xi.</note> But they shall be slayne
with the breath of the Lordes
mouth. The order, which I wil
obserue in the treatise folowing
is this. Fyrst I wil proue with
manifest scriptures, that God
alone forgeueth sinne. Secōdli
that the Priest is but a minister
appoynted of God, to declare
fre remission of synnes to the
truly penitent, to declare, I say
and not to forgeue. Thirdly I
will aunswer to the obiections
of the aduersaries, and vtterly
wype them awaye, restorynge
