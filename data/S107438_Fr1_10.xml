      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entyll indifferent reder thou hast here before the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and decrees / whiche the moost famous and moste noble vniuersities of al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome haue with great consente, great iugement, and discretion, with great faith fulnes / and without any corruption, with great regarde / clerenes / and discharge of conscience made / and by theyr auctoritie
<pb facs="13"/>
confirmed vpon those leuitical lawes: by the whiche it is forbydden / that any man shulde marie the wyfe of his brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without chyldren / and we doubte nat / but these decrees and determinations ought of right and good reason to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued / both of the and also of all other / that be men of wysedome and discretion: and that be nothynge affectionate / but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. For suche men wyll be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente and satisfied alonely with the very truth it selfe / all though it be nat fortified with any wytnesse, nor sette forthe with pompe and plentie of reasons: so that suche men wolde nothinge doute / but that thynge oughte to be iudged as certayne and trewe / as possible may be / the whiche so many of the moost absolute / and moost wyse, and moost best sene men in all kynde of lernynge haue serched / beaten out / tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out, and in conclusion decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, with so great grauitie and sobre maner / with so great studie and diligence / and with suche leysour and deliberation. But parauenture there be some / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wyll lyttell be moued from their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion / that they haue ones taken / for all
<pb n="13" facs="13"/>
those decrees and verdites of so great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and wysemen / and for al the agrement and auctoritie of so many and so excellent vniuersities / but wyll thynke / that hit is necessarie to entre hygher and deper yet into the knowlege of the treuth / and wyll nat grounde and stablysshe theyr beleue but euen vpon the foundacions and groun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of very truth selfe / whiche they them selfe haue spyed and clerely perceyued / and nat vpon other mennes sentences and iudgementes. Therfore we haue iudged / that we shulde do a thynge worthe our labour / if we dyd gather in to one smalle boke certayne reasons and auctorities / by the whiche it might be plainly and openly declared / that ther were very weighty and ryghtfull reasons / whiche were able to brynge so many lerned men into this true opinion. And in doing our diligence in this matter / hit semed to vs conuenient to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, as a certayne rule and lyne / nat only the auctorities of holy scripture / of holy coūsailes and canons, and also of the most approued and resceyued doctours of the churche: but also the wytnesse of reason and nature / and to set before mens eies / as
<pb facs="14"/>
farre as scripture or reason, or fynallye nature semed vs to helpe, for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation of the iudgement and mynde of these foresayde lerned men. And if so be it gentil reder / these thynges, that we shall sey, shall not fully satisfye thy marueilous exact iudgement, and shal be sene not to be greatly necessarye, and to proue but smally this matter, that we go aboute: there shalbe no cause for all that, why thou shuldest esteme the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie determination, and moste hyghe wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and lernynge of these vniuersyties, by our power and smalle lernynge: but shalte for thy naturall gentilnes pardon our weaknesse and sklendernesse of wytte and lernynge, the whiche was not able to do no better / &amp; shalte loke for more weigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye and piththie reasons of the vnyuersy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties selues / whiche reasons as these vniuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sities haue them in a redynes and at hāde, so we doubte not, but of their humanitie and gentilnes they will gladly shew them to euery man, that will desyre them / and also shortly put them out openly to all the worlde. In the meane season, gentill indefferente reder, take in good worthe
<pb n="14" facs="14"/>
our studie / and faythful diligence, and this our labour and enterprise, and loke ouer these wrytinges (suche as they be) gladly and indyfferently. And let it not be payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto the good reder / yf we tary in any place in this worke somewhat longe: for bothe the diffycultie and hardnesse of this thynge, and the maner of our intent and pourpose dothe necessarely require, that we shulde touche eche one thynge som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what depely euen from the hede and very fountayne and begynnynge of hit. And farthermore, that we shulde declare and open all thynges some what at large and plentyfully, and that specyally in the fyfte chaptre of thys boke, wherby bothe the treuthe, playnely shewed, maye the more clerely be seen, and the errour, and false opynion of them, that be of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie syde, maye be the more easely percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And seinge, that this verdyte and iudgement of the Vnyuersytyes contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth chieffely two thynges / the whiche, as ye wolde saye / be the hyghe poyntes and heedes or issues of this determyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The fyrste, that hit is forbydden, bothe by the lawe of god / and also by the
<pb facs="15"/>
law of nature / that any christen mā shulde marie the wyfe of his brother dyeng with out children. The seconde / that the Pope hath nat power to dispence vpō any suche mariages / whether they be contracte all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy / orels yet to be contracte. It lyked vs here fyrste and formoste to loke vpon the lawe of god / that we might clerely se the glorious bryghtnes of the treuthe of our lorde. For trewly who so euer wyll dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently loke with suche eies / as he oughte vpon the lawe of god / puttyng of clene the coueryng of his flesshe and bloudde / with the desyres, affections, and lustes of the same / by the whiche a manne is blynded, that he can nat se the trewthe of god / he shall without doubte vnderstande / what thynges be of god, what thynges be of Christe, &amp; what thinges be of the spirite or goste. For truely the same lawe doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectely teache / what thynges so euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the feare and drede of god, what to the euermore enduring treuth / what to the euerlasting iustice of god / what to the power and vertue of god / what to the grace and fauour and to the free benefites of god / what to feyth, beleue, and truste / 
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>
what to knowlegynge of synne / what to holynesse / what to perfection / to rightnes / to equitie and conscience / to loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie / breuely / what thinges before god are taken for cleane or vncleane / fyled or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed / comely and acceptable / abhominable and cursed / holy and vnholy. All these thynges teacheth the sayde lawe of god. And the historie of Moses (concernynge the sacrament of matrimony) is after this maner and forme folowynge.</p>
