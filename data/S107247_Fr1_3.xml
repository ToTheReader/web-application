   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILIP DE COMMINES author of this present hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, was borne at Commines a towne in Flaunders, being a gentleman of a very ancient house, and ioined by blood and alliance to the best of that nation. His surname was <hi>Clytus,</hi> his father &amp; vncle had been both of them vnder D. <hi>Philip</hi> of Burgundy chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, of Flaunders called by <hi>Meyer, Summi pretores Flandriae;</hi> and to them he giueth this title: <hi>Domini Ruscurii, Buscurii &amp; VVatenenses:</hi> whereby appeereth of how great Nobilitie and goodly reuenewes <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> was, not onely in Flaunders, but also in Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault. In his youth, namely, from the nineteenth yeere of his age, and the yeere of our Lord 1464. till the 27. of his age, and the yeere 1472. he serued <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie, and afterward <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth of that name King of Fraunce, who emploied him in his weightiest and secretest affaires. He was of tall stature, faire complexion, and goodly personage. The French toong he spake perfectly and eloquently, the Italian, Duche, and Spanish reasonably well. He had read ouer verie diligently all histories written in French, especially of the Romaines, and bare them all in memorie. He much acquainted himselfe with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, thereby to increase his knowledge. He had great regard to the spending of his time, and abhorred all idlenes. He was of an excellent, yea an incredible memorie: for he often indited at one time to fower Secretaries, seuerall letters of waightie affaires appertaining to the state, with as great facilitie and readines, as if he had had but one matter in hand. A vertue so rare that I haue not read the like of any but of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> and him. Nothing more greeued him, than that in his youth he was not trained vp in the Latin toong, which his misfortune he often bewailed. After he was entered into the seruice of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> he was highly in his fauour, and during his raigne bare great sway in the realme. The said King also greatly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: for he made him first one of his priuy chamber, then of his priuy Counsell, Seneschall of Poictu, and Lord of Argenton. He married being of good yeeres a gentlewoman of the house of <hi>Montsoreau</hi> vpon the borders of Aniou, named <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> But after King <hi>Lewis</hi> his death, he fell into great troubles: for bicause he was a stranger, many enuied his prosperitie, so far foorth that at the length his enimies caused him to be imprisoned in the castle of Loches in the Duchie of Berry, (a place appointed onely for those that are attached of high treason) where he was verie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely handled, as himselfe in his historie reporteth. Notwithstanding his wife by earnest and continuall sute, in the end obtained so much fauour, that he was remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thence and brought to Paris: where when he had remained a certaine space, he was led to the parlament house to be arraigned. He had many enimies &amp; those migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of so great authoritie at that time in Fraunce, that for feare of them no Counsellor durst plead his cause: wherefore necessitie enforcing him to defend him
<pb facs="4"/>
selfe, he pleaded there by the space of two howers, being very attentiuely heard by the whole audience, and in the end so acquite himselfe, that by the Iudges sentence he was discharged. Among other things he rehearsed at the bar how sundrie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and daungerous voiages he had sustained for the King and the common wealth. How highly King <hi>Lewis</hi> both had fauoured him, and for his faithfull seruice rewarded him: for his owne part, he said that he neuer had done any thing couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ambitiouslie, nor cruelly: and further, that if he had sought onely to aduance and inrich himselfe, he might haue had as goodly possessions as any man in France. He was prisoner in almost three yeeres. The next yeere after his deliuerie he had a daughter borne named <hi>Iane,</hi> which married with <hi>Rene</hi> Earle of Pantabria descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Dukes of Britaine, by whom among diuers other children she had issue <hi>Iohn</hi> late Duke of Estampes, Lieutenant of Britain, Knight of the French Kings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Lord of diuers goodly Seniories. But to returne to <hi>Commines,</hi> in prosperity he gaue for his posie this sentence: <hi>He that will not labour let him not eate:</hi> but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie this, <hi>I sailed into the deepe of the sea, and a sudden tempest ouerwhelmed me.</hi> He died the threescore and fourth yeere of his age, the yeere of our Lord 1509. the 17. day of October, in his owne house of Argenton in the countrey of Poictu, from whence his body was conueighed to Paris, and there lieth buried in the Augustine Friers. I was heere purposed to haue staied my pen, and further not to haue spoken either of <hi>Commines</hi> historie or his life, had I not called to minde diuers accusations of <hi>Iacobus Meyerus,</hi> who in sundrie places of his Annales of Flanders inueigheth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bitterly as well against <hi>Commines</hi> life as his historie, whose accusations I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to laie open to the iudgement of the world, to the end it may appeere whether they be grounded vpon iust proofe. Notwithstanding before I enter into the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them, thus much in the commendation of <hi>Commines</hi> historie I cannot passe ouer in silence, that two of the greatest and woorthiest Princes that raigned in Europe these hundred yeeres; namely, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first King of Fraunce, made so great account of this historie, that the Emperor caried it continually about with him, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the workes of <hi>Homer,</hi> no lesse esteeming it than he did them, and the King was as much displeased with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and publishing thereof, as was the same <hi>Alexander</hi> in times past for the setting foorth of <hi>Aristotles</hi> workes called <hi>Acroamatica,</hi> as rehearseth <hi>Gellius:</hi> so desirous was he to haue reserued to himselfe and a few of his owne subiects the great treasures of wisedome hidden in this small volume. But let vs now heare what <hi>Meyer</hi> obiecteth against this historie. In the 17. booke of his Annales of Flaunders writing of the battell fought at Saintron betweene <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie and the Liegeois, he hath these words, <hi>Pugna commissa caeduntur magno numero &amp; profligantur, ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uem millia cecidisse tradit qui interfuit Philippus Cominius. Sed Brabantiae scriptor &amp; quidam scriptor Flandriae (quibus plus habeo fidei) tria tantum millia occubuisse memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> For answere heereunto, if this place be indifferently weighed it shall appeere to be wholie grounded vpon malice and no colour of reason, much lesse iust proofe: First, bicause <hi>Meyer</hi> preferreth the credit of these obscure Annalistes that write but vpon report, before the credit of him that was an eie witnesse, and that no way could aduantage himselfe by reporting a lye. Secondarily, sir <hi>Oliuer de la Marche,</hi> who liued also in that time and was Steward of the Duke of Burgundies house, writeth that a great number of these Liegeois were slaine at this battell, and also at the siege of Saintron, but that their friends and kinsfolkes trussed vp their dead bodies in vessels full of lime; partly to the end the discomfiture might appeere the lesse, and partlie that they might be buried among their auncestors, in the which feate (saith he) the Liegeois shewed a woonderfull audacitie and courage: whereby it shoulde
<pb facs="4"/>
seeme a great number to haue been thus trussed vp, by meanes whereof the dead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered the fewer, and were reported accordingly, which deceiued diuers, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie these Annalists of Brabant and Flaunders. The like practise we reade of in diuers authors, &amp; of the like writeth <hi>Meyer</hi> also himselfe. Lastly, the Annales of Burgundy agree with <hi>Commines,</hi> and report the number as he doth, so that this answer I hope shall suffice for this point. Againe, in the same booke fol. 364. <hi>Meyer</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Cominius de nobili quadam foemina attrebatensis ditionis proditrice patriae, cuius aedere non vult nomen, falsus in hoc vt in caeteris historicus.</hi> Sure if it were an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth that a Ladie of Artois could not send the King such aduertisement as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> reporteth that she did: or if <hi>Meyer</hi> were <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that <hi>ipse dixit</hi> might passe for proofe, the credit of <hi>Commines</hi> should happilie hang in ballance: but if you reade the place in his historie, the very circumstances will induce any indifferent man to thinke, that which is there written of this Ladie to be no lie. Againe fol. 366. <hi>Meyer</hi> hath these words, <hi>Hic est Cominius ille transfuga, gente Flandrus, qui multa de Carolo &amp; Lodouico prouinciali lingua bene scripsit, sed quaedam etiam scripsit plane men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciter, multaque dicenda infideliter reticuit.</hi> This is so generall and vncertaine a charge that answer in truth it deserueth none: notwithstanding, I refer to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those that shall reade this historie, whether <hi>Commines</hi> conceale his Masters faults therein or not (for that is <hi>Meyers</hi> meaning in this place.) True it is that he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them not in such railing barbarous termes as <hi>Meyer</hi> very vnseemely vseth of so great a Prince as King <hi>Lewis</hi> was, and is offended with <hi>Commines</hi> for not dooing the like, a thing which becommeth <hi>Meyer</hi> himselfe very ill, and would haue become <hi>Commines</hi> much woorse. But our author as he concealeth not his masters faults, but laieth them open enough to the vnderstanding of the wise and attentiue Reader: so deliuereth he them, so sparingly, and vnder such termes as truth being vttered, the Kings honor be no further impeached, than verie necessitie doth enforce; a matter verie commendable in a gentleman writing of a Prince, a seruant of his Master, and a subiect of his Soueraigne. Lastly, <hi>Meyer fol.</hi> 365. hath these words, <hi>refert Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius exercitum Caroliadeo fuisse extenuatum, vt exhibere illum Anglis non auderet, sed hoc falsum est.</hi> But you must beleeue <hi>Meyer</hi> vpon his word, other disproofe of <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> report he can bring none, neither grounded vpon any circumstance, nor produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of any good author that writ of those times. But on the contrary side for the cōfirmation of that which <hi>Commines</hi> writeth in this place, first <hi>La Marche</hi> reporteth that the bloodie fluxe entered into the Dukes campe lying before Nuz, which it is verie like consumed many, and impaired the health of many more. With him also agree the Annales of Burgundie, which report that the Duke lost 15000. men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nuz: which being well considered, and this withall, that the siege endured a whole yeere, and yet in the ende the Duke forced to depart frustrate of his purpose, whereby his soldiers had not onely their bodies tired, but also their mindes discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: I suppose no man of sounde iudgement will thinke that the Dukes armie could be otherwise than in verie poore estate. Now that you haue heard all that <hi>Meyer</hi> hath or can obiect against the credit of this historie (which also how substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he hath prooued I leaue to the iudgement of the wise and indifferent reader to consider:) it is good reason you should also heare what opinion other authors haue both of <hi>Commines</hi> and of his historie, and how honorable testimonie in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings they giue to them both. <hi>Annales Burgundiae lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pa.</hi> 930. speaking of <hi>Commines</hi> testifie thus of him. <hi>He was one of the wisest gentlemen of his time, and the best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all matters of state, as appeereth by his historie: whereof the Emperour</hi> Charles <hi>made so great account, that he neuer slept before he had read certaine chapters thereof, for the finishing of his daies worke.</hi> Which sure this noble and sage Emperor
<pb facs="5"/>
would neuer haue done, if <hi>Commines</hi> had been a reporter of lies, especially of the said Emperours owne great grandfather, whose life and death are so amplie in this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie treated of. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> giueth such credit to <hi>Commines,</hi> that al that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the history of France of the raigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. is onely an abridgment of him, &amp; wholy taken out of his writings. <hi>Ferron</hi> in his supply to <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie maketh in many places very honorable mention of <hi>Commines,</hi> highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him both for his great wisedome and vertue and sinceritie in his historie. <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uico Guicciardini</hi> no French man, but an Italian, in his description of the lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries fol. 220. calleth <hi>Commines</hi> a writer woorthie of great commendation. And fol. 310. and 311. thus he writeth. <hi>Of the Noble house of</hi> Commines <hi>was</hi> Philip de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <hi>Lord of Argenton, who wrote the historie of his owne time verie sincerely, he was a noble personage, of great enterprise, and of him diuers authors make honorable mention.</hi> Heere we haue the true testimonie of sundrie woorthie writers (for to vouche all were too tedious) on <hi>Commines</hi> behalfe, which ioined with the approbation of the noble Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, are sufficient, as I suppose, to maintaine his credit against the venemous dartes of <hi>Meyers</hi> sclanderous accusations. Now as touching <hi>Commines</hi> life, the onely thing that <hi>Meyer</hi> blameth therein, is his departure from the Duke of Burgundies seruice: for the which he inueigheth no lesse bitterly against his person, than before he did against his historie, for fol. 355. where he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke of Burgundies cruelty vsed at the castle of Nesle, which he tooke by assault the yeere 1472. he hath these wordes. <hi>Crudelis hic visus Corolus &amp; animo turbato, crediturque quosdam ex familiaribus parum habuisse fideles, ex quibus hand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie er at Philippus ille Cominius or tu Flandrus, Dominus Ruscurii, qui hoc anno transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git adregem, quisivir fuisset probus &amp; integer, nequaquam deserto Dominc suo, deserta &amp; abiurata patria ad talem transisset tyrannum, aliosque ad idem faciendum solicitasset, quantiscunque muneribus inuitatus.</hi> Againe fol. 366. thus he saith, <hi>Causam cur transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit aliisque nonnullis author fuerit idem faciendi non lego, cum autem Cominius in suis scriptis causam suae defectionis reticeat, non dubium puto quin ob faedum aliquod patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum scelus more proditorum aufugerit.</hi> Whereunto somewhat to answere in <hi>Commines</hi> behalfe, I say that what cause mooued him to leaue the Duke as we certainely know not, so is it not like that he departed from him for any heinous offence, bicause he was neuer charged with any, neither is <hi>Meyer</hi> able to produce any one testimonie (as euen himselfe in this place is forced to confesse) that he forsooke the Duke in any treacherous sort, neither is he able to prooue that he sollicited any to leaue the Dukes seruice during the Dukes life, though without all proofe most vniustly he charge him therewith. For if <hi>Commines</hi> had departed with the betraying of townes and castles to the enimy as <hi>de Cordes</hi> did; if for attempting to destroie the Dukes person, as <hi>Baldwine</hi> the Dukes base brother, and the Earle of Estampes his cosin did; if for both, as the Earle of Campobasso did, his offence could no more haue beene concealed, than the others aboue mentioned was. Wherefore as <hi>Meyer</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth that bicause <hi>Commines</hi> no where in his writings vttereth the cause of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it is like he departed for some hainous offence: so one the other side with much more reason it may be answered, that bicause neither <hi>Meyer</hi> nor any other Historiographer in their writings vtter the cause of his departure; like it is that he departed for no hainous offence, but onely for his owne aduancement or safetie or both, without seeking by traiterous practises to harme the Duke, as the aboue named with diuers others did. But let vs now examine what by all presumption was the cause of his departure from the Duke: and secondarily, whether his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from one Master to another being in hostilitie be excusable: which two points being throughly discussed, it shall plainly appeere to the world, whether he be iustly
<pb facs="5"/>
to be charged with any euill dealing, for leauing the Duke of Burgundie his first Master, and vnder whose dominion he was borne. As touching the first point, I am of opinion that <hi>Commines</hi> by his departure from the Duke of Burgundie, sought both his owne aduauncement and his safetie, the former whereof he had iust cause to hope for at King <hi>Lewis</hi> his hands, as a thing well deserued, at the Kings being at Peronne, where <hi>Commines</hi> wisedome and great credit with the Duke of Burgundie (as say the Annales of Burgundie) stood the King in so good stead, that by his onely meanes he was restored to his realme, libertie and life, which otherwise had beene in great danger, as by the course of this historie most plainly doth appeere. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Commines</hi> could not but assure himselfe of great aduauncement at King <hi>Lewis</hi> his hands, as well bicause of the Kings great liberalitie, as also for his owne desert: neither did his hope faile him, as the sequele well declared. On the other side at the Dukes hands no great aduauncement was to be looked for, both bicause the qualitie of his seruice to the Duke and the King was not alike, and so consequently the desert vnlike; and also bicause the Dukes liberalitie was inferior to the Kings, his attempts so impouerishing him, that he had not to be liberall of as the King had. Whereunto I adde, that he made no such account of his seruants as the King did, but attributed all his good successe to his owne braine, whereby their seruice was the lesse esteemed and the woorse rewarded, or rather not at all esteemed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: for he neuer vsed any mans counsell but his owne, so that wise men lost but their time with him. Yea <hi>Meyer</hi> himselfe reporteth him to be <hi>Durum, asperum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum, à quo milites maligne admodum stipendia accipiebant, raro blande &amp; liberaliter appellarentur, quanquam multis in locis extremis periculis se obiectarent, plurimumque algoris, inediae &amp; aestus sustinerent.</hi> If then the Duke were of this disposition towards his soldiers, and so euill rewarded them whose helpe he daily and howerly vsed: what reward could any wise man looke for at his hands, whose aduice he seldome asked and neuer followed? Further, the Duke was of nature very cholericke and ready to offer his seruants iniurie, as for example, to the Earle of Campobasso he gaue a blowe, which in the end cost him his life, and whether any such outrage offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our Author caused or furthered his departure we knowe not: but that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement (which was to be looked for at the Kings hands, and not to be hoped for at the Dukes) was one cause, is already, as I suppose, sufficiently prooued. The second cause of <hi>Commines</hi> departure from the Duke in mine opinion was safetie; for the Duke, as <hi>Commines</hi> himselfe reporteth, forced not to venture his seruants into any danger were it neuer so great, which all men (especially despairing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their seruice) will seeke to auoide: for as our Author himselfe saith in one place of his historie, most men by seruice seeke to aduaunce themselues, but all men will haue an eie to saue themselues. Further, <hi>Commines</hi> being a very wise man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sawe the Dukes attempts to be such, as would in the end ouerthrowe both himselfe, his subiects, and his dominions, wherefore he thought it best to dislodge in time and to saue one. These in mine opinion were the principall causes of his departure from the Duke, which being honest and reasonable, and his departure likewise voide of al treason and trecherous practises against the Duke: I see no reason why for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he should not rather be commended than condemned. The last point that we haue to consider is, whether he being the Dukes subiect might leaue his Master and depart to the King, were the causes of his departure neuer so reasonable and honest. Whereunto I answer, that <hi>Commines</hi> was not absolutely the Dukes subiect: for Flaunders was held in soueraigntie of the crowne of Fraunce, and both the Earle and all the people sworne to beare no armes against the King of Fraunce, and diuers
<pb facs="6"/>
examples too long to rehearse, are to be read in the histories of diuers Earles of Flaunders that haue been arrested, imprisoned, and togither with their people fined for breach of this oth. Wherefore seeing our author was a Flemming borne, and Flaunders held in Soueraigntie of the King of Fraunce, and the Duke of Burgundie in-hostilitie with the King of Fraunce, contrarie to the oth he either tooke or ought to haue taken; and further violating diuers, naie I may say all those points whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his allegeance he was bound to the French King: I see no reason why <hi>Commines</hi> might not, or rather ought not to leaue an inferior rebellious Lord, and cleaue to his soueraign Prince and King, to whom he ought a soueraign dutie both by allegeance and oth. And if after his reuolt, he gaue any aduice to the furtherance of the Kings affaires, he did therein in mine opinion the dutie of a faithfull seruant and true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Thus much I haue beene forced to speake in defence both of <hi>Commines</hi> life, and historie, whereof as the former appeereth to haue beene both honest and vertuous as well by the reasons aboue alleaged, as also by the notable discourses wherewith he farceth his historie, which breath nothing but vertue and sinceritie: so is the latter confirmed by the consent of diuers good histories, and approoued by the iudgement of the noblest Princes that Europe bred these many hundred yeers, as I trust is sufficiently declared. Wherefore our authors credit standeth vpright, as well for good conuersation of life, as sincere report in historie, both the which <hi>Meyer</hi> no lesse falsely slandereth, than he doth in other places of his Annales the noble races of the Kings of England and Fraunce, which ignorantly or maliciouslie he reporteth to be more vile and base than any honest eare can endure to heare. Thus hauing I trust sufficiently defended the credit of this woorthie writer, I will heere abruptly for auoiding of tediousnes staie my pen.</p>
