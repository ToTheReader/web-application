      <l>Where ayde appeares, to helpe the health of man,</l>
      <l>Where perfect proofe assignes vs what is best,</l>
      <l>Where counsell craues, eache willing minde to skan,</l>
      <l>Where learning lyes to helpe vs nowe and than:</l>
      <l>There best is deemde for man to spende his dayes,</l>
      <l>Though it be reapt with toyell ten thousande wayes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then blame not him, whose carefull hande first pende,</l>
      <l>This worthy worke, whiche nowe is brought to light,</l>
      <l>But it embrace, and double thankes him lende,</l>
      <l>Whose dayly toyle deserues the same by right:</l>
      <l>For vertue shines herein to eache mans sight.</l>
      <l>Whose ayde for health, with proofe and counsell graue,</l>
      <l>Whose learned liues, ought sure due prayse to haue.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Well: <hi>Rembert Dodoens,</hi> wrote this first in Douche.</l>
      <l>Whiche since in Frenche was turnde by others toyle.</l>
      <l>And nowe by <hi>Lyte:</hi> whose trauayle hath bene suche.</l>
      <l>For ease of all, within this natiue soyle.</l>
      <l>Where (loe) to <hi>Momus</hi> mates, he giues the foyle.</l>
      <l>And here presentes in the Englishe tongue,</l>
      <l>To comfort all that are both olde and young.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The worke it selfe, of sundrie trees intreate,</l>
      <l>Besides of Herbes, Flowers, Weedes, and Plantes that growes.</l>
      <l>Setts downe their vertues sure which are so great,</l>
      <l>That we may say therein great learning flowes.</l>
      <l>The Author hath (so farre foorth as he knowes</l>
      <l>By skilfull Iudgement) vnto eache disease,</l>
      <l>Set downe a cure, the sicke and sore to ease.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Great was his toyle, whiche first this worke dyd frame.</l>
      <l>And so was his, whiche ventred to translate it,</l>
      <l>For when he had full finisht all the same,</l>
      <l>He minded not to adde, nor to abate it.</l>
      <l>But what he founde, he ment whole to relate it.</l>
      <l>Till <hi>Rembert</hi> he, did sende additions store.</l>
      <l>For to augment <hi>Lytes</hi> trauell past before.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Whiche last supply so come to <hi>Lyte</hi> his hande,</l>
      <l>He fitly furnisht, euery peece in place.</l>
      <l>The worke agayne he wrote I vnderstande,</l>
      <l>For feare if ought therein shoulde breede disgrace.</l>
      <l>And did as much as one coulde in this case.</l>
      <l>For English names, to euery herbe and plant,</l>
      <l>He added hath, whereby is nothing skant.</l>
   </lg>

   <lg>
      <l>This rare deuice, eache one may well esteeme,</l>
      <l>Which bringeth ayde, and comfort vnto man.</l>
      <l>The learned wyll accept the same I deeme.</l>
      <l>Wherfore I craue yf ought espie thou can,</l>
      <l>(As none can be so watchfull nowe and than</l>
      <l>But faultes may scape, for want of <hi>Argus</hi> eyes.)</l>
      <l>To mende the same, and nought herein despise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>With willing minde, good Reader here I craue,</l>
      <l>Accept this worke, thus written for thy sake,</l>
      <l>And honor him that seekes mans health to saue.</l>
      <l>Yeelding him thankes, whiche it dyd vndertake:</l>
      <l>And vnto <hi>Lyte</hi> due thankes thou hast to make.</l>
      <l>His paynefull pen deserues thy good report.</l>
      <l>Whose toyle was great, to ende it in this sort.</l>
