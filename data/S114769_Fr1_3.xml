      <hi>To the Christian Reader, and</hi> especiallie to the inhabitantes of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhall</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> for <hi>whose cause chiefly this little</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme was written, grace, mercie, and peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter so many Catechismes of so many good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men had beene already published in our Church, if thou demaundest why nowe I doe aduenture the publishing of this of mine, as though I would seem to accuse them of some neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or want in that behalfe, or to ad vnto them: I aunswere, that my mind was free from any such purpose. But as they, in studie and care I do not doubt, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion and godlinesse, did take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie vnto themselues, in forme as they be extant, to frame and set foorth theirs, so haue I done. They haue written some largely, some briefly, and some haue kept a meane betweene long and short, and I haue laboured, if not to bee the briefest, yet to come as neere it as I might. They some haue quoted for confirmation in their margent, some haue omitted quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="5"/>and some haue prooues set forth at large by directions alphabeticall; as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them thought best, so haue they proceeded. I haue made proofe of euerie answere immediately vpon the answere, and almost made the wordes of the text the answere, hoping thereby the more to allure the reader and hearer. God make me partaker of my hope, and my godlie brethren of theirs. And thou (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) remember, in the bowels of Christ I beseech thee, that the more paines I &amp; my brethren bestow for thine instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by preaching &amp; writing, the more and greeuous shal be thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation if thou profit not by it, which thing would be our griefe. Consider what I say, &amp; the Lord giue thee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
