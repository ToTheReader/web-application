      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>East I fall vnder the <hi>Character</hi> of the vaine-glorious Man, in some opinions, by thrusting so much of my industrie in Print; I would all knew, how little fame I hope for, that way: when beside his, for, and to whom they are, I aym'd at no mans suffrage in the making; though I might praesume, that could not but please others, which I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented had pleased him. But, as it is the errour, and misfortune of young Children, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to stray, and loosing their dwellings be taken vp by strangers; and there lou'd and own'd: So these, by running abroad hauing got them false Parents; and some, that, to my face, would challenge them; I had beene a most vnnaturall Father, if I had not corrected such impudence, and by a publique declaration of them to be mine (when other meanes abandon'd me) acknowledg'd kind. This is all the glory I affected, to doe an act of Nature and Iustice. For their seale, they had it in the Mint, or not at all: Howsoeuer, if they want it, I will ease my selfe the vice of commendation.</p>
