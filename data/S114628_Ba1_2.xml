   <head>THE DREAME.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>ON the one and twenti'th day,</l>
      <l>Of the pleasant moneth of <hi>May,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>To a groue I did repare,</l>
      <l>All alone to take the aire;</l>
      <l>Sweete it was, and fresh, and greene,</l>
      <l>Decked like a <hi>Summer Queene:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Where abiding priuately,</l>
      <l>I did here fine melodie:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Philomel</hi> did chaunt and sing,</l>
      <l>Welcomming the cheerefull spring:</l>
      <l>Euery bird did straine her throate,</l>
      <l>Warbling out her pretie note.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Walking there a little space,</l>
      <l>At last I went with nimble trace,</l>
      <l>To a riuer somewhat neere,</l>
      <l>That had water pure and cleere:</l>
      <l>Fishes there did leape and play,</l>
      <l>Swannes did sing their roundelay.</l>
      <pb n="53" facs="32"/>
      <l> So I set me downe to rest,</l>
      <l>In a place that lik't me best;</l>
      <l>And beeing there a little while,</l>
      <l>Slumber did mine eies beguile,</l>
      <l>Till at last a sleepe did take me,</l>
      <l>That no noise till night could wake mee:</l>
      <l>The place was sure, and I was bold,</l>
      <l>The aire was pure, not hot nor cold:</l>
      <l>My pillowes were greene grasse and flowers,</l>
      <l>The willowes were my shadie bowres;</l>
      <l>My little dogge did so attend mee,</l>
      <l>That no creature could offend mee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In this sleepe (good Christian people,)</l>
      <l>I dreamed of a Church and steeple,</l>
      <l>Which at first my thought was bare,</l>
      <l>As many other ruines are,</l>
      <l>Weather-beaten and much worne,</l>
      <l>Rag'd, deformed, crackt, and torne,</l>
      <l>Without battlement or grace,</l>
      <l>Too too meane for such a place:</l>
      <l>For my thought this Church did stand,</l>
      <l>In best citie of this land,</l>
      <pb n="54" facs="33"/>
      <l> And for seate and eminence,</l>
      <l>Had the cheife preheminence:</l>
      <l>Wondrous great it was in sight,</l>
      <l>And of admirable height:</l>
      <l>King and people might it see,</l>
      <l>How it was in pouertie:</l>
      <l>And all strangers well might say,</l>
      <l>'Twere pittie it should so decay,</l>
      <l>Where Gods word is well regarded,</l>
      <l>And his Preachers are rewarded.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In this dreame (though fast I slept)</l>
      <l>Yet (with teares) I truely wept,</l>
      <l>And did pray that God would blesse,</l>
      <l>Such as would this Church redresse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>After teares were ouer-past,</l>
      <l>Ioy did visite me at last,</l>
      <l>For my thought this Church was mended,</l>
      <l>And the steeple was befriended.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Fashions many I did see,</l>
      <l>Er'e any fashion pleased me;</l>
      <l>One as before (a seemely spire)</l>
      <l>Which was burned downe with fire;</l>
      <pb n="55" facs="33"/>
      <l> One like <hi>Pulchres,</hi> one like <hi>Bowe,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>One like <hi>Boston</hi> was I trowe;</l>
      <l>One <hi>Grantham▪</hi> like I did espie,</l>
      <l>But his toppe stood not awry:</l>
      <l>And many other I did see,</l>
      <l>In this dreaming fantasie;</l>
      <l>But that which seemed to be best,</l>
      <l>Followes after all the rest,</l>
      <l>Which if your pleasure be to read,</l>
      <l>You'l say it was the best indeede.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>My thought the steeple was ta'ne downe,</l>
      <l>Lower then the Churches crowne,</l>
      <l>And suddenly was rais'd againe,</l>
      <l>With good labour not in vaine:</l>
      <l>Square it was as t'was before,</l>
      <l>Twelue foote higher t'was and more;</l>
      <l>Round the toppe a <hi>battlement,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Seemely, faire, and excellent;</l>
      <l>Aboue that <hi>battlement</hi> full high,</l>
      <l>Foure pinacles I did espie,</l>
      <l>Hollow, and of stone so sure,</l>
      <l>That till doomes day would endure:</l>
      <pb n="56" facs="34"/>
      <l> On the toppe of euery one,</l>
      <l>Was a little spire of stone,</l>
      <l>At the feete whereof there went,</l>
      <l>A little pretty <hi>battlement:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Round about these <hi>battlements</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Were fine <hi>phanes</hi> and <hi>ornaments,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>By whose motion without stay,</l>
      <l>Droue the crowes and kites away:</l>
      <l>In each <hi>phane</hi> was guilt the <hi>Coate</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Of <hi>benefactors</hi> of best note;</l>
      <l>And in a place conuenient,</l>
      <l>On th'inside of each battlement,</l>
      <l>A <hi>poesie</hi> thus was set in gold,</l>
      <l>As vnderneath you may behold;</l>
      <l>
         <hi>All glorie be to God on hie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>And to this Church prosperitie.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>These pinacles</hi> foure <hi>pictures</hi> had,</l>
      <l>Which to see did make me glad;</l>
      <l>That which stood next to the West,</l>
      <l>Had his face towards the East;</l>
      <l>Looking with maiesticke grace,</l>
      <l>For to see his Sauiours face;</l>
      <pb n="57" facs="34"/>
      <l> A <hi>King</hi> he was, a <hi>Crowne</hi> he wore,</l>
      <l>God blesse him now and euermore:</l>
      <l>For sure as <hi>London</hi> hath a <hi>Thames,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>It was the picture of <hi>King Iames:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>His <hi>Armes</hi> were in the highest phane,</l>
      <l>And then many noble man,</l>
      <l>Had their <hi>Armes</hi> vnder <hi>His,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Round that <hi>battlement</hi> I wisse:</l>
      <l>Like to <hi>spangles</hi> they did show,</l>
      <l>Vnto such as were below;</l>
      <l>And they that did to th'toppe resort,</l>
      <l>Might say it did belong to'th Court:</l>
      <l>His <hi>Kingly motto</hi> there was plac'd,</l>
      <l>Which the <hi>Pinacle</hi> most grac'd:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Euill come to illintenders,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Good to all true Faiths Defenders.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>THEN I lookt to that i'th <hi>East,</hi>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      </l>
      <l>Where a <hi>Bishop</hi> was at least,</l>
      <l>Opposite vnto the <hi>King,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Which to me much ioy did bring;</l>
      <l>In one hand he had a <hi>Booke,</hi>
      </l>
      <pb n="58" facs="35"/>
      <l> Wherein he seemed for to looke,</l>
      <l>In a sweete and reu'rend wise,</l>
      <l>Well beseeming such a guise:</l>
      <l>His other hand did touch <hi>his</hi> tongue,</l>
      <l>And a <hi>sentence</hi> thus he sung;</l>
      <l>
         <hi>To my Sauiour Ile be true,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>And this Church shall haue her due.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>On the toppe his <hi>Scutchion</hi> stood,</l>
      <l>Which to see it did mee good;</l>
      <l>Vnder that were all others,</l>
      <l>Which by calling were his <hi>brothers:</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This <hi>Pinacle</hi> did plainely show</l>
      <l>The <hi>reu'rend Bishops</hi> did it owe,</l>
      <l>And the <hi>Clergie</hi> with them ioynd,</l>
      <l>Because they would not be behind.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>THEN I saw towards the North, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
      </l>
      <l>Another <hi>pinacle</hi> of worth;</l>
      <l>Where was sitting in a <hi>chaire,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>One resembling a <hi>Lord Maior;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>The <hi>Cittie Armes</hi> were highest there,</l>
      <l>Vnder that all <hi>Citties</hi> were:</l>
      <pb n="59" facs="35"/>
      <l> A Shippe was carued there also,</l>
      <l>As if shee on the <hi>Sea</hi> did goe:</l>
      <l>Then a <hi>motto</hi> there was set,</l>
      <l>Which the Citie grace did get:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Walworth killed rebell Straw,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Cause he spurn'd gainst King and Law;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>So by our truth and industrie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>God makes our Citie multiply:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Let rebels swagger how they will,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>We will bee true and loyall still.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>This <hi>pinacle</hi> belongs to'th'Citie,</l>
      <l>The <hi>motto</hi> is more true then wittie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>THEN to the South I turn'd mine eie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      </l>
      <l>And in that Pinacle did spie</l>
      <l>A <hi>Country-man</hi> the plough to hold,</l>
      <l>A comely Farmer somewhat old,</l>
      <l>A <hi>Wheat-sheafe</hi> was his <hi>Armes</hi> I trowe;</l>
      <l>And the rest that stood belowe,</l>
      <l>Were implements of husbandrie,</l>
      <l>Set in the <hi>phanes</hi> most handsomely:</l>
      <l>And his <hi>motto</hi> thus was fram'd,</l>
      <pb n="68" facs="36"/>
      <l> As here vnderneath is nam'd:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Plaine I am as you may see,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Yet the Best growe rich by me.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>TVVIXT each <hi>Pinacle</hi> there was,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Pyramides</hi> that did surpasse,</l>
      <l>For beautie and for seemely forme,</l>
      <l>Strong enough for any storme.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In the middle of each square,</l>
      <l>There they stood and placed were.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>One had the picture of a <hi>Queene,</hi>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
      </l>
      <l>The fairest that mine eyes haue seene,</l>
      <l>Who surely as I'm honest man,</l>
      <l>Seem'd to be our <hi>Royall Anne:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>For it had such <hi>Maiestie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Ioyn'd with <hi>gentle clemencie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>That certainely it was the same,</l>
      <l>Which before I seem'd to name.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Her motto</hi> on the same was set,</l>
      <l>Which I neuer shall forget:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Faire without, and grace within,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Are beauties fit for Church and Queene.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And the poesie generall,</l>
      <pb n="69" facs="36"/>
      <l> Which I named first of all,</l>
      <l>That was placed in degree,</l>
      <l>As high as all the others be:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>All glorie be to God on high, &amp;c.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>THE second <hi>Pyramides</hi> had, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      </l>
      <l>The picture of a <hi>royall Lad,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Which I imagin'd euer since,</l>
      <l>Did resemble <hi>Charles</hi> our Prince,</l>
      <l>By each part of limme and feature,</l>
      <l>He did seeme a <hi>Kingly creature;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Stout and bold, gentle, free,</l>
      <l>And all that in good <hi>princes</hi> bee:</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>His motto</hi> now I will set forth,</l>
      <l>Cause it was a thing of worth:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>I scorne the feare of shedding blood,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>For God, for Church, for Countries good;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>But for all these Ile warre and fight,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>As Kings and Princes should by right:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>I will helpe the poore oppressed,</hi>
      </l>

      <l>At this delectable fashion,</l>

      <l>What would then the substance bee,</l>
      <l>Vnto him that may them see:</l>

      <l>For to see them in this measure.</l>

         <hi>Her motto</hi> now I will declare,</l>

         <hi>In the Churches wealth and peace,</hi>

      <l>Two other <hi>Pictures</hi> I espide,</l>
      <l>One of <hi>Denmarks royall King,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Whose fame with vs shall euer ring,</l>
      <l>And shall be linked in this knot,</l>

      <l>His <hi>motto</hi> was as doth ensue,</l>

      <l>BY him was Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Looking on <hi>his Valentine;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Each to other seem'd to glance,</l>
      <l>With a cheerefull countenance,</l>
      <l>In such an amiable sort,</l>
      <pb n="72" facs="38"/>
      <l> As my soule did therein sport;</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This <hi>Prince a Motto</hi> did vnfolde:</l>
      <l>Fit and worthie to be told:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Gods spouse and mine I will maintaine,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>So long as I do liue and raigne,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Turke, Pope, nor deuill, shall them fright,</hi>

      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>THEN in the middle of the <hi>square</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Where all these braue pictures were,</l>
      <l>There was rais'd (tenne foote higher)</l>
      <l>A <hi>curious</hi> and a <hi>costly spire:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And at the top thereof a <hi>Crosse</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Of Siluer guilt and not of drosse;</l>
      <l>Then a gallant cocke to showe,</l>
      <l>Which way still the wind did blow;</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In this place good <hi>Art</hi> was tride,</l>
      <l>How to make it sure abide,</l>
      <l>And accordingly t'was fram'd,</l>
      <l>That no workman could be blam'd;</l>
      <pb n="73" facs="38"/>
      <l> Not too weightie nor too light,</l>
      <l>Like <hi>Cheape-crosse</hi> it was in sight,</l>
      <l>But the <hi>pictures</hi> there that stood,</l>
      <l>Were of <hi>Princes</hi> that were good,</l>
      <l>That this <hi>Church</hi> did er'st aduance,</l>
      <l>And gaue it store of maintenance.</l>
      <l>And first the lowest placed there,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Henry were,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>One of proofe one of hope,</l>
      <l>Better <hi>Princes Heauens cope</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Euer had or euer can,</l>
      <l>Be better amongst the sonnes of man:</l>
      <l>Then betwixt them I espide,</l>
      <l>Two <hi>Princesses</hi> that lately di'd,</l>
      <l>Which looked like those of <hi>King Iames,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Gotten since <hi>hee</hi> dwelt by <hi>Thames.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And aboue in the next round,</l>
      <l>Other <hi>Princes</hi> there I found,</l>
      <l>Pictur'd all in their degree,</l>
      <l>As by time now dead they bee:</l>
      <l>There in letters of pure gold,</l>
      <l>Their right names I did behold;</l>
      <pb n="66" facs="39"/>
      <l> And I thinke in hollow brasse,</l>
      <l>Eu'ry <hi>picture</hi> shaped was.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This <hi>spire</hi> was hollow, and with lead</l>
      <l>Round about t'was couered;</l>
      <l>Fram'd with oken timber pure,</l>
      <l>Such as euer will endure:</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In that hollow was nought els,</l>
      <l>But a score of little bells,</l>
      <l>Which the <hi>Art</hi> of wittie times</l>
      <l>Made a delectable chymes:</l>
      <l>Who being high, their prettie sound</l>
      <l>Might be heard the Cittie round.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In the midst of th'upper loft,</l>
      <l>A paire of wodden stayres were wrought,</l>
      <l>And a doore at that stayres head,</l>
      <l>Which did bring mee to the lead;</l>
      <l>Where my thought I did behold,</l>
      <l>All that I before haue told.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>As about the leads I went,</l>
      <l>And saw all things so excellent,</l>
      <l>Looking ouer, I did see</l>
      <l>The <hi>Church</hi> likewise as it should be,</l>
      <pb n="67" facs="39"/>
      <l> With new <hi>battlements</hi> about,</l>
      <l>And walls mended throughout;</l>
      <l>All the windowes where need was,</l>
      <l>Were amended with pure glasse:</l>
      <l>Not any thing that wanted there,</l>
      <l>But was repaired eu'ry where,</l>
      <l>Neuer did I see a thing,</l>
      <l>Of more worth and reckoning▪</l>
      <l>Then this <hi>vision</hi> which I</l>
      <l>In my sleepe did plaine espie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Had I beene an <hi>Architect,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Dreaming of this faire prospect,</l>
      <l>Or with true tearmes could relate,</l>
      <l>All the fashion, forme, and state,</l>
      <l>Then might I say it taught mee more</l>
      <l>Then any practise did before;</l>
      <l>But many things of note and worth,</l>
      <l>I am not able to set forth.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>After long I had beheld</l>
      <l>The outward beautie it did yeld,</l>
      <l>Then I was vpon the pinne,</l>
      <l>To see what <hi>Grace</hi> it had within;</l>
      <pb n="68" facs="40"/>
      <l> Downe I went, (my thought in hast,)</l>
      <l>But my speede did proue in wast:</l>
      <l>For (to mee) it's griefe to tell;</l>
      <l>I was waked by a bell,</l>
      <l>And my dogge beganne to bay,</l>
      <l>At a frogge leapt crosse my way;</l>
      <l>By which meanes I did not see,</l>
      <l>How the same within might bee;</l>
      <l>And more worse (to ende my theame)</l>
      <l>It vexed mee t'was but a dreame;</l>
      <l>Well I wisht the Sexton hang'd,</l>
      <l>And my dogge I soundly bang'd:</l>
      <l>Yet to giue them both their right</l>
      <l>T'was time to goe for it was night;</l>
      <l>And I thinke my foolish curre</l>
      <l>Knew t'was fit for me to stirre:</l>
      <l>So away I runne in hast,</l>
      <l>And came safely home at last:</l>
      <l>Where with pen I did record</l>
      <l>All I dreamed word by word▪</l>
      <l>And I hope it's not amisse,</l>
      <l>To place it where it placed is.</l>
