   <p> That which slender iudgements call greatnesse, because themselues cannot compasse it, is not so, but a bumbast of titles and other shreds of fortune, wherwith the least mynds are often stuft out: But a mind well grown then best shewes it owne hight when it stands downe, and puts off the slippers of fortune. Heauen resist that this should euer befall your Lordships, because your vertues put them on, and they sit cleane on you: Yet when I sought first of what size I might make my respect, my imagination stript you of all honour till I found your worths so well set and limbd, that I could not make your estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too great. I shall bee much bound to your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehension, if out of all this circumlocution it extract this meaning, That not your fortunes but vertues begat my loue; so happily you will tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat the troublesomnesse of it for the parents sake: Yet I hope it wil not be altogether a fruitlesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="3"/>
for you to admit these plaine relations as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis in your more serious considerations. I held them belonging in some sort to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, many of these actions being performed by your noble vnckles, whose honours you are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, though without need. And though much hereof bee beyond your time, yet is it not beyond your knowledge, for hee whose vnderstanding is not elder than himselfe loseth the noblest inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his auncestors, and sticks in the worst kind of minoritie. You haue a most exact commentarie of your owne vpon this work, the all sufficient and most vnderstanding viscount <hi>Liste</hi> your noble vnckle, who hath scarce bin euer absent in any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice where honour hath bin present among them. Thus humbly dedicating my selfe and best labors to your gracious protection, I wish all honour and happinesse euer to attend you.</p>

      <signed>Vnchangeably remaining your Lordships humbly deuoted, W. SHVTE.</signed>
