   <head>To the neither Noble or Ignoble, Lord or Lady, kind or cruell, learned or ignorant, curteous or currish, Christian or Barbarian, Man or Woman, rich or poore: but to all and every one in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular.</head>
   <p>MOnsieur, and Madam <hi>Hydra,</hi> to your many Heads and varietie of Censures I have made bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a poore, harmelesse, modest, honest, and innocent <hi>Bawd</hi>; I know great persons of worth and Honour, are daily so visited with penurious shreds of <hi>Schollership,</hi> fragments of <hi>Hexameters</hi> and <hi>Pentameters,</hi> scraps of Poetry, the scum and dregs of wit, and the froth and lees of wisdome: One salutes my Lords Lordship at Breakfast with a Funerall <hi>Elegie,</hi> lamentably written, and is most miserably rewarded for his kindness. Another hunts out his VVorships ungentlemanly Knighthood, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving most intolerably be laboured his name with an <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicke</hi> or <hi>Anagram</hi>) which out of his vacuitie of worthinesse hee rewards with not a peny. A third hath belyed such a Lady or Gentlewomans Beautie and qualities, in most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable fashion, setting her forth for faire and vertuous; for the which hee is rewarded according to the subject he wrote of, and his owne demerits, with as much as comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For these and some other respects, I thought it not fit to desire the patronage of any one person in patticular,
<pb facs="3"/>
it being a subject that is common to all, for all, or any. At men are dispersed universally through the VVorld, so a <hi>Bawd,</hi> being an universall creature, whose function is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely scattered, I thought it not pertinent or accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that she should be privately protected by any. Therefore as she hath beene and is for al, so I dedicate her to all, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all are better able to reward the <hi>Poet,</hi> than one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. And this is further to advertise the Reader, that where I doe speake of Spirituall <hi>Bawdes, Bawdry, Adultery,</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> that I have avoided prophanitie, obscenity, scurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all manner of incivility or indecencie; not medling with Religion at all, but with a pitiful derision, and merry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, explaining the abuses, foppish and sottish corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that like so many Cankers or Caterpillers have and doe dayly eate, consume and putrifie both the Puritie and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of that Religion which boalts it selfe to be most <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Catholike.</hi> For the other part of this Booke, or <hi>Bawd,</hi> shee is altogether civill or temporall, being not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled so much as with one good Ecclesiastical word, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradoxicall; setting foorth the rare and singular vertues of a <hi>Bawd</hi>; wherein if any of my Readers can picke any pleasure, it is on apparant signe they have some wit, and if reape any profit, let them either thanke me in words, or else revvard me with silence.</p>
