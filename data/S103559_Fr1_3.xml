      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee reade of a certaine Philosopher called</hi> Egesias, <hi>who had so great dexteritie to describe the mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full face of this life, and such grace in setting forth the smyling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of death, as all men went ioy fully vnto it; yea, many (rauished with the loue thereof) did hasten their ends: Such Philosophie at this day were very seasonable if euer; these hideous Eclipses in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; these rainie cloudes in the ayre: this contagious poyson disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer all; that intestine alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which doth silently murmure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowele of Christendome; that thicke cloude of the East which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens bourely to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

houses; are so many defiances, which Death sends to mortall men, to summon them to the Combat. All men must vndergoe it, of necessitie, no man can free himselfe by flight; there is onely one remedie which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it selfe vnto vs, that speedily and without delay wee make a fayned Combat against death, to haue some happy presage of victory: As</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>the Great did, from a duell performed at pleasure, conceiuing that he should get the victory of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius; <hi>for that the souldier which acted his person did vanquish him of</hi> Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. <hi>In like sort let vs trie; at the least this triall will teach vs what wee can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>e, or rather what wee cannot; to the end that after the knowledge thereof, we may haue recourse to him who makes perfect his power in our weakenesse; to the Eternall, who alone can rescue vs out of the pawes of death. Hee will teach vs moreouer, how much many are to be blamed at this day, which liue in the light of the Sunne of Iustice, to bee so fearefull at the time of death, when as poore
<pb facs="6"/>
Pagans were so resolute.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But you will say vnto mee, What doctrine can wee expect from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans? by whom mans life is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed but ruined, as saith</hi> Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; <hi>and who are the Patriarkes of Heretickes, as</hi> Tertullian <hi>doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I answere, that if wee had put on Christ after the perfect stature of a Christian man, this labour were in vaine: But for this we may not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne all humane Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, but the truth which it hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, must be pulled away as from an vniust detayner, saith S.</hi> Augustine. <hi>Moreouer, long since the maximes of</hi> Aristotle <hi>and other Philosophers, were allowed in the schoole of Christ, namely, in that which concernes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, in which ranke natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death is Humane Philosophie in so much as she hath yeelded herselfe a seruant to diuine truth, hath not beene reiected but imbraced of the first &amp; most cleere sighted fathers; of</hi> Lactantius <hi>I say, who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Philosophie doth not hurt when as the spirit is seasoned with
<pb facs="7"/>
religion: Of</hi> Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>who saith learnedly, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Doctrine of our Sauiour be of it selfe sufficient, seeing it is the power and wisedome of God; yet by the doctrine of the Grecians, if it bee not more fortified, it is yet vnable to repell the insulting of Sophisters, and to discouer their ambushes; It is the bedge and rampar of the Lords vine. These great spirits, (saith he, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place) being free from passions, are accustomed to ayme point blanke and hit the marko of trueth: Thus he speakes, and therefore</hi> Lipsius <hi>did not forbeare to call it the meanes</hi>
      <note place="margin">Manud. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. c. 19.</note>
      <hi>and reconciler of diuine and humane Philosophie. To conclude; that great Diuine</hi> Nazianzene, <hi>as if hee had vndertaken the ouerthrow of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent obiection, teacheth that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine should not be basely esteemed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Orat. fune in Basil.</note>
      <hi>for that it seemeth so to some.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But wee must hold them sinister and impertinent Iudges, who desire to haue all men like vnto themselues, to the end they might hide themselues with the multitude, and auoide the
<pb facs="7"/>
censure of ignorance. Finally, wee confesse, that in the mysteries of Christ, he that will follow the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philosophers, shall stumble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. But the first death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treate, is no mysterie of Christ, but a thing as common as life: What Ensigne-bearer then shall we follow in this;</hi> Plato, <hi>or</hi> Aristotle; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      <note place="margin">Epist. 76.</note>
      <hi>must take in this point, is from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="8"/>
reason, by the which we exceede bruite beasts, and come neere vnto God: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>e might as well haue named the Euangelicall faith, the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>ation of reason, but hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not the name.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But before I conclude, I beseech you Gentlemen reade the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and then giue your censures; for as one Swallow makes no Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but many flying in diuerse pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at seuerall times; so if one reason shall not seeme sufficient vnto you, many ioyned together will chase away the apprehension of death. I meane not all apprehension, but the excesse; for it is the end of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which tends to no other end but to reduce the extreame feare of death, to a iust meane, and to sweeten the imaginary bitternesse: but wholly to pull this feare vp by the roote, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther possible nor profitable, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>nd that no man deceiue himselfe: It is not possible, for that man being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally subiect to passion, hee cannot disrobe himselfe vtterly of all passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but with his humanitie; it is the
<pb facs="8"/>
worke of death: why then should we feare it? seeing that by the benefit thereof we cast away all feare. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it profitable during this life; for, as</hi> Architas <hi>saith, Vertue springs from passions, and prooce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from them, dwels with them; euen as the best harmony is composed of a sharpe Superius and a graue base: euen so feare, like to other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, being reduced to a mediocritie, to the seate of true reason, is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into valour, a vertue most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in a man. Moreouer, a wise and vnderstanding man must not cast</hi>
      <note place="margin">Stobae. Serm. 1.</note>
      <hi>himselfe rashly into dangers; for hee cannot eclipse himselfe of this life, but to the great preiudice, (not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) but of the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Finally, I expect not herein to please all the world; I haue b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ene long of</hi> Solons <hi>minde, that in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importance it is a hard thing to please all men, but I will adde, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: On the other side I know that</hi> Momus <hi>the</hi> Cynick <hi>will shoote against this butte the blackest arrows
<pb facs="9"/>
of his enuie and disdayne: yet I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you Gentlemen, not to beleeue his saying, vntill that hee hath done better vpon this subiect; otherwise (as you know) he is not to bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his opposition. There are twelue houres in the day; if this Discourse be forced to hide it selfe at the first, it may be it will haue passage at the last: and admit it should not happen; that which one spake brauely, I will protest freely, It is enough if I haue few readers, enogh if one, &amp; enough if none at all: for in this matter the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which</hi> Seneca <hi>gaue to his friend</hi> Serenus, <hi>for a point of tranquillitie, pleaseth me, and I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ll depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What neede is there (saith hee) to compose bookes, which last whole</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. de tranquil. vir. c. 1.</note>
      <hi>ages? wilt thou breake thy braine that posteritie may speake of thee? Thou art borne to dye; funerals without pompe are not so full of trouble: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou doest compose any thing, let it be in a plaine stile, to imploy thine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>le time, and for thine owne vse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Euen so I haue ioyfully imployed
<pb facs="9"/>
my selfe, (according to my poore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie) to gather together the points of reason dispersed here and there, against the feare of Death; if it bee for no other then my selfe, yet my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour shall not be in vaine; and hauing done what I could, I shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But I had almost forgot to defend my selfe from the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>uectiue of some seuere Areopagite, to haue produced the strongest obiections of the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>rofane against the immortalitie of the soule: These are (hee will say) stinking irruptions of pestilent excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which should be buried in the bottomlesse pit of hell, and not infect the pure ayre of our Horizon: To thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> crimination I oppose foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for my iustification; the one is, that the ayre of our Horizon is not pure, but much infected with such contagion, hee that doth not feele it nor heare it: is a lepar and deafe. There is one hath written aboue 20. yeeres since, that impiety which before did but whisper in the eare, and mutter betwixt the teeth, presumed
<pb facs="10"/>
now to come into the Pulpit and to poure forth her blasphemies; and doe wee not see and heare in this age, (which is much impaired) that the most prophane are in most fauour and authoritie?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>In this latter plague at Paris, the chiefe Chirurgians of the Citie assembled in their Colledge, where they published by writing all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this malignant disease, and haue according to their Arte, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded counterpoysons to quench it; who will blame them? nay, who will not thanke them? The plague of the soules, the damned doctrine of her death, is propounded and refuted by sollide reasons, who will repine at it? The second is taken from the thing it selfe, which is, the immortalitie of the soule. Truth will not be flattered nor disguised, shee contents her selfe with her owne constancie, and her naturall Ornaments; shee is like the Palme tree which the more it is prest downe, the higher it growes: It is like gold, the more it is tried the brighter it shines.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>Hee that doubts of his cause likes not many questions; we doubt not of the immortality of the soule; the more she strikes against the stone of contention, the more the fire of her immortall extraction will appeare. The third reason comes from them that contradict the trueth; if you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them alwayes to braue it, in the end they will proclaime a triumph. It is not the part of a braue soldier, but of a coward, to suffer his enemy to keepe the field; he must chase him away, and vanquish him if it bee possible. Answere the foole accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his folly, saith the wise man, to the end, hee esteeme not himselfe wise.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Finally, the order of my disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath held me vnto it, the equall Law of duels binds mee to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all the attempts which my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie shall deuise to make against me; I entertayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

turnecoate and a perfidious dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of the cause: But it may be some consor will reply, You plant distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thornes in the hearts of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which heretofore dia flie ioyfully vpon the wings of the immortality of their soules.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>I answere, That to pull vp the thornes which Satan and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue planted, to resolue diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties propounded by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>
