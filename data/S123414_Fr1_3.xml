   <head>❧ The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering the great peace and quietnesse, wherewith God hath continually blessed this Noble Realme of England, since the time that it pleased him by the hand of her Maiestie to haue the sincere trueth of the Gospel of our Sauiour planted among vs, and his great blessings of all sortes, wherewith he hath enriched vs, and giuen vs our heartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to our comfort, and the admiration of our neighbours rounde about vs: It were too great impietie, not to shewe our selues dayly thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for these great mercies, and not to craue the continuance of Gods holy hand ouer vs. But weighing further, with what perill of violent death, by meanes of wicked popish practises, our gracious soueraigne hath mainteined the trueth, which we professe, vpon whose life (next vnder God) the profession of the same in this land, and the continuance of the liues and welfare of vs her faithfull Subiects, doe depend: and knowing that the Almightie most miraculously hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued her highnesse, from al treason hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against her most Royall person, and kept our blood from flowing in euery streete like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our Cities &amp; Houses from sacking, and the
<pb facs="3"/>whole Land from extreme ruine: with what zeale ought euery one of vs to be inflamed to prayse the Lord, for the detecting and confusion of our secrete foes, whō his right hand hath brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? and howe ought we to detest that doctrine which bringeth foorth so traiterous and bloodie fruites? <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> and the whole hoste of Israel had neuer greater cause to sing vnto the Lorde for the ouerthrowe of <hi>Pharao</hi> and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: nor <hi>Debora</hi> and <hi>Barac</hi> for the victorie of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera:</hi> nor <hi>Iudith,</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Bethulia</hi> for the end of <hi>Holofernes</hi> and the flight of his hoste, then we haue for the wonderfull preseruation of the life of our most gracious <hi>Queene,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for our owne safetie. Wherefore, let euery one that feareth the Lord among vs, not onely with the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the booke of <hi>Esther</hi> yeerely holde a memoriall with great ioy of so notable deliuerance, but dayly in common assemblies haue this great goodnesse in remembrance, and pray that God will not suffer the light of <hi>Israel</hi> to be quenched, but that it will still please him to preserue his annoynted from the perill of the sworde, and to giue her long and happie dayes, to the glorie of his Name, to the comfort of his chosen, &amp; to the stablishing of his trueth in this Lande, till the comming of his Sonne in the cloudes of Heauen. That this may the better be accomplished, this litle booke is by authoritie published, dayly to be vsed in <hi>Common prayer,</hi> where any is, or otherwise at such times as are by
<pb facs="3"/>lawe appointed for <hi>Diuine Seruice: viz,</hi> the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and one or two of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> following, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the discretion of the Minister, and likewise to be adioyned vnto those prayers, that are alreadie of late set foorth, for turning from vs the scarsitie of victuall, and warre, at such times as they are appointed to be read in the Church.</p>
