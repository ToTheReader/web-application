      <hi>How true that saying is of our Sauiour Christ. Qui male agit, odit lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem.</hi> Iohn. 3. <hi>May euidently appeare in this man, that hath translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Italian, <hi>and published in print, two little Treatises of</hi> Iohn Gerson. <hi>For knowing in his owne conscience, how many vntruthes he had heaped together in one preface of his, though a verie short one, and that in the two little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises themselues which he translated, there were errors of no small importance. And withall to how litte purpose those Treatises serued him, for the end which he pretended, he was ashamed to make either his owne name knowne or the Printers. And which is more, the better to couer and disguise it, he faines that he wrote it from</hi> Paris: <hi>Whereas it is but too wel knowne, that it was both written and printed in</hi> Venice. <hi>Now therfore, least this man should abuse the simple readers with his hypocrisie, we will proceed to examine, first the words of his preface, and after the words of</hi> Gerson, <hi>which hee hath translated, though not so faithfully as he pretendeth.</hi>
