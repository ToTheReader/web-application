   <p>Men of noble birth, delight much in antiquities, and it is their glory to derive their bloud by many descents from their thrice renowned ancestors: here I present to your Honourable view, that noble and most ancient family of <hi>Abraham, Isaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who were in favour with God, and in honour and great reputation with men: whose children they are, which imitate their piety and obedience: that famous Matron <hi>Paula,</hi> whom <hi>Hierome</hi> so much commendeth, was by her father descended of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the noble house of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> by her mother of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi>

Thus I trust your Lordships have learned to scale this ladder of honour, to the which you are called: to raise up those which are in the dust, to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the truth, to nourish and encourage the Preachers thereof, to speake for the innocent, to hold out your helpfull hand to the needy: so shall your Honours ascend from step to step, till you come to the top of the ladder, where Christ sitteth, who shall cast and tumble downe from thence all unfaithfull Stewards, and cut them off to have their portion with hypocrites, <hi>Matth. 24.51.</hi> but shall say unto you, and all other, that shall serve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully herein in earth; <hi>It is well done good servant and faithfull, thou hast beene faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in little, I will make thee ruler over much, enter into thy masters joy,</hi> Amen.</p>
