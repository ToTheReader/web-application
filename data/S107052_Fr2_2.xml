   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, I doe protest with <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> that in the Argument of Sorcery, (which is the subiect of this discourse) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was so farre transported with curiosity, as to plunge my selfe into an ouer-diligent intelligence of the same: because it is a Science that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for nothing but to disseason and perplex my spirit, as being an enemy vnto my soule, and therefore the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof distastfull to mee. The consideration whereof is common to all those, who leuell their actions to godly purposes, whereof that holy and ancient Father doth draw a learned and generall deduction in these notable words.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Tertul. lib. de anima.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Nos spiritualia nequitiae, non quidem socia Conscientia, sed inimica scientia nouimus: nec invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoria operatione, sed expugnatoria dominatione tractamus, multiformem luem mentis humanae,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Marc. 16.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>totius erroris artificem, salutis pariter animaeque vastatorem.</hi> In which he hath spoken a certaine truth: for what other thing can a man gaine by this vnnecessary, yet dangerous knowledge, but a true plague of man-kind, a palpable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in all sorts of error, and last of all, an ir-recouerable slide and downe-fall both of body and soule, into the pit of Hell? Notwithstanding the Theorick and contemplation of these things is not vnnecessary vnto vs that are Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because we are expresly commanded by Christ Iesus, in the persons of his Apostles, to cast out and chase away all wicked and vncleane spirits by the powerfulnesse of his name: for his pleasure is, that wee should be in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against Magicians, who doe call vpon them and wooe them to appeare vnto them by their softest and sweetest supplications. But we (as is already said) <hi>Non inuitato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb facs="236"/>
operatione, sed expugnatoria dominatione ipsos tractamus.</hi> So that the admirable effects which doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flow from so high and weighty a charge, may giue full answere and solution to the obiection of Payn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>s, who were wont, by way of réproch, to aske the Primitiue Christians, wherein their knowledge of wicked spirits did excell and surmount other mens. Vnto whom the same good father <hi>Tertullian</hi> answereth:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Tertul. lib de Testim. animae</hi>
      </note> that it was necessary that Christians should haue a greater knowledge of Diuels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as experience did well witnesse) none but Christians had authority and power to cast them out with violence and in despite of them. For as a Lord, or Master who is euer labouring to tame his slaue that is refractary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious against him, hath occasion to know his peruersues more thorowly then other men: euen so fareth it with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in respect of vncleane spirits. <hi>Daemonia itaque af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmamus esse, inquit, sane quasinon &amp; probemus, qui ea soli de corpore exigimus.</hi> Hence wee may make this deduction, that for the readier way to dissipate and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the kingdome of Satan, this kinde of Science is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required in Church-men: as the knowledge of Heresies is necessary vnto Catholick Doctors, that they may the better confute them,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Hierom. lib, 15. commen. in Esai. ad c. 47.</hi>
      </note> and those diseases that are pestilentiall must be vnderstood by Phisitians, if they hope to expell them. I doe heere desire, that in a subiect of this nature, there might bee a methode obserued in our manner of speaking, as the Stoicks anciently did in their discourses of the world, esteeming it as a great abuse to call things that in themselues were odious and filthy, by honest names, or things that were vertuous and honest, by filthy names: but insteed thereof, euery thing was to be expressed by words and appellations apt and proper to figure out the same. For vertuous actions were to bee expressed by termes that should breath and sound forth nothing but a decent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall commendation, but vicious and discommendable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be set forth with such fit and conuenient epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes, as might breed an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orrour and detestation of their
<pb facs="236"/>
filthinesse. Neither doe I desire this without iust cause, since that the malice of our times hath mis-applied the names of things that are Sacred to that which is base and ridiculous: and contrariwise, those things which are stayned with pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions much vnworthy of Christians, are many times graced with goodly and glorious appellations. Hence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth, that many haue so farre ouer-shot themselues, that they hold those for barbarous and illiterate fellowes, who in speaking of the Diuell doe vse the proper Greeke name, <hi>Diabolus,</hi> or the Hebrew name, <hi>Satan,</hi> or the word bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Latins, <hi>Malignant,</hi> which signifieth an aduersary, a back-biter, and one repleat with all malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: names so proper and proportionable vnto their nature, that the holy Scripture doth sundry times vse the same: yet is the vse thereof so discontinued in these times that we finde no mention of them in any Bookes. Euery one doth contend to sound forth no other name then the goodly appellation of <hi>Daemon,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Tertul. lib. de anima. Hierom. lib. 8. in Esai. ad cap. 27.</hi>
      </note> which signifieth one learned and wise: and indeed <hi>Plato</hi> and other great Philosophers and Poets haue vsed it as a name of God, who knoweth all things, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obserueth: whereas insteed thereof they might vse plenty of names very frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and particularly recited by S. <hi>Ierome</hi>; such as are the <hi>Diuell, Satan, Beliall,</hi> the <hi>Aspe,</hi> the <hi>Basiliske,</hi> the roaring <hi>Lyon,</hi> the great <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauer,</hi> and the like, which make a singular expression of his bloody and malicious nature. I could also wish, that in our French language, men should haue the vse of those names that would best befit the ordure and infamy of the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition of these blinde and more then beastly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers. For the tearme of Sorcerer signifieth nothing else, but one that casteth lot, being drawne from the Latine word <hi>Sors,</hi> which is sometimes taken in good part,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Leuit. 15. Deuter. 1. Luc. 1. Act, 1. S. Thom. 2.29 95. art. 8.</hi>
      </note> and may safely and religiously bee vsed, as these passages of the Scripture doe clearely shew vnto vs. <hi>Mittens super v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque hircum sortem. Cuius fors exierit Domino of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres. Iosua forte terram diuidet, forte exiit vt incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
<pb facs="237"/>
poneret. Cecidit sors super Mathiam.</hi> So that there may yet be vse of lots in the administration of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires, which are of most importance, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> after S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth notably obserue.<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. serm. 2. in Psal. 30.</hi>
      </note> Heereupon it is that I desire the imposition of some tearme, that should not thus gild-ouer this abominable art, but as they that practise the same are the most filthy and brutish creatures of the world, so should their appellation bee so odious, that it should import nothing but downe right villany, and should strike an horrour and detestation of them, into those that speake of them, or heare them mentioned. And this was the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> and the Stoicks,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Plat. in Cratil.</hi>
      </note> when they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prooue that the first institution of names, did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie according to the natures of things, and had not their imposition by chance, which they also euince by experience. For (said <hi>Plato</hi>) when I say <hi>Mee,</hi> I draw in my voice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my selfe, but when I say, <hi>Thee,</hi> I retort and let it out against him vnto whom I speake. And these subtle touches of Philosophy are experienced to bee true, not onely in the Greeke tongue, in which <hi>Plato</hi> wrote, but also in the two other principall tongues the Hebrew and the Latine.<note place="margin">
         <hi>S. August. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 102. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them</hi> Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicolas, <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>. <hi>worshippers of Diuels. Vpon the 96. Psal. where he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them worse then Idolaters.</hi>
      </note> If therefore these people had the stampe of these appeliations vpon them, <hi>Men enthralled vnto Diuels, the slaues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>: or as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth them, <hi>Worshippers of Diuels,</hi> or by such like tearmes as may best sute with their natures, they should be expressed vnto the world a great deale more naturally and more vnto the life, then by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terming them by the name of Sorcerers, which is deriued from the latine word <hi>Sortilegus</hi>: and by this meanes men would haue the malice and villany of such kinde of people in more horrour. For if wee narrowly sift and looke into them, it will be found, that there is no appearance or rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of goodnesse in them, but onely they are good in their naturall essence, like vnto Diuels: and of a truth they are the most grosse and impure Idolaters that euer were or may bee found, since that they worship the Diuell, and know him to be the Diuell. Whereas when Idolaters did worship
<pb facs="237"/>
him, they had euer an opinion that he was God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) the ignorant people that are I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. lib. 20. contr. Faust.</hi>
      </note> doe not sinne so grieuously, as doe your learned Philosophers: for the simple people doe not apprehend the spring and first originall of these Idolls, but Philosophers doe well know the head from whence they flow, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from vncleannesse and from the vices and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men: so that without comparison, the Christians who are more particularly acquainted with the will of God, shall bee in a farre more damnable estate then the former.</p>
   <p>After this discourse touching their names, I come now vnto the fact. I am not ignorant, that many haue formerly trauelled their spirits and pennes in this Argument of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, so that I might quit this labour, and repute my selfe vnworthy to publish my gleanings after their baruest: yet may I iustly vse the excuse of <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> who crauing pardon in that hee had vndertaken to write against the Gentiles in fauour of Christian Religion, since that such great and learned personages, as <hi>Iustin, Origen, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> had formerly written of the same; I haue done it (said hee) as it were vpon constraint, and to giue rellish and contentment vnto the variety of mens wills, because wee are bound to fit and accommodate our selues both to the learned and vnlearned, for the aduancement of the common good. Some (said he) haue written against the Gentiles, meerly from the grounds and authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which they giue no satisfaction vnto the Gentiles, in that they doe repudiate the same, but doe onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Christians and partly the Iewes. Others haue argued the case, and grounded the iudgment of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions vpon naturall reason, wherein those doe finde a main and an extraordinary delinquency, who doe sagely and soberly prefer the Scripture, before all other humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoeuer. But none (saith he) did euer mingle both together in any Authour, which is it that now remaineth to be done. And thereupon <hi>Lactantius</hi> concludeth, that if
<pb facs="238"/>
hee did make a hansome medlie or mingle of all these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, he hoped to giue contentment to euery body, euen downe to the Atheist. All which I apply vnto my selfe for my lawfull excuse. For some haue intreated of Sorcerers onely by way of a bare collection of Histories, and of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall proceedings against them, together with the relation of their owne auerments and confessions. Others haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more scholastically, and haue not departed or swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Commentaries which are made vpon the 4. bookes of the <hi>Sentences.</hi> A third sort, not rellishing this manner of proceeding, haue followed the steps and opinions of some auncient Paynim Philosophers, as <hi>Mercurius, Proclus, Iamblicus,</hi> whom they doe too much adhere vnto, euen where they thwart the authority of the holy Scripture. Whereupon I did apprehend, that there was yet left vntra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced another way a great deale more safe and lawfull, and more apt for the course and scope of my studies, (who for the glory of God, and releefe of the Church against the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of heresies, haue for the space of 40. yeares giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the reading of all sorts of bookes, but the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the fathers of the Church) to wit, that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course should be drawne from the Scriptures, and from the reading of auncient fathers: vpon which we are to ground the principall foundation, although other authors bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged on the By, to adde strength and illustration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For touching the first, they doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>akedly report the fact, but produce no proofes of the same. The second, doe propound their scholesticall resolutions of this point, but the nicenesse of these times will not digest such fare.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Tertul. lib. de testi. ani. Tertul. lib. de nima.</hi>
      </note> As for those of the third sort, wee will oppose against them by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> faith, <hi>Daemonem soli nouerunt Christiani, vel quaecunque apud Dominum secta.</hi> And in another place he rendreth a reason of this, saying, <hi>Cui veritas comperta sine Deo? cui Deus cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus sine Christo? cui Christus exploratus sine Spiritu Sancto? cui Spiritus Sanctus accommodatus sine fidei Sacramento?</hi> By which Gradation hee pointeth out vnto
<pb facs="238"/>
vs, that no man could euer exactly and without grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour know what belongeth vnto the soule, or vnto good and bad spirits (for hee speaketh of such in these aboue-cited passages) vnlesse he haue dranke of the water of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Philosophers (saith he) haue sometimes chanced vpon the truth, yet was it neuer without some mingle of errour, or else they did draw and borrow it from the Scripture, or it fared with them as with one that hath lost himselfe in a maze or labyrinth, who if after many crookings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, he chance to light vpon the right way out, it is to be attributed to hap and not to election; for they haue no assurance and certainty in whatsoeuer they say or inuent: and therefore the Academicks doe rather freely confesse, that they haue no certaine knowledge of any thing.<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. lib 13. contr. Faust. Mani. cap. 15.</hi>
      </note> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> is iust of <hi>Tertullians</hi> opinion: if <hi>Mercurius Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus</hi> (saith hee) or any other doe deliuer any thing that is good, it is not of authority sufficient to teach vs a wholesome doctrine, but it is onely able to conuince and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the Infidels. And as concerinng their sayings, that they are agreeable vnto truth, there is no lesse discrepancy and distance between their authority and the authority of the Prophets, then there is between Diuels and Angels. For the Diuels haue sometimes spoken truth, yet are we not presently to build a conclusion of Catholick doctrine vpon the same. The question then in hand is to be debated by that which is conformable to the holy Scriptures, and which hath been taught by the auncient fathers of the Church: which is the onely scope vnto which I aime in this worke, where we will also alleage (when there shall be a conueniency thereof) certaine Philosophers (which for the most part are already cited by S. <hi>Thomas</hi>) as farre as we shall finde them in conformity and league with Scriptures and the fathers. And if any shall oppose against them, tdey shall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues repelled and confuted by the ponderous and waighty allegations of naturall reason, to content and gaine in, or confound the Atheists, whose number is farre greater then it should be, although much inferiour vnto those (to
<pb facs="239"/>
my great greefe I speake it) that doe symbolize and comply themselues to Sorcerers, and adhere vnto them by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of superstitions: in which foule crimes men of the best ranke do sundry times inbarke themselues. So that I may well say with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that if it were as easie to execute iustice vpon the great ones,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Chrysost. hom. 2.11. Epist. ad Heb. hom. 10. in 1. Epist. ad Timoth.</hi>
      </note> as it is vpon the baser sort, all the prisons would be presently stuffed with Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Sorcerers. And else-where doth this good father with large effusion of teares deplore the blindnesse of such people, where he saith, <hi>Lachrymis &amp; gemitibus digna va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinia, obseruationes genesis, signa, ligaturae, diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, incantationes, &amp; caetera huiusmodi. Quae omnia magno profecto scelere praesumuntur, denique iram prouocare consueuerunt, atque eò magis, quo post in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentis be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <hi>Aug. lib. de. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. Dei cap. 18.</hi>
      </note> that this is a thing which God permitteth, thereby to occasion vs to fly into the close embracements of Christ Iesus our Mediatour, when we shal vnderstand, how shamelesly and brutishly the Diuell doth dragge vs vnto him, and worrieth vs as a famished Wolfe doth the harmeles sheepe. <hi>Quantò quippe in haec ima (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit) potestatem daemonum maiorem videmus, tantò tenacius mediatori est inhaerendum, per quem de imo ad summa contendimus.</hi> It remaineth that I should also handle, whether those things, which are spoken of Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, doe proceed from dreames and illusions, or whether they are reall and true. But fearing a glut of words in this long Epistle, which may perhaps seeme vnto some more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risome then delightfull, I haue remitted and fitted that discourse to the conclusion of this booke, hauing euer before me that which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> wittily obserueth, that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when hee seeth the end of a booke, or a chapter, is as glad, as a passenger to see the signe of his Inne, where hee is to repose himselfe.</p>
