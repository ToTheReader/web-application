   <p>WHat gaine groweth to studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readers by diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsing of Hystories, as there is none (I thinke) so insensate who féeleth not: so, after so many worthy clerkes whiche haue from time to time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the profite, the pleasure, the vse, yea the necessitie thereof, I déeme la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour néedelesse, and persuasion super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Onely by the way, and euen at a worde, it may suffice to say, that by the benefite hereof, the practises &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, the drifts &amp; dealings, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and calamities, the victories &amp; ouerthrowes, the welfare &amp; decay, the alteration and continuance, the good state and the badde, aswel of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, kingdoms, States, &amp; Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries, as of the affaires of priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and inferiour subiects are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly layd open vnto the perfite view of our eyes, and without the leauell of any daunger plainely discouered &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sēted vnto our cōsiderations. For they, without either feare or fauour; affectiō
<pb facs="4"/>
or parcialitie, doe effectuallie describe vnto vs the order and meanes howe Common weales begā, how they grew, how they continued, howe they flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and how they fall into decay and finall declination: what wayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced their honour, what wennes and disgraces emblemished their esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and what disorders eclypsed their maiesties: howe worthy persons for their worthy seruice haue bene worthelye inuested with titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and how drousie drones and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet capitaines, lulled in the cradle of ease, and dandeled in the lappe of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall securitie, haue in the ende con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely had their memoryes obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raked, and buried with their bodies in the pitte of Obliuion. Finallie, how vertue hath bene notablye rewarded, and vice shamefully reproached. All which be good inducements, to trayne our mindes to the due consideration of their ends: and may serue for readie directions (as it were) with the finger to poynt vs to the embracing of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and meanes to terrifie vs from
<pb facs="4"/>
pursuing of loosenesse and villanie. To this ende doe all hystories gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye tende: and to this effecte af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth this little Booke, plentifull stoare &amp; varietie of delectable matter: and the same so compendiouslye cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> within a small roome it caryeth as great substance of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable actes, and venturous exploytes, as many (perhappes) that beare a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger volume, and bragge it out with a loftier countenāce. Among other prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses worthily due vnto it, this (surely) is none of the least, that it is a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great antiquitie, and nowe of late by a studious Gentleman of this our countrey in his trauaile into <hi>Italye</hi> there happilye founde, and by him sensiblye translated. The copie whereof, being vnto mée (vpon trust) long agoe committed to peruse, and my symple aduise therein required, I coulde doe no lesse, at the request of my friende, but both peruse the booke, conferre the matter with other Hystro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, enlighten it with some néedefull marginall Notes, and finally
<pb facs="5"/>
with the glaunce of my poore pen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende the same, as a new found trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vnto thy curteous consideration. Friendly therfore, and thankefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, that the paines here-in taken and susteyned in thy behalfe, may be thought well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. Farewell.</p>
