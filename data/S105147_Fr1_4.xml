   <head>THE AVTHOR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occasion (gentle Reader) of Printing the Second Part of <hi>Lazarillo de Tormes</hi> hath beene, that there came to my hands a little Pamphlet, which treats of his Life, without any likelyhood of truth. The greatest part of it is stufft, with telling how <hi>Lazaro</hi> fell into the Sea, where he was turned into a Fish called a Tunny, and liued there many yeeres, marrying with a shee Tunny, by whom he had Children, as much Fishes as the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It relateth also the Warres that the Tunnies made, <hi>Lazaro</hi> being their Captaine, and many other Tales, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb facs="6"/> as false, and as ill grounded as foolish. And questionlesse, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it had a mind to vtter some foolish Dreame, or some dreamed folly. That Booke (I say) hath been the first motiue, that hath moued me to bring to light this second Part, word for word, without adding or diminishing, as I haue seen it written in certain Scroules kept in the Treasurie of Records of the Beggars of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and as I haue heard it a hundred times told by my Grandmother, and Aunts, by the Fires side in the Winter nights, and with the which my Nurse hath weaned me. For the better confirmation, I remember how they and others of our neighbours would dispute, How it could be possible that <hi>Lazaro</hi> could be so long vnder water (as is said in this second Part) without drowning? Some held <hi>pro,</hi> and the others, <hi>con.</hi> The first quoted <hi>Lazaro</hi> himselfe; who said, That the Water could not get into him, by reason
<pb facs="6"/> that he was filled and crammed vp to the very mouth. A good old man, well skild in swimming, to proue that to be an easie matter, interposed his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, affirming, That hee had seene a man, who going to swimme in the riuer <hi>Tagus,</hi> diued vnder Water, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in certaine Caues from Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set vntill next morning, that by the Sun-shine he did find the way out: and when as his Parents and Friends were wearie of bewayling and seeking his Body, to giue it buriall, he came forth safe and sound. The other difficultie that they found in his life, was, That no body did take <hi>Lazaro</hi> for a man, and that as many as saw him, should take him for Fish. To this answered a good Canon (who by reason that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old, did commonly sit in the Sunne among the Distaffe-Spinsters) That it was most likely of all, as agreeing with the opinion of many ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Writers, as among others, <hi>Pliny,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Aelian, Aristotle, Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who affirme, That there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Fishes in the Sea, the Males they call <hi>Titons,</hi> &amp; the Females <hi>Nereids,</hi> and all of them Sea-men, who from the Girdle upward haue the shape of perfect Men, and from thence downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Fishes. And I say, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that opinion had not beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by so well approued Authors; yet the Licence that the Fishermen had from the Lords Inquisitors, might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to excuse the <hi>Spanish</hi> ignorance, seeing it had been a case of Inquisition to haue doubted of a matter which their Lordships had consented should be showne for such. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (though out of my compasse) I wil relate an accident that befell a labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man of my Countrey: which was, That one of the Inquisitors hauing sent for him, to begge some of his Peares of him, which hee had heard were excellent; the poore Clowne
<pb facs="7"/> not knowing why his Lordship should send for him, was so skared, that hee fell sicke vpon it, till that by the meanes of a friend of his hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the businesse: And then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently starting from his Bed, he ranne into his Garden, pluckt vp the Tree by the roote, and presently sent it with the Fruit, saying, hee would not keepe in his house an occasion for their Lordships to send for him another time; so great is the feare that not onely labouring men, and the baser sort of people, but euen the Lords and Grands haue of them. All of them tremble when they heare these words, <hi>Inquisitor,</hi> and <hi>Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> more then the Leaues vpon the Tree with the gentle <hi>Zephirus.</hi> This is that which I haue beene willing to warne the Reader of that he may be the readier to answer, when such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall be propounded in his presence.
<pb facs="8"/> If hee accept this Second Part, let him expect the Third, with the Death and Testament of <hi>Lazarillo;</hi> which is the best of all: If not, hee may at least receiue my good will. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
