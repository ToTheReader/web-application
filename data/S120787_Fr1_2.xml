But because it hath pleased God through the glorie of your countenance to giue a new life to this Art, which not long agoe was so much neglected, that I thinke (if it had beene possible for vertue, to haue receiued so greate a staine) it would haue drawn neare to the danger of dispising; so many vnfurnished stables, like vnpeopled townes, and so many worthie spirits (ignorant in the noblest action) beeing prophetique signes of following desolution, but by your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse fauours it is not repayred (for that were but to pecce vp olderuines) but there is (as it were) a new and an eternall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
