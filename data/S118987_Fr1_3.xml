   <head>TO THE CITIZENS OF THE HEAVENLY <hi>IERVSALEM.</hi> INCREASE OF TRVETH And heauenly Wisedome be multiplied <hi>vpon you, with Peace and prosperitie in these latter dayes.</hi>

   <p>And to all her well affected Friends, that desire to <hi>see her Beautie, and to dwell within her</hi> Gates, happie successe.</p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Friend of yours sweete Citizens, vnworthy to take part with you in your riche peculiar things, makes bolde to present vnto your custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, treasures which I haue found. And also most earnestly intreates you to assist me against your many enemies, who lay claime to your Citie and all your priuiledges. Pray with me vnto the Lord your God, that his truth may take
<pb facs="3"/>place in the hearts of men, and bee regarded, and that all the hatefull enemies therof, and their lies may be brought to confusion. These things I entreat at your hands, making no doubt of your diligence herein. Goe but vp to the top of mount Sion, and you shall see your enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you with their shields in their hands and their swords drawne: but be of good courage, feare nothing, your God will deliuer them into your hands, and their weapons shall you consume like straw with the fire of his word, and the Citie shall be yours as it is, and it shall not he taken from you, nor the treasures thereof out of your pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. The daies are come wherin truth shall preuaile, And now deere friends to let you vnderstand my cause of writing to the aforenamed Master <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> and his company. It fell out of late that I being in company with some of them, had some conference with them, wherein they seemed very well affected to the things that I spake vnto them. One of them answering me in these words, I could willingly let all these things which you haue said, goe downe into me, but onely the going to the assemblies, another of them answered him instantly, you heard what he sayd for that: And so they requested me that I would set the things downe in writing, which had beene said, and they would either answere or subscribe vnto it, which thing I thought good to performe.</p>
   <p>And beloued friends, though I be the least worthy of you all to plead your cause, yet being mooued at their request, I haue made bold, and also seeing afterwards some writings of theirs published in Print, I was emboldened the more, perceiuing therein their desperate resolution, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming open war, challenging al, and therin the city of God: I was encouraged, seing it was his cause, perswaded he wold
<pb facs="3"/>be my protector in the defence of his owne Citie, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke his word and promise for my shield, with this confidence that he would not leaue me till they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, other weapons I haue none except the sword of the spirit, The skill of the learned disputers of this world looke not for, that is not my profession. Truth I hope yee shall find, but vested in a very low and simple Coate, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I did forget, matter onely was in my mind, the enemy came so fast vpon me that skill was laide aside. Truth I hope hath kept me company, though I could not garnish it with Rhetoricall ornaments. And therefore most noble and courteous Citizens, I haue made choice of you before all other to Dedicate this measure of truth vnto, because I knew, although you be the noblest Citizens in the world, yet are ye the poorest in spirit, your hearts can stoope, and your eyes can looke below, you are come downe from the hilles of pride, to the vallies of teares, yet can goe vp to the top of mount Sion; you looke not after the glory of this world, nor the wisedome thereof, It is foolishnes in your thoughts, which are seasoned with heauenly wisdome, if truth come you embrace it, you looke not vpon the coate of him that brings it, so that you iustifie I am pleased, what others say and iudge, (for my part) I passe not, but for their parts, I wish them to be aduised, and to giue eare to the voyce of the Spirit, and the Bride, which crieth, come whosoeuer is a thirst, and whosoeuer will, and take of the water of life freely.</p>
   <p>And to the end your Mother, deere Children of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, might a little refresh the spirits of her well affected friends, that haue beene so long time wearied with the Iarres and contentions that haue beene about her visible state: I thought good to publish this short description of
<pb facs="4"/>her vnto the open veiwe, that they might see her fruits what they be, her light, her priuiledges, and her markes, whereby shee may bee seene and knowne from the fleshly boasters of these distastfull times, who hauing beene so long accustomed to earthen buildings, cannot discerne nor tast that which commeth from aboue, and although not onely the generall, but specially the reformists, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, will not onely distast like wayward children but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen spurne against, yet will I not be discouraged, for there is a little remnant that thirsteth for reliefe, so they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, I passe not for the rest, for I know true wisedome which is alwaies from aboue, hath beene, is, and shall be for euer iustified of her Children, and they shall see Ierusalem to their great ioy, whereas the other groping in the dark, shall neuer behold that holy Citie, nor pertake of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges for euer. And although she hath cried oft, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her voice full many a time, and few or none regard what shee saieth, yet can shee not holde her peace, but shee must pleade her Childrens cause, against those that lay claime to their right and inheritance, challengeng them the field, and setting vp a flagge of defiance against the Citie of truth and the God of Israell. Behold here comes one the least of ten thousand, that doth accept the challenge seeing others doe hold their peace, and although hee know not how to beare armes in the field as the manner is, yet he promiseth in the name of the God of Iacob, with a sling and a stone, to bring their champion on his knees, for all his stout words, that his army who trusted in him, may be glad to take their flight, and you enioy your Citie in peace, And thus most noble Citizens farewell.</p>
