      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Translation of these Epigramms is a thing (Reader) which I confesse for divers Reasons I was leath to publish: One is, because they are but a part of Martiall, and chosen out here and there; so that I am lyable to a double censure, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the skill in translating, but the judgement in choosing of them may be called in question. But in that case
<pb facs="5"/>
not only Ioseph Scaliger, who published divers of these Epigramms, translated into Greek, but divers others, in other Languages, may in part excuse me for meddling with a part of a Booke. The second reason is, because it is more than probable, that divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have exercised or pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in translating some of these, and may therefore peruse mine with a more rigid censure. but that I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the goodnesse of their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The third reason is, because that having already published two Translations, I was loath any more to vexe the Romane Poets (who shall sleep quietly in their Vrnes hereafter for me) though Translation bee a thing
<pb facs="5"/>
which, I thinke, the ablest men doe not at all condemne. Some men there are who complaine of late that too much learning is brought into our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Language, and that that is by others attained at too easie a rate, which cost themselves more labour. Those (as I take it) are such pretty Schollers as have rather strived to get some skill in the Latine or Greeke tongues, than to furnish themselves with the substance of Art, which is contained in those tongues; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so much reall Learning as may commend them to the world, would faine bee applauded for the shadow of it: Like some unlearned or iniudicious Preachers in Countrey parishes, who
<pb facs="6"/>
would rather be liked by the ignorant People for speaking of Latin sentences, than informing their knowledges with substantiall Doctrine, and have the fortune to bee praised by none, but those which doe not understand them: and indeed those which I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mis-likers of Translation, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfect in the Latin, nor able in their native Language. There are many things (Reader) in this Worke I doe confesse, which must intreat a favourable excuse, and dare not stand a strict censure; especially the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramme of all, which is in the Latin both too full to be rendred in a Verse of ten Syllables, and subject to divers Constructions of sense: But being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated which

by a friend of mine to doe all the Booke of Spectacles, I could not leave out the first of them. Some of them have lyen many yeares by me, and were not intended for the Presse, and many of them in loose Papers I have lost, and perchance thou wilt say (and I am of that opinion) it had beene no great matter if they had beene all lost.</p>
