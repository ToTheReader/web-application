   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie are the waies, by the which our most mercifull God, hath sought to bring vs of <hi>England</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to true repentaunce. Who is able to recken vp all the benefites, spirituall and temporall, that we haue receiued at his handes? As, the light of the Gospell shining in the middest of vs, and the meruailous preseruation of our gratious Prince, to our speciall comfort, notwithstanding the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb facs="3"/>
wretched practises of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked against her Highnesse person, &amp; the state, which he from time to time hath discouered, and brought many of the principall authors to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued confusion. He hath also chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs sundrie times, and in diuerse maners threatned vs more plagues, than as yet he hath brought vppon vs. Among other warninges, this ought specially to bee remembred for euer,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Jsa.</hi> 7.18.</note> that this last Sūmer, hissing for the Spaniards, he brought thē so far from their owne Country, &amp; so nere vnto our coasts, with resolute minds to haue made hauocke of vs. Jt was not without him, as blaspheming <hi>Rabsache</hi> spake of his masters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces comming against <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Jsa.</hi> 36, 10.</note>
      <pb facs="3"/>
no doubt more truely then hee was ware of. True it is, their purpose was not to doe that which the Lorde meant, but rather in the pride of their hearts to haue made manifest breaches of his commaundements, in seeking the suppressing of his truth here professed, and the conquest of a lande, whereunto they can make no iust claime or title. Howbeit, wee ought to looke into the Lordes secrete purpose ouer-ruling all, and carrying men to that which they knowe not, yea, cleane contrarie to that which they purpose,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Jsa.</hi> 10.6.7.</note> euen in the selfe same action.</p>
   <p>Therefore whatsoeuer they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Lorde in them shooke his rod ouer vs, to draw vs to repentance,
<pb facs="4"/>
that so in deede hee might not strike. He put vs in great feare, that so hee might driue vs to flie to him, where onely comfort is, by earnest praiers. At that time many praied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed sinnes: and blessed bee his name, that for his owne honour, hearde the cries of his poore seruants, so bearing witnes, that it is no vain thing, in the time of distresse, to humble our selues before him. How blessed the euent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath bin, is generally knowen amongnst vs, and the comfort thereof what true English heart is there, that doth not feele and reioyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Jt remaineth that the daunger then imminent beeing escaped, wee of this Natian doe not onely with our mouthes, continually giue God prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<pb facs="4"/>
but that also by the rodde thus shaken ouer vs, and as it were readie to haue bene laid vpon our shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we learn to turne to him, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our euill waies, least not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus, as the Lorde calleth for at our handes, in the ende he bring vpon vs deserued destruction. Against this destruction as it is my part alwaies to praie, &amp; by Gods assistance I hope to praie: so I should haue great cause to be glad, if by any meanes the Lord would vouchsafe to vse me as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, to stirre vp, though neuer so few, to such a serious consideration of these thinges as ought to bee in all. For the which purpose I present vnto thee (Christian Reader) this little treatise heere following, containing
<pb facs="5"/>
certaine meditations of praiers and thanksgiuings. Those that be of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I wrote at such time as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes were come into the narrow seas, and then there were some copies written to the vse of some friendes. True it is, in the confession of sinnes, vpon some occasiō there is some thing altered from that which was then written: but in the rest, J remember little otherwise than was then sette downe, as the copies then giuen forth can beare witnesse. Since our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliuerance, I wrote the other meditations concerning thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, Both ioyned together in some vritten bookes, I haue sithence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to some of good calling, to whome J was bounden to wishe all
<pb facs="5"/>
good, as well for their profession of the truth, as for speciall kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses towarde mee. And to more J had some purpose, that waie to haue made them common. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit beeing read ouer by some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godlie men of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thought they might bee profitable if they were put in print: I was content in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe to yeelde vnto their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accordinglie doe heere offer them to thy viewe. J hope thou mayest make some vse vnto thy selfe of either of them, if thou reade them with a sanctified minde. For, although the Meditations concerning Praiers maye seeme vnto some to no greate purpose,
<pb facs="6"/>
because that occasion for that time is now remoued. Yet the sinnes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doe stil remaine, with which no doubt God is highly displeased. These thou maist there see in some sort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, as also how by thy selfe, from a feeling heart thou maist confesse both them and thine owne, and humbly craue pardon. Moreouer, the hatred and mallice of the Spaniard and his partakers, is not yet quenched, but rather we may be assured, much more increased, so as they will but wait op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to set vpon vs againe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, other Churches, as those of <hi>France</hi> and of the lowe Countries, whose case wee ought to tender, haue many deadly enemies, which thirste after bloude. So as still necessarily
<pb facs="6"/>
there is required an imploying of our and their forces, against such commō aduersaries. I hope that frō those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, thou maist haue some help, to further thee with comforte in thy praiers for the one, and against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The meditations for thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, J trust to euery indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will seeme to be of some vse. My purpose is not, to require that either of them bee vsed, as an ordinarie forme of praier or thankesgiuing, but that by reading of them, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy selfe sometimes in them, thou shouldest helpe thy selfe, towards a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accomplishmēt of those dueties, though thou do it more shortly and in other words. Jf for these endes, this my poore trauaile, may any way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="7"/>
thee, I praie thee giue the praise to God, to whome alone it is due, and remember to praie most earnestly for me, and for all the rest, whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to vse in anie sort for thy comfort. This one thing I desire to haue remembred, that many of the thinges specially mentioned in the praiers, haue bene gratiously perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord, &amp; accordingly they be acknowledged in the thāksgiuing: to assure vs (as was said before) that praiers specially ioined with true fasting, be not in vaine, but to singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar purpose. And yet, J desire not to be so mistaken, as if J arrogated any thing to my poore and weake prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, made by me in my publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, or priuate exercise. No, I doe
<pb facs="7"/>
vnfainedly from my heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge mine owne vnworthinesse, to bee hearde crying for my selfe, much more for the Church and this state. J am persuaded, that the things which I then meditated, and which the Lord directed me to write, were also thought vpon, and remembred with more feruencie of spirite and single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, by other the faithfull seruants of God, Preachers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, of our owne Nation, and of other Countries. They stoode vp in the gap, they cried to the Lorde,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Exo.</hi> 17.11.</note> they helde vp their handes, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath preuailed. They in deede were chariots, horsemen, and forces by sea and land, as to that purpose <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha</hi> spake of <hi>Elias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioash</hi> of him.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.14.</note>
      <pb facs="8"/>
Their praiers made in the bitter mourning of their soules, for their owne and our sinnes, did the Lorde heare, blessing the worthy seruice of our valiant Countrimen imploide in those affaires, and without meanes, doing wonderfully for vs: not for any worthinesse in themselues, or in their praiers, but for the worthinesse of Christ Iesus, and for the honor of his owne name.</p>
   <p>Jt doth remaine that thou thy selfe bee carefull, wiselie to applie the fearefull warning of the Lord, in the enemies comming against vs, and his vnspeakable mercie in our wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliueraunce, to stirre thee vp to vnfained conscience of pleasing him, in thy selfe, and such as be of thy spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb facs="8"/>
charge. As also to praie, that whatsoeuer is amisse in the land, and so displeaseth our most mercifull God, may bee amended. Whatsoeuer thou art, I exhort thee earnestlie to call vpon the Lorde, that the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies risen vp amongst our selues, may christianlie and brotherlie bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. That so the peace of our worthie Church beeing procured: we may all, whether we be Preachers or professours, proceede one waie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth, to bestowe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer gift wee haue, to the rooting out of all sinne, and to the establishment of the kingdome of Christ Iesus, in the hearts of all those, that bee vnder any of our charges. Specially, because the haruest is great,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 9.</note> and the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="9"/>
in comparison bee but few, praie the Lorde of the haruest, that such men whome he hath sanctified in life &amp; learning, so as it were, separating them,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15.</note> from their mothers wombes, to the worke of the ministerie, may bee thrust out into his haruest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the same with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to doe their dutie. As also that such as bee altogether vnfit for so great a burthen, may haue nothing to doe in the most holie ministerie of the Lord. Those whome these causes doe anie waie concerne, most humblie and with all reuerence, vppon the knees of heart, euen in the bowels of Christ Jesus I doe intreate, to shewe their zeale to his honour, which shed his most precious bloud for their sins,
<pb facs="9"/>
and their compassion vpon their dere brethren &amp; Countrie men his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in many places of the Realme yet wallowing in ignorance, &amp; other sins, in doing what they can, that all the people of the land may be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the euerlasting truth of God, that so they may walke in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his blessed maiestie, and in all dutie to our gratious Prince, and all such as vnder her gouerne the state. If these causes of so great importance be not loked vnto as they ought, but that iniquitie be still suffered to grow and to abounde, notwithstanding all that which the Lord hath said to vs from his worde, and wonderfullie done for vs; I will wish to weepe in secrete, and that mine eies may
<pb facs="10"/>
drop downe teares, for what els may we looke for, but the captiuitie of the Lordes flocke. And thus doe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee (Christian Reader,) to the Lorde, and my selfe to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of thee, in thy most earnest prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. March. <hi>7. 1588.</hi> the meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous yeere, in respect of the Lorde his wonderfull deliuerance of vs, and the confusion brought vpon our enemies, and the enemies of his Church, he make vs alwaies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Amen.</p>
