   <l>I Heare one aske me, if I could finde none,</l>
   <l>To dedicate this Poeme to, but one</l>
   <l>That's now transplanted to another sphere,</l>
   <l>And better measures sings then anie's here.</l>
   <l>Its true indeede, the world's large and wide,</l>
   <l>And many were there I confesse beside,</l>
   <l>My now deceased-<hi>Patron,</hi> I could finde,</l>
   <l>But none so well agreeing with my minde;</l>
   <l>He was one that I honour'd, and his worth</l>
   <l>Deseru'd a pregnant <hi>Muse</hi> to set it forth,</l>
   <l>Which though I haue not I will shew my best,</l>
   <l>To crowne him sleeping in the bed of rest,</l>
   <l>Where, while I write, my passion shall appere,</l>
   <l>By each lines accent mixed with a tere:</l>
   <l>But you will say this subiect cannot moue,</l>
   <l>Such firme impression, cause it treats of loue,</l>
   <l>A sadder straine would better fitting be</l>
   <l>"Drain'd from the streames of graue <hi>Melpomene,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Where euery sentence might that passion breede,</l>
   <l>"as if himselfe were here portraide indeed;</l>
   <l>This I could doe and so expresse him too</l>
   <l>(But that his worth would be a shame to you.</l>
   <l>
      <pb n="3" facs="128"/>That are desertlesse to see him by Fate</l>
   <l>Lopt, that has left you much to imitate,</l>
   <l>Of honour I dare say, (which ere't be long,</l>
   <l>" May be a subiect to a better song.)</l>
   <l>But I would haue you know how ere this is,</l>
   <l>It was from th'cradle nat'ralized his:</l>
   <l>Nor would I raze my Patrons dedicate,</l>
   <l>"How ere he seem'd to be obscur'd by Fate,</l>
   <l>But as I lou'd him liuing, my desire</l>
   <l>Is to expresse my loue vnto him higher</l>
   <l>Being now dead; that though my friend be gone,</l>
   <l>Yet life and death to friendship may be one:</l>
   <l>For th'print of loue if it be stampt aright,</l>
   <l>Is most in heart when it is least in sight.</l>
