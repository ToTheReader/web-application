   <head>R.G. the translatour of M. Iunius his letters: To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>SVch as of late yeares have rent themselues from the holie service of God, used im the publique congregations and Churches of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, being destitute of any sound warrant from the worde of God, have sought from time to time so much the more earnestly (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of such is) to shroude themselves vnder the shadowe of humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Hēce it came to passe that Master Francis Iunius, a mā of great learning, and godlinesse, was solicited by some of them (as may appeare by these letters ensuing) in the yeare 99. to be a favourer of their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious opinions and of their vnchristian disordered and vndutifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: whose answere, being delivered by himselfe to a religious and worshipful knight, and so comming to my handes, I have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to communicate with thee, by the motion of some godly and well disposed, hoping that through the blessing of God, and thy prayers it may proove a good meanes to stay such as are wavering, to confirme such as doe stand, and to recover such as are fallen. For although he doe not enter into an exact discussing of the question with arguments, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and answeres: yet he vseth a very grave and godly admonition, which is oftentimes of greater fruite, then a long and learned dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And whosoever doth diligently studie the booke of God, shal finde, that the holy Prophets &amp; Apostles do in manie places insist upō a plaine &amp; simple asleve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ation of the truth rather then vpon multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of proof &amp; arguments. Besides, if we observe the story of the holy Martyrs of our own Church &amp; others, we may preceive that by the sound profession of their faith, and suffering for the same, they have glorified God and advanced the kingdome of Iesus Christ aswel as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done by arguments and reasons. And yet notwithstanding if thou do well obserue these letters of Master Iunius, thou shalt finde in them not vaine and emptie wordes: but waightie and sounde reasons grounded upon the holie Scriptures of God. Thus praying thee to take these first fruites of my poore laboures in this kinde in good part, and beseching god to give a blessing hereunto; I bid thee heartily farewel in the Lord.</p>
