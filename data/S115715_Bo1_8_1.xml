   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing of late (gentle Reader) corrected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed sundrie faults, that by negligence in printing haue crept into my Fathers <hi>Generall Prognostication:</hi> Among other things I haue found a description or Modill of the world, and situation of Spheres Coelestiall &amp; elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie according to the doctrine of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> whereunto all Vniuersities (led thereunto chiefely by the authoritie of (<hi>Aristotle</hi>) sithens haue consented. But in this our age, one rare wit (seeing the continuall errors that from time to time more and more haue been discouered, besides the infinite absurdities in their Theoricks, which they haue been forced to admit that would not confesse any Mobilitie in the ball of the earth) hath by long study, painefull practise, and rare inuention deliuered a new Theoricke or Modill of the world, shewing that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth resteth not in the Centre of the whole world, but not onely in the Centre of this our mortall world or Globe of Elements, which enuironed and enclosed in the Moones Orbe, and together with the whole Globe of mortalitie is caried yeerely round about the Sunne, which like a king in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of al raigneth and giueth lawes of motion to the rest, sphaerical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispersing his glorious beames of light through all this sacred Coelestial Temple. And the Earth it self to be one of the Planets, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his peculiar and strange courses turning euery 24 houres round vpon his owne Centre: whereby the Sun and great Globe of fixed starres seeme to sway about and turne, albeit indeede they remaine fixed. So many waies is the sense of mortall men abused. But reason &amp; deep discourse of wit hauing opened these things to <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and the same being with demonstrations Mathematical, most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

by him to the world deliuered: I thought it conuenient toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the old Theorick also to publish this, to the end such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble English mindes (as delight to reach aboue the baser sorte of men) might not be altogether defrauded of so noble a part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie. And to the ende it might manifestly appeare, that <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> meant not (as some haue fondly excused him) to deliuer these grounds of the earths mobilitie, onely as Mathematical principles fayned, and not as Philosophicall truly auerred: I haue also from him deliuered both the Philosophical reasons by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, produced to maintaine the Earths stabilitie, &amp; also their solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and insufficiencie, wherein I cannot a little commend the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> graue Philosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who seeing (no doubt) the sufficiencie of his own reasons in seeking to confute the earths mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vseth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>se words: <hi>De his explicatum est, ea, qua potuimus facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:</hi> howbeit his disciples haue not with like sobrietie maintained the same. Thus much for my owne part in this case I will only say. There is no doubt, but of a true ground, truer effects may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then of principles that are false: and of true principles, false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or absurdities cannot be inferred.</p>
   <p>If therfore the Earth be situate immoueable in the Centre of the world, why find we not Theoricks vpon that ground to produce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as true and certaine as those of <hi>Copernicus?</hi> Why cast we not away those <hi>Circles Aequātes</hi> and motions irregular? seeing our own Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe the light of our Vniuersities hath taught vs: <hi>Simplicis corporis simplicem oportet esse motum.</hi> But if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, it be found impossible (the Earths stabilitie being graunted) but that we must necessarily fall into these absurdities, and cannot by any meane auoyd thē: why shall wee so much do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Behold a noble Question to be of the Philosophers &amp; Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians of our Vniuersities, argued not with childish inuentions, but with graue reasons Philosophical, and irreproueable Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
