   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Lord AMBROSE DVDLEY, Earle of Warwicke, Baron Lisle, Master of hir Maiesties Ordinance, Knight of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order of the Garter, and one of hir Highnes priuie Councell: And to the right Honorable, and godly Lady his wife; <hi>Iohn Vdall,</hi> wisheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of all true Honor, and comfort in this life, &amp; euerlasting happines, in that which is to come</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath euer bene the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disposition of man, (right Honourable) in all those miseries that fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, to turne his minde a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, and thinke amisse of the cause of his estate and condition, &amp; therevpon to vse such means for the redres thereof, as shal neuer amend, but rather make worse that whiche they would helpe; or if they take in hand any of the wayes that be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet it is that which shoulde bee the laste, as their owne pollicie and wisdome, and neuer thinke of their
<pb facs="3"/>
sinnes that haue procured Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure against them, that they might begin by repentance to seeke reconciliation with him: which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postrous dealing doth not only pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the hart of perticular men, but also beareth the swaye (for the most parte) euen in common-wealthes and gouernements. For we see, that when any thing is amis in the same, there is great consultation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident aduising, how things may be redressed: but the wayes that be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, are (for the most part) framed in the shop of humane pollicy only, &amp; therefore the effect thereof, is but as the loppinge of some boughes or twigges from the toppe of a tree, after which, it doth rather flowrish the more, then wither away: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it shoulde bee considered, that all ennormities and disorder doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from sinne, and euerie breach in a state, from the displeasure of the
<pb facs="3"/>
Lorde for the contempte or neglect of his holy commaundements: and therefore (if euer wee looke to haue our policies prosper) to search more narowly into the wil of God, to the end it may be established with more authority, and practized with more holy obedience; and then shoulde those wise plots, that the guiftes of nature or experience doe teach vs, (when once they com in their place attendinge vppon that Souereigne scepter of Gods most blessed word) receiue a blessinge from the Lorde and haue a good issue, whiche else shall bee as the winde, that beeinge long trauelled of, whē it is brought forth doeth vanishe, as the smoake in the sight of the sunne. This lesson doth the holy Ghoste, (by this his Prophet IOEL) teache vnto vs in his firste chapter, more at large, the doctrine wherof (as neere as I could remember) according as the Lorde
<pb facs="4"/>
did inable me to vtter it, I haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being drawne thereunto, both by the importunitie of some, whom I might not well denie in so honest a request, as also by the conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of the doctrine, for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of moe then heard it.</p>
   <p>Nowe among many other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instrumentes, that the Lorde (in his mercie) hath stirred vp, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wishe well vnto, but also to trauayle for the good of that poore people his faythfull seruauntes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom it hath pleased him to place me, not onely I, but they also doe stand bound in dutie (and shall so remaine still) vnto your HH. for that carefull diligence, that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you both to vse, then, to intreat for vs, when (if God had not beene on our side) the floodes of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mens practises had runne ouer our heades, to the vtter vndoing of all good beginninges among vs, so
<pb facs="4"/>
that whatsoeuer good it shall please the LORDE to dooe in his Churche by my weake laboures, (wherevnto I thought an ende had beene added) your Honours may iustly bee reputed the instrumentes of the same: In regarde whereof, I (desiringe too haue some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitye, to shewe the thankfulnesse of our hearts) haue especially made choyce of youre Honours, vnto whome I might dedicate these my poore laboures, most humblye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatinge the same, to accept heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not accordinge to the valewe that it caryeth, (whiche is verye small) but accordinge to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the giuer, whoe acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him-selfe (together with that people whiche haue the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of my ministery) to be bound to pray vnfeignedly vnto the Lord for your Hh. that it would please him to increase al the graces of his sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb facs="5"/>
spirite vppon the same, to the further aduauncement of his glorie, the greater benefite of hys poore Church, and fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of your owne soules. Sobeit.</p>
