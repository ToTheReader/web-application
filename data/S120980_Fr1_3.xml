   <head>¶The Translater sendeth greeting to
all Christians that are vnder
Heauen.</head>
   <p>I Cannot maruell ynough wherof it
commeth that all of vs are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by iniuries than by benefyts: and
that we take the one so much to hart,
imprinting them in our rememberance, and
forget the other so suddenly. Truly vve can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, but that among so manie other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
vvherwith we are vnhappely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyled,
we haue also takē this, of the great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and maymednesse of our earthly &amp;
transitorie humane nature, vvherin ther can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined any thing more vnconueni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent
nor more hurtfull, than reprochefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse,
vvhich a man myght ryghtly
terme the welspring of al vyces. For by it our
minds are so drawen away &amp; peruerted, that
the more we be beset rownd about and loden
with the benefits of GOD our souerein Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so much the more become we blookish
and as it were distraught and out of our wits,
ronning after our owne lustes and vanities,
where through (as though wee had drunke
of the riuer Lethe,) we fouget our selues and
mispend our whole time, bwisying our heads
like litle children that go seeking of pinnes in
<pb facs="3"/>
the sand, wherabout they are so wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed,
that although a man cal them, they here
him not, or at leastwise make as though they
herd him not: frō whence if we did now and
thē lift vp our eyes vnto heauē, &amp; inforce our
selues to remember the great benefits that we
dayly receiue of his right fatherly goodnesse
and mercie: it were not to be dowted but we
shold be more inclined to loue him &amp; to obei
his holy will, than we be: wheras (which worse
is) we be not only careles to yeald dew thākes
vnto him, but also at all times cease not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
him: so deepely is the vyce of vnthāk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
rooted in vs. Ryghtly may he be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for vnthankfulnesse, which acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not the good that hath bin done to him,
at leastwyse by saying gramercie: Vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is he that forgetteth it: but toto vnthāk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is he that rēdereth euil for good: VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cā find no lawfull excuse, bicause that
which waye soeuer we turne our selues, the
bountifulnesse of this great GOD shyneth
throughot vppō vs. Let vs a little sturre vp
our wits, and let vs looke about vs as farre and
wyde as this howge frame of the worlde may
extende, so deuynely set togither, and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with so great diuersitie of goodly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
so well compassed, and in such an order
<pb facs="3"/>
so vvysely compacted, that there is nothing
superfluouse, nothing vnprofitable, nothing
wherof ther may not be rēdred a rason. This
howge Sonne the fountayne of all lyght and
heate, and the cause of all earthly generacion:
the Moone which marketh vs out the yeeres
the monethes and the seasons: the Sky so
trimly azured and richely sette with gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
starres: this howge Sea which beateth vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
al sydes of the earth, the weyght wherof is
born vppon his own round counterpeis: the
great nomber of liuing creatures that are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it, whereof some flye in the ayre, euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
dispersed and othersome dwell in the
holow caues of it, which nature hath fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of set purpose for them: vvhat shal I say
more? So many high moūtaines within whose
veynes are found innumerable tresures: And
others, from whēce issew many a fayre spring
spowting out their thinne and cleere water.
And othersome wheroutof doo gush violent
streams and plesāt riuers, nourishing infinite
nombers and kindes of fishes: So many trees
and plants yelding most delicate fruites and
sweete sauours: Such store of medicinable
herbes and rootes: So many plaines and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
most fruitfull: Such store of medowes
beawtifyed with their louely flowers: And to
<pb facs="4"/>
be short, the ful howgenesse of the whole, the
power of the Elemēts, and the natural beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the creatures: what are they else but the
vtteraunce and open shewing of gods loue &amp;
great liberality towards vs: of which eche one
in his kinde giueth glory to the Lorde? yea,
aske euen the beasts, and they will informe
thee: demaund of the fowles of the aire, and
they wil tell thee: or else speake to the earth,
and she will report vnto thee: and to the fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of the Sea, and they wil answer thee: The
Lord spake the word,<note place="margin">Iob. 12.</note> and we were made: he
commaunded, and we were created. For in his
hand is the life of euery liuing thing. Aud by
him haue al of vs our being, mouing, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewance.
Such is the speech of all creaturs.
Onely man, who is made after the image and
likenesse of god, indewed with vnderstāding,
memorie, and reason, (shewing himselfe in
that beehalfe more vnhappie than the brute
beasts,) passeth ouer the abundāce of so great
benefyes with his eyes shet, betrampling and
beraying them with his feete, as a swyne doth
precious stones: In somuch that after he hath
once wholly buryed remembrance, ther insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ignorance &amp; vtter blyndnesse. O lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
state of reasonable man, who can hope
for any change in thee, except it be from euil
<pb facs="4"/>
to worse, seing thou hast no knowledge at all
of God, and that, all his benefits are despysed
through thyne extreme vnthankfulnesse in
this behalfe? If so many creatures wherwith
this whole howge worlde is garnished to thy
vse: and (to touch thee yit more neerely) if
the cunning compacting togither of thyne
owne bodie, which may well be called a little
world, as wherin a man may behold the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
wisedom of the workmaister: if thy soule
wherin shineth the inuisible image of of the
euerlasting God: if thyne owne lyfe: if the
consideration of so great abundance of good
things whereof he giueth thee the vse euery
day, are not sufficiēt ynough to moue the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of thy hart: at leastwise yit oughtest
thou of reason to be inflamed and prouoked
by the benefyte of all benefyts, and by that
most precious gift which he hath made vnto
thee of his owne propre and only Sonne, who
is the very image of his substāce, &amp; in whom
dwelleth the whole fulnesse of the Godhead,
togither with all the treasures of wisedom, &amp; al
knowledge: Yea &amp; so much ought it to moue
thee the more, bicause that without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard
that thou wart his great enemie, he hath
layd all thyne infirmities vpon his backe and
made him to dye vpō the crosse for thy sake,
<pb facs="5"/>
punishing thy sinnes in him, for the which
thou thy selfe haddest deserued eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiō.
Go now thou vnthankful persone, and
deuise all the excuses that thou wilt: and they
shall serue thee to no purpose, but to accuse
thee and to giue sentence againste thy selfe.
The wonderfull creation, order, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt
of this howge world, can giue thee know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
of his fatherly loue, wisedome, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power, although not in all poynts to the
full. But in Iesus Christ crucifyed, all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells
of gods mercie are opened vnto thee at
large and perfectly. There is no more any
veyle that can hinder thee from the knowing
of so great loue. Seest thou not how that at
his deathe the veyle vvas rent asunder in the
myddes? And when he cryed that all was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
&amp; bowed down his holy head, he gaue
a tokē that peace was made betwene God and
man. Let vs therfore henceforth learne O my
brethren to acknowledge the souerein bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
which we haue receiued by Iesus Christe
crucifyed Let vs behold the perfectnesse of
his lyfe, and his most holy Doctrine. Let vs
open our eyes at the vnmeasurable bryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his euerlasting truth, and let vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
our force folow the way wherein he hath
gone afore vs. Let vs with a cheerful and glad
<pb facs="5"/>
hart imbrace the crosse which he hath set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs: and discharging our shoulders from
all burthens and al sinne wherin we are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
let vs ronne with pacience to the combat
that is appointed for vs, hauing an eye to the
beginner &amp; accōplisher of faith Iesus Christ,
vvho in stede of worldly glory susteyned the
crosse, and despyzed all the shame therof. Let
vs put of the old man with all his vvretched
and combersom dooinges and greuous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
and cloth our selues with the new man
vvhose yoke is sweete and burthen lyght. Let
vs by trewe fayth runne betweene the armes
of his mercy, and pray him too voutsafe too
lyghten vs, and too make vs capable of al his
graces, and specially of the great benefite that
vve haue receiued of him by his crosse. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the which, forasmuch as ther is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into my handes a little treatyze compiled
in the Italian toung, wherin he is maruelously
vvell and liuely drawen vvith another maner
of pensil than peinters vse: I thought it good
to put it into French, to the end that my coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
also might take profite by it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
lyke comfort as I haue receyued by it:
And specially the simple people and such as
haue no great depth of knowledge. For it fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that the Author (vvhosoeuer he vvas)
<pb facs="6"/>
vvas vvholy mynded to apply all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
them, without seeking or affecting anye
finenesse of speech, or great darknesse of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
But euen as in Sōmertyme we see the
Riuer Saon go gently to ioyne himself vvith
the Riuer of Rhone, without doing anye do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to any bodye: euen so goeth this man,
slyding so smothely into the bosome of hys
deere spouse Iesus Chryst, without staying at
any other thing: that ouermaliciouse should
he bee, which would looke awrye on him, or
by any meanes let him of his course.
And thus my brethren fareye well in
God, who inriche you with his
graciouse giftes from day
to day. Amen.</p>
