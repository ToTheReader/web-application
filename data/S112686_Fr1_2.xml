But of her miserie I haue writ at large; the iudgement whereof (right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, right Worshipfull, and wise) relieth on your fauourable censures, who haue both aucthoritie to conuict, and knowledge to commend. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of this poesie of greene hearbs, gathered out of a spacious Country garden, you make your seuerall choices of some (though but of few) to your contents, I shall thinke my trauailes richly guerdoned: suruay them curiouslie, and you shall find much varietie, but especially of Rue, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,

and Tyme: But indeede wee may rue the time that euer that bitter weede Wormewood became so sweete a Nosegay. My labour is past, my booke newly come from the presse, and it is in your hands to be censured; if therefore it passe with your good likings, my desires are accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and my expectation satisfied.
