   <head>To the Gentlemen that are disposed.</head>
   <p>GEntlemen, if I haue fitted your humors with this fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, much good doe it yee, I would it were for you: if it be offensiue to some queasie stomacke, it proceedeth rather vpon some distempered humour in the partie so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then of any fault of mine: and yet to speake truly, I meant not to please all. For when I first vndertooke the subiect, I knew it could not be handled without offence: but as I haue not detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any one particularly of mine owne knowledge, so if any man vpon a guiltie conscience will accuse himselfe, his fault be vpon his owne head: should we forbeare to speake against vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vicious will be offended? if that might once be brought to passe, it were high time to follow <hi>Tarltons</hi> aduice, to pull downe the <hi>Church,</hi> and set vp the <hi>Ale-house.</hi> And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inferiour officers would then fall to decay: amongst the rest, the poore hang-man would miscarie for want of maintenance, but let them comfort themselues, vice must be corrected, and sinne will be punished.</p>
   <p>And for the hangman me thinks I durst warrant him worke, so long as there is a Pope in <hi>Rome,</hi> or a Papist in great Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
   <p>Now for mine owne part, that haue taken vpon me to speake of so many faults, let me first manifest mine owne, I confesse I haue iested at abuse, and I haue a little scoffed at those that doe vse themselues to make a scoffe at vertue. In the setting downe whereof I haue imitated the Painter, who applieth colours but according to his picture. So in these discourses, I haue kept a Souldiers <hi>Decorum,</hi> expressing matter of little regard, with words and phrases best befitting the subiect. And where I haue to deale with more serious circumstance, I haue tempered my stile with words and tearmes thereafter.</p>
