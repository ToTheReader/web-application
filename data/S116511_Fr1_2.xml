   <head>TO ALL IVDICIALL
and indifferent Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was no meruaile that the heathen man Xenophon
willed euerie one <hi>aequalitatem colere,</hi> to honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,
seeing it serueth so much to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a ciuill life, to the managing of common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
to the conseruing of popular vnitie, which is
so excellent in comparison, so generall in comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so necessarie in all actions, that no Common wealth can doe well
without it: yet such is the error of this age, that more are readie to
confesse then to expresse this equalitie in any of their actions.</p>
   <p>There is no common weale can flourish without imposition of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
for they are as necessarie, saith Plato, as arteries or sinewes to
the bodie, but inequalitie in the sessing and rating of these charges is
but an enemie to a Commonwealth: for they are as ill as prickes or
thornes to the bodie, euerie one is willing to beare charge respectiuely
to his portion, but who can indure to be surcharged in no equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to others? there is a fit instance in one Aemilius appliable to
this purpose; who beeing complained of vnto Tyberius Caesar for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall
taxations he imposed vpon the people, T. Caesar returned this
answer, <hi>Se tondere velle suas oues non deglubere,</hi> that he would
haue him to sheare his sheepe, but not to flea them. <hi>Bruson:</hi> this saying
is worthy to be obserued of all sessors, to deale indifferently without
extremitie, and equally without partialitie in common wealth cases:
seeing vnequall rates vnder the title of vnrighteousnesse is said to be
abhomination, as well as vniust weights and measures, Deut. 25. 16.</p>
   <p>As sinne is aggrauated by circumstances, so is that iniquitie of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie:
for to deale vnequally in priuate callings, is not tollerable,
but to vse inequalitie in publike cases is farre more detestable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the iniurie is more generall, as the Schoolemen say, <hi>quanto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas
in plures extenditur tanto grauius peccat,</hi> the sinne is the
greater the more it is extended and dispersed: and therefore such as
are taken therein tardie, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> in the deede doing, or, as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians
tearme it, <hi>in flagr<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nti crimine,</hi> in the apparent fault, are to
be punished <hi>exempli causa,</hi> if it were but for example sake, that i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
might restraine the rest, according to the old Canon, <hi>Vt vnius poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>metus fit multorum,</hi> That the punishment of one might be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to many; and to this ende S. Paul saith, <hi>Them that sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
openly, that the rest also may feare,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 20. for amongst
many sinners some must be made examples.</p>
   <p>There is no man doubtes but that inequalitie hath some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and continuall current in common sessments, some that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see into it, suffer it, others that are fauoured in it, wincke at it,
those that are wronged in it, murmure at it, howsoeuer it be, they
must with patience take this pill of Virgill <hi>omnis fortuna supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa
ferendo,</hi> learne to suffer that they cannot remedie. For this
cause hauing some obiectes of inequalities offered to my eyes, I could
not forbeare my pen without impietie, considering that mellifluous
Father saith, <hi>est consentire silere cum arguere possis,</hi> to be secret
where one may say something is a sinne in consent, and to conceale
veritie <hi>est aurum sepelire</hi> is no better then to burie gould, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagrius
saith.</p>
   <p>I spleane no mans person but his vnequall proceedings, I inuey not
against common impositions and charges, but against vnequall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the taxing, I ayme not at any one man; because I speaks
generally to all, and it is a principle in all artes, He that speakes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie
speakes to none▪ when Dauid heard the generall report of
the parable; the delinquent (saith he) shall die the death; he litle
thought it concerned himselfe, vntill Nathan told him he was the
man. When Iudah heard the common clamor against Thamar; let
her be burnt, saith he, he did not suspect himselfe to be criminall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
Thamar shewed him his ring, his cloke and his staffe. Gen. 38. so
by these examples we may perceiue, that generall speeches can detect
none vnlesse he be named, though they may touch any if they be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with guilt.</p>
   <p>Such as be galled may take reformation by this and conceale it:
for I cannot saie he is the man; such as be not guiltie may take infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by this, to continue so; for it is rare to see such a man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it is pittie that so common an euill as inequalitie which
by custome is made no sinne▪ should be test vp and downe from one to an
other like a tennys ball, and passe without any check or reproofe: the
fowles of the aire will bewray. Eccles. 10. 20. the stones in the wall
will crie out. Haba. 2. 11. nay the very dumb beast will speake rather
then sinne should passe vnreprooued. 2. Pet. 2. 16.</p>
   <p>The greatest workes are sometime wrought by the weakest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
<pb facs="3"/>
as Goliah was slaine by à litle stone with á slinge, when no
cumbatant durst incounter with him, and as the Elephant is said to
be afrighted at the grunting of à pigge, so men may sometime be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and reclamed by mere trifles, and made true penitentes by the
dash of à penne, as Peter was stroke with sorrowe at the crowing of
the cocke.</p>
   <p>I desire nothing but that my penne may be as à pricke to the hartes
of the guiltie to see their faults, and that my praier may be as à
meane to haue their hartes opēed with Lydia to amend their faults:
so God shall be much glorified by their conuersion, the Agents more
esteemed by their actions, and the Author well satisfied for his
paines.</p>
