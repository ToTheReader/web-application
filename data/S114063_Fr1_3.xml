   <head>Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, and beloued in the Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many friuolous and slanderous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which our aduersaries the Papists lay vpon our Religion, this is none of the meanest, nor vnusuallest, that wee cannot be the true Church, which is as a Cittie at vnitie in it selfe, because of the manifould dissentions &amp; diuisions which are nourished amongst vs, for they thus cast in our teeth, that the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> was no sooner bred, &amp; borne, but it deuided it selfe like a Hidra into many heads: <hi>Lutherans, Caluinists, Anabaptists, Libertines, Swelckfeldians, Arians, &amp;c.</hi> which to be a mere calumniation of theirs, deuised as many other things else by them to the discredit of our religion, may appeate by many reasons, three or foure whereof I will onely propound to thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different censure in this short Epistle. First therefore their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie doth appeare in that diuerse of those sects which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as springing from <hi>Luthers</hi> roote, are none of ours, neither euer were of vs. We abhorre &amp; detest them as much, if not more then they themselues. They sprung from the Diuel, and not from <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther:</hi> to wit the <hi>Anabaptists, Libertines, Swenckfeldians</hi> and <hi>Arians:</hi> against whom both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> haue writtē expresse treatises, that the world may know how farre they were from approuing their damned errors, and how our aduersaries make no conscience of open lying and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our religion and persons, so that they may discredit vs &amp; aduantage themselues thereby. Secondly if vnity in all things be a certaine marke of the true Church, and diuision a marke of the false Church, then was there neuer true Church in the world, for there was neuer any yet in the perfect vnitie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="4"/>that in it there were not many sects and diuisions. <hi>Irenaeus an excellent</hi> and holy father, <hi>telleth vs as much</hi> when he saith: <hi>tanquam ex nucleo nucis oliuae nascitur oleaster: sic ex medio ecclesiae extiterunt hereses:</hi> that is, as from the kernell of the sweete Oliue springeth the wilde: so out of the midst of the Church springeth heresies. Thus was it in the Church of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Thessalonica</hi> and the rest to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistles, where there were many sects and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, and many exorbitant opinions touching things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: the Lords supper, and the resurrection of the body, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the second comming of the Lord, &amp;c. Likewise after and in the Apostles times, how the primatiue Church was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered with Heritikes, the Simonians, the Nicolaitans, the Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onists, the Cerinthonians and such like. Who knoweth not the like may be showne of all ages successiuely? Neither was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer such a vnity to be found in any Church vpon earth, that there were no heresies, nor opposition of opinion lurking therein. Thirdly if this be a iust exception against vs, then much more may it take hould of them, whose diuisions are both more in number and weightier in consequent then ours are, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they cannot agree whether the Pope can erre in the faith or no: nor whether the counsell be aboue the Pope: or the Pope aboue the Counsell: nor whether a man may be certaine of his standing in the state of grace or no. All matters of great moment. Againe it is notoriously knowne to all men, how the Iesuites and secular Priests differ in iudgement about the Popes coactiue power in the temporall affaires of Princes: and how of elder yeares their diuinitie was diuided into three families, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, Scotists, Occamists: Thomas</hi> against <hi>Scot,</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> against <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Occam</hi> against both. And againe who knoweth not, how the Romish doctors differ in iudgement about the vow of single life, the lent fast, &amp; auricular confessiō; whether these be of diuine institution or ecclesiasticall onely, as also about mariage after diuors, originall sinne, and the conception of the Virgin Mary: about all these matters there is such contention amongst them, and oftentimes with such bitternesse, that they
<pb facs="4"/>would euen seeme to deuour one another. Lastly it is a wonder to see with how many idle controuersies their doctrine of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation is enwrapped, one houlding this, another that, &amp; scarce two of them agreeing all things, the verse is well knowne which I shall heere set downe: <hi>Corpore de Christi lis est, de sanguine lis est: Lis est de modo, non habitura modum.</hi> If varietie of opinions now marre the forme of a Church, then is their Church vtterly spoyled. and put out of fashion, rather then ours, wherein for one controuersie with vs, there are tenne with them (I dare bouldly auouch) and those of no trifles but of main points of their Religion. Lastly if we consider aright the diuisions that are in our Church betwixt the <hi>Caluinists</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> we shall easely perceaue that they are both few in quantitie and in qualitie, such as ouerthrow no fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall article of the faith: And this to be so, this short treatise will plainely and briefely discouer vnto thee, if thou please to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow but an houre or two reading vpon it.</p>
   <p>The Authors thereof are Germanes, the translator a man not professing schollership, but exercised in traficke of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and therefore thou in wisedome wilt accept his wholesome bunch of Rhenish grapes, though clad with a plain and easie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of homespun thred. I am perswaded that his zeale to Gods Church, and his loue to the peace of Zion moued him to vndertake this taske, and in my iudgement this his good intent cannot but in some measure take some good effect, for this short tract may serue thee for three excellent purposes: First to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the malice of our Romish aduersaries, who by mustering vp our diuisions, would faine proue vs to haue no veritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, because we haue no vnitie: whereas our differences are here made manifest to be not many in number, nor of anie great moment, that is such as concerne the wals and windowes of our faith, but not the foundation. Secondly thou maist also here take view what the maine differences are betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Caluinists,</hi> that thou maist be able to iudge how the vnitie of faith is not broken betwixt them, and that both ioine together in the seruice of one Christ, and against his
<pb facs="5"/>great enemie Antichrist. And Lastly it may serue also, as a meanes to calm the heat of the moderne quarrels in our Church, which haue beene pursued on both partes, with too too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of spirit: for here both sides may learne this wholesome and short lesson, that seeing they builde vpon one foundation, therefore though they meete not in opinion, yet they would meete in brotherly loue: and laying aside all rancour and violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, ioine their forces against the common aduersarie. And this is the principall drift of this short discourse.</p>
   <p>Now the God of peace sāctisie vs al throughout both in body, soule and spirit, that they may bee kept blamelesse to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Iesus: and giue vs grace that wee may hould fast the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
