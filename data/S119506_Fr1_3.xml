      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING vndertaken at the request of the English Colledge of this Citty and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers theire benefactors and frendes, to write this Relation, of the Intertaynment &amp; good successe of theire Magesties coming to this Colledge wherat I was present: the same beeing to the great comfort of these banished Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the same nation, and of many other graue and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages of this kingdome, who for the great affection and good wil they beare to this Colledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to haue particular notice of all that passed: I thought my labour herein should be the more approued and the Relation more gratefull to all sortes of people, both here and in England, if it passed first through your highnes handes, aswell for the naturall affection which this Kingdome beareth you, as also for the singular loue your highnes in many ocasions hath shewed in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes past to the Catholikes of Englād, which no doubte
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
by this late vicinetie and neighbourhood is much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, whereof this Relation shal be to them a newe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and testimonie, and so I truste of your highnes cle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mencie, that you will vouchsafe to make them partakers of this cōforte, in confidēce whereof I haue entered into many party cularities and taken ocasiō to speake of diuers circumstāces which wil not be tedious to your highnes, nor to the discreete reader with this respecte. And al though I could haue desired more tyme &amp; comoditie for the writinge of any thinge that should be presented to your highnes, yet cōsidering that the grace and ornamēt of this kinde of narration is the noueltie and freshnes it bringes, I haue rather chosen to packe it vp in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste, as my other businesses and obligations did permitte, then to delaye it any longer, hoping that amongste the fauours which your highnes hath shewed and doth dayly shewe to these Seminaries one shal be and not the least, to accepte the good will and intention of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and not looke vpon the errors of the stile or other faultes that may be comitted.</p>
   <p>This whole Cittie is greatly comforted with the good newes that comes dayly of the discreet and Christiā zeale &amp; valour which your highnes sheweth in all occasiōs, &amp; so doth ernestly beseech our Sauiour (who giueth you them) that he will defende and prosper your highnes for many happie yeares, &amp; the Arch duke in like manner, for the good of Christendome, to whome I suppose this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wil not be vngratefull. So wishing your highnesses all fortunate successe I humbly take my leaue from the English Colledge in Valladolid the 15. of Septemb. 1600.</p>
