Nothing there is at all, which may deserue the Printing: but if any thing there be, which any wayes may auaile the soules good; the Lord Print that in the Heart: which is all I ayme at, or can desire. I hope it will be offence to none, but to such onely who put the gaine of Deceit into a broken Bagge (for whom I passe not) that our Prophets In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue against the scant measure, wicked Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances,
<pb facs="4"/>and the bagge of deceitfull weights, is renued in these times, and some of the Citie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners not exempted from it: which Discipline in time (no doubt) will redresse and purge; That glorious things may euer bee spoken of thee,<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>87.</hi>
      </note> thou Citie of God: and the Lord may still loue the habitations of <hi>Iacob,</hi> where his Name is called vpon, and his will obserued. Thus seeke wee still the peace of our Hierusalem, breaking off our sinnes by repentance, being at peace with God; that the God of peace and loue, may establish for euer peace within our Walles, and set plenty within our Palaces, to his glory, and the comfort of vs all in Christ Iesus.</p>
