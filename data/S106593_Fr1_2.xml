   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE WILLIAM, Earle of PENBROOKE, Lord <hi>Harbert,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> of the High and Mighty Prince King CHARLES the first of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> his Honorable houshold: one of the <hi>Lords of his Maiesties most honorable privie Councell, Chancellor of the Vniversity of</hi> Oxford, Knight of the most Noble order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. <hi>George Ienney</hi> Gent: wisheth all true noble honor in this life, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and glory, in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble Lord, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you, that you would not count it presumptuous bodlnes, in me a man so meanly qualified, to dedicate a Booke to you, so Noble a personage; the zeale of Gods glorious truth, and the honor I beare to this visible Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> wherein, I had not onely my first being in an estate of corrupted nature; but in Gods good time, haue by his blessing on his owne ordinance, and my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereunto, given me my better being in a state of
<pb facs="3"/> grace, wherein I stand: the zeale I say vnto Gods truth, and the honour I beare to this Church, that professeth and preacheth this truth, hath provoked me to this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The subiect of this discourse, is the Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and invisible; and for as much, as I finde by reading some Bookes of controversies, betweene the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and our Church, the great abuses which the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offer to our holy Religion, and our Church, that preacheth and professeth the same: and for as much as our Romish English Catholikes, will haue no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with vs, in our publike assemblies: I thought it fitt in my Christian charitie toward them, being grieved to see them seduced by their hereticall corrupted teachers. To write this Dialogue, as a private conference with them, or so many of them, as this poore Dialogue by Gods providence may come vnto. Right Honorable, I beseech you, not to be discouraged, because I am no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Schollar, to vouchsafe your Lordships patronage of this meane worke, for after I had finished it, I would not adventure to procure the publishing of it, before I had obteyned the judgement of judicious Divines, touching the worth of it. There was three or foure about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that perused it, and subscribed their approbations to the originall coppy, affirming, that it was like to do that good, for which it was intended: which did incourage me to obtaine licence to publish it, and dedicate it vnto your Lordship. I am vnknowne vnto your Honor, yet I haue received favours from you, for I was sometime a servitor in Court, in the time of our Great Master, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, the Heroicall Princes, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Queene <hi>Ann,</hi> Father and Mother to our deare Soveraign, King <hi>Charles;</hi> whose servant I was, and served as a Gentleman Sewer
<pb facs="3"/> of her Maiesties chamber in ordinary. At which time, your Honourable favours to mee, with the rest of the Queenes servants aboue the stayres especially, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence waiters was such, that I cannot be altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindefull, and therefore in this regard, I am especially bound vnto your Lordship, and doe offer this poore worke to you in thankefullnes. But this is not the cheife cause, of my dedicating these my poore endevours vnto you, but because I know you are a lover of Gods truth, which is your greatest honor: your Christian Noble car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this church, doth evidētly demonstrate the same. And therefore I presume that this little mite of mine, will be rather furthered then hindered from the Church, that it may remaine in the Treasury of this our Church, for the edification of poore weake and ignorant soules, that are already, or may be in possibilitie, to be seduced for want of knowledge in Gods truth, and the true Church, which teach, preach, and professe the same: Some there be that liue in the bosome of our Church, that are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perswaded, that our Church, is a pure part of the visible Catholike Church, and spouse of Christ; this may be a meanes further to confirme them. And some there be that are weake, and infirme, wavering minded, and ready to fall from our Church, and from the saving faith, which is faithfully preached and professed by her. This may be a meanes by Gods blessing, to strengthen them, and many there be, that are alienated from our Church, and that saving faith taught by her, and haue knit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they liue in a false faith, grounded on a false foundatiō, this may be a means, to giue them to vnderstand that they are schismatically, and erroniously departed from our Church, and the true
<pb facs="4"/> faith, preached and professed by her; and a meanes to draw them to repentance, by turning to our Church and the truth therein faithfully taught, which is the spirituall milke, for the nourishmēt of their soules vnto everlasting life, from the false Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled vp in er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or, superstitiō, and idolatry, to their eternal perdition, if they repent not. I haue shewed them, that the Church, is to be considered two wayes, as it is visible, and as it is invisible: and that as it is invisible, it is truely, properly, and indeede, the Church of Christ. I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, how this invisible Church, is his body, how it is invisible, how it is spirituall, how it is mysticall, and how it is the Catholike Church wee professe to beleeue in the Creede; and I haue shewed them, the happy and blessed estate of this Church, and the severall members thereof: First, in this life. Secondly, in their death. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the resurrection. Fourthly, at the day of Iudgement. And lastly, after Iudgement for ever, so farre forth as I can gather by Gods word, &amp; the ministery of our church, and I haue shewed them lastly, how a true converted child of God, may be assured, that he is a member of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and blessed body and Church of Christ. The second part of this Booke, consists of the visible Church, where I haue first defined it, in which definition, is conteined the essence of it, in the matter and forme. I haue shewed the infallible markes of a visible true Church, whereby a private man may know it: and I haue shewed the marks that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth to be infallible, but I haue proved them to be deceitfull, if they be not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the true doctrine of salvation. I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the truth of our Church, and that theirs is a false Church by their owne markes, that is to say, Succession,
<pb facs="4"/> Antiquity, Vnity, Sanctity, Miracles, &amp;c. And therein is inserted divers doctrines of the word and workes of God, worthy of note, which I thought good to shew them, that they might the better conceiue what the Church is, and whereof it doth consist, of which they are greatly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And my good Lord, whereas there is not in the world, the least Creature which God hath made, but will adde vnto mans perfection, either for knowledge, or for vse somewhat; so this poore worke of mine, although it doth not adde vnto your Lordships wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet it may ratifie and confirme it in many things, if your Honour will vouchsafe the reading of it: Herein is shewed the true succession of the Church, in all ages of the world from <hi>Adam,</hi> till this very day, and that our Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doth succeede the ancient Churches; both in the time of nature before the writing of the Law, and vnder the Law, as the Church of the Iewes; and the Church of CHRIST since the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell: and that it doth succeede them all, in that which is essentiall to the Church, both in the foundation, and also in the matter and forme: These things I shew more at large, in this ensuing Dialogue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which I now present vnto your Lordship, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Honour, to accept the minde of the giver, and peruse it at your leisure. And thus I commend you Right Honourable, to the protection, and grace of God in Christ.</p>
