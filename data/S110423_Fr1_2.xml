   <head>TO THE RIGHT VVOR<seg rend="sup">shipfull,</seg> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> of Hough, in the Countie of Chester, Knight; <hi>Francis Pilkington</hi> Batchelor of Musicke, and Lutenist, wisheth all happines in this life, and eternall felicity in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, there is held an infallible opinion, that the sacred Art of <hi>Musicke</hi> (being chiefly illustrated by Voyces) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all Artists, in respect of the compasse and quality of voyces and instruments, doe limit it within scales and other certaine dimensions, is in it owne nature INFINITE; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the base Earth (being as it were the GAM-VT or ground) to the highest E. LA. of the incomprehensible hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: For demonstration whereof, GOD to his great Glory, doth diuersly and wonderfully enable his creatures thereunto, teaching man vpon earth, not onely in mellifluous Notes to chant; but also vpon variety of Instruments sweetly to expresse the hidden secrets of that sacred Science, &amp; not leauing the vast Ayre empty of his glory; he instructeth the early Larke to warble forth his prayse; who, (as some hould) learneth his layes from the musicall motions of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spheares, and from thence to transcend vp to the seate of the most highest, the elected Saints and Angels doe in heauenly Himmes, sing perpetually <hi>Te deum</hi> to the holy Trinitie, sitting on the Throne of most Maiesticke glorie.</p>
   <p>In which quality of Musicke (Right worshipfull) hauing spent a great part of my time, I haue now (after some others) of late produced this small peece of worke; which albeit for the insufficiency thereof, I doe hold to be too vnworthie to be presented to your Worship, yet in regarde of the many and manifold fauors, which I haue receiued at your hands, and your exquisit skill, both in the Theorique and Practique of that excellent Art; I doe presume to tender it to your Patronage and protection, chusing rather to be censured for ouer-boldnesse, then to be taxed with ingratitude or forgetfulnesse. And so humbly desiring your Worship to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this, and to shield it from all pragmaticall and stigmaticall detractors; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till my best skill and endeauour, shall incite my weake Muse to performe some worke of better worth, I craue pardon for my bouldnesse, and commit your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the good Lady your wife, to the blessed tuition of the GOD of Israell.</p>
