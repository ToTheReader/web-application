   <head>A Preface to the noble <hi>Poets of Englande.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the innumerable sortes of Englyshe Bookes, and infinite fardles of printed pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets; wherewith thys Countrey is peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all shoppes stuffed, and euery study fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: the greatest part I thinke in any one kinde, are such as are either meere Poeticall, or which tende in some respecte (as either in matter or forme) to Poetry. Of such Bookes therfore, sith I haue beene one, that haue had a desire to reade not the fewest, and because it is an argument, which men of great learning haue no leysure to handle, or at the least hauing to doo with more serious matters doo least regarde: If I write something, concerning what I thinke of our English Poets, or aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to sette downe my simple iudgement of English Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrie, I trust the learned Poets will giue me leaue, and vouchsafe my Booke passage, as beeing for the rudenesse thereof no preiudice to their noble studies, but euen (as my intent is) an <hi>instar cotis</hi> to stirre vppe some other of meete abilitie, to bestowe trauell in this matter: whereby I thinke wee may not onelie get the meanes which wee yet want, to discerne betweene good writers and badde, but perhappes also challenge from the rude multitude of rusticall Rymers, who will be called Poets, the right prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and orderly course of true Poetry.</p>
   <p>It is to be wondred at of all, and is lamented of manie, that where as all kinde of good learning, haue aspyred to royall dignitie and statelie grace in our English tongue, being not onelie founded, defended, maintained, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, but also purged from faultes, weeded of errours, &amp; pollished from barbarousnes, by men of great authoritie
<pb facs="5"/>
and iudgement: onelie Poetrie hath founde fewest frends to amende it, those that can, reseruing theyr skyll to thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, those that cannot, running headlong vppon it, thinking to garnish it with their deuises, but more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting it with fantasticall errours. VVhat shoulde be the cause, that our English speeche in some of the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest mens iudgements, hath neuer attained to anie suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ripenes, nay not ful auoided the reproch of barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Poetry? the rudenes of the Countrey, or basenesse of wytts: or the course <hi>Dialect</hi> of the speeche? experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vtterlie disproueth it to be anie of these: what then? surelie the canckred enmitie of curious custome: which as it neuer was great freend to any good learning, so in this hath it grounded in the most, such a negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of an impossibilitie in matching the best, that the finest witts and most diuine heades, haue contented them selues with a base kinde of fingering: rather debasing theyr faculties, in setting forth theyr skyll in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest manner, then for breaking custome, they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to adorne their Countrey and aduaunce their style with the highest &amp; most learnedst toppe of true Poetry. The rudenes or vnaptnesse of our Countrey to be either none or no hinderaunce, if reformation were made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie, the exquisite excellency in all kindes of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nowe flourishing among vs, inferiour to none other nation, may sufficiently declare.</p>
   <p>That there be as sharpe and quicke wittes in England, as euer were among the peerelesse Grecians, or renowmed Romaines, it were a note of no witte at all in me to deny. And is our speeche so course, or our phrase so harshe, that Poetry cannot therein finde a vayne whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare like it selfe? why should we think so basely of this? rather then of her sister, I meane Rethoricall <hi>Eloquution,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
which as they were by byrth Twyns, by kinde the same, by originall of one descent: so no doubt, as Eloquence hath founde such fauourers, in the English tongue, as she frequenteth not any more gladly so would Poetrye if there were the like welcome and entertainment gyuen her by our English Poets, without question aspyre to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull perfection and appeare farre more gorgeous and delectable among vs. Thus much I am bolde to say in behalfe of Poetrie, not that I meane to call in question the reuerend and learned workes of Poetrie, written in our tongue by men of rare iudgement, and most excellent Poets: but euen as it were by way of supplication to the famous and learned Lawre<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t Masters of Englande, that they would but consult one halfe howre with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Muse, what credite they might winne to theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speeche, what enormities they might wipe out of English Poetry, what a fitte vaine they might frequent, wherein to shewe forth their worthie faculties: if Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Poetrie were truely reformed, and some perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme or <hi>Prosodia</hi> of versifying were by them ratifyed and sette downe: eyther in immitation of Greekes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or where it would skant abyde the touch of theyr Rules, the like obseruations selected and established by the naturall affectation of the speeche. Thus much I say, not to perswade you that are the fauourers of Englishe Poetry but to mooue it to you: beeing not the firste that haue thought vpō this matter, but one that by cōsent of others, haue taken vppon me to lay it once again in your wayes, if perhaps you may stumble vppon it, and chance to looke so lowe from your diuine cogitations, when your Muse mounteth to the starres, and ransacketh the Spheres of heauen: whereby perhaps you may take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of noble Poetry, pittifullie mangled and defaced,
<pb facs="6"/>
by rude smatterers and barbarous immitatours of your worthy studies. If the motion bee worthy your regard it is enough to mooue it, if not, my wordes woulde sim, ply preuaile in perswading you, and therefore I rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thys onely request, that of your courtesies, you wyll graunt passage, vnder your fauourable corrections, for this my simple censure of English Poetry, wherein if you please to runne it ouer, you shall knowe breefely myne opinion of the most part of our accustomed Poets, and particularly in his place, the lyttle somewhat which I haue sifted out of my weake brayne concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thys reformed verfifying.</p>
