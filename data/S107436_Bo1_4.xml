   <head>The preface of the Translatour vnto the third Oration of Morall instructions, written by that famous and learned Oratour Isocrates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the discourse made by Nicocles king of Salamis vnto his people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed by the Authour Nicocles.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue hard howe and after what sort Isocrates in his former treatise hath instructed, and taught Nicocles the king of Salamis in all those things which he thought necessarie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for the Maiestie of a Prince, as also for euery other Magistrate, to whom the charge of the common weale should happen to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the whole effect thereof, almost consisting in this one onely point, that is, that they should indeuour, as farre to excell and surpasse all other their inferiours in vertue and knowledge, as they doe exceede them in degree and authoritie, seeking immortall praise through their well doinges and godly gouernments. Now in the third Oration is declared &amp; expressed, in like sort the duetie of all true subiectes and faithfull Citizens to bee vsed, and obserued towardes their Princes and gouernours: and this is expressed, as it were by Nicocles himselfe speaking vnto his Nobles and courteours, and to the rest of his people, worthie to be read, perused and followed, of all those which are desirous to shewe themselues faithfull, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent subiectes vnto their most gratious gouernesse, not forgetting dayly and hourely to yeeld most hartie thankes vnto the vnspeakeable goodnesse and mercie of God, in sending vs so carefull and so louing a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Israell: vvhose most gratious raigne the Lord of his goodnesse both prosper and continue, in most happie and blessed wise ouer vs, to the confirmation
<pb n="31" facs="43"/>
and establishing of his truth, to her Maiesties endlesse praise, and to the perpetuall comfort and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vs all. The order obserued by the Authour in this Oration, consisteth in three partes, the first his entraunce or beginning, containing the defence of Eloquence, with the reproofe of those lewde, and euill disposed persons, partly expressed in the conclusion of the former Oration. The second part is as touching the state of a monarchie or gouernment of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnder one man alone, as is the rule and dignitie of an Emperour or king: herein confirming the right &amp; title which Nicocles had vnto the kingdome which he then possessed and enioyed. The thirde and last, comprehendeth and containeth the duetie of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes towardes their princes, with a briefe conclusion annexed therevnto. But chiefely and principally I would wishe all true Christians, liuing in these daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous dayes (wherein sinne and iniquitie seeme to haue the vpper hand, the diuell seeking by all meanes possible to ouerthrowe the truth of gods word by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising of them to lewdnesse and licentiousnesse of life, to whom the charge thereof is committed) to marke and consider the first part of this discourse, applying the same as a salue to their troubled consciences, not misliking or condemning the true and sincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods worde, agreeable to his Gospell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the euill liues, and lewde dealinges of them who are the preachers and ministers of the same: for as our Authour prooueth, that the studie of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not to be misliked or condemned, because diuers abuse the same, neither yet any other good gift to be dispraised, in that some haue applyed it to an euill purpose: so surely we are not to mislike or to iudge of the veritie of Gods Booke by the outwarde dealinges and workes of men, as condemning the Sermons and preachinges of them whose wordes are not repugnant vnto the veritie, because hauing prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="44"/>
to others they themselues become reprobates, but we ought rather to pray to the Lord for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and to flie vnto his deputie our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Queene, together with her most honorable Counsell that sincere discipline might be admitted, vsed and ordered without respect of persons, that all other inferiour Magistrates to whom any charge is committed, would be more carefull of their charge, more circumspect in their dealinges, as men more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the performaunce of their dueties the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Countrie, the rooting out of sinne and iniquitie with a feruent desire, to the aduauncing of vertue and planting of a godly conuersation in all men then either for feare of displeasure to become fearefull through fauour or affection, to be men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall or for the sparing of their pursses, auoyding of trouble, or taking of paynes to be found in any thing seduced, contrarie to the nature of a good man, and that euerye one of vs perticulerly might haue that grace as to looke into our owne consciences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our owne faultes, and speedily to amend that which we shall finde as amisse in our selues and so shall wee bee sure that according to the promise of him which is the onely truth, and neuer suffereth any one to be denied in so iust a petition, that these cobwebs which so trouble vs, shall at length be swept away that all such mystes as seeme to darken the brightnesse of his glory shall to our great comfort vanishe and be exhausted as vapours, and that all tares and darnells shall be so cleanly selected and sifted from the pure corne, that I doubt not but euery Englishe man shall as boldly say of this our Countrie, as did Leonidas of Sparta, namely, that euery man doth so carefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himselfe to the fulfilling of his duetie that there is not one that liueth licentiously, the which the Lord of his infinite goodnesse and mercy graunt vs. And thus gentle Reader, as one not appointing the Lord a

time, but patiently abyding his pleasure, framing thy will to his, vsing this medicine as the onely salue to cure all thy diseases, wishing thee by the approoued reasons and pithie argumentes of this Panim to bee perswaded from so fond an errour, adioyning my selfe as a copartner with thee in the same, I will giue leaue to the Authour himselfe to vtter his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion vnto thee, the which I pray God thou maist both diligently marke and alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
