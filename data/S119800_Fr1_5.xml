VVherein is set downe at length the whole matter and nature of diet for those in health, but especially for the sicke; the aire, and other elements; meat and drinke, with divers other things; various controversies concerning this subject are discussed: besides many pleasant practicall and historicall relations, both of the authours owne and other mens, &amp;c. as by the argument of each booke, the contents of the chapters, and a large table, may easily appeare. Colellected [sic] as well out of the writings of ancient philosophers, Greeke, Latine, and Arabian, and other moderne writers; as out of divers other authours.

   <head>The Introduction to this VVHOLE DISCOVRSE; VVherein is detected the lawlesse intrusion of many ignorant Persons upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <hi>of</hi> PHYSICKE.</head>

      <hi>Hippocrates, vita brevis, ars longa:</hi> the life of man is but short, and Arts and Sciences are long and hard to be attained unto: I thought it alwaies the part of a wise man to apply his study to that which might prove most profitable, either for his owne private, or yet for the publike. And if ever this was usefull, this age wherein we now live requireth this care and circumspection. The multitude of needlesse and unprofitable pamphlets,<note place="margin">Multitude of idle and superfluous pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets printed.</note> that I say no worse, wee see daily to pester the Printers Presses, in such sort, that it were to be wished there might be some restraint and limitation, and not every man at his pleasure suffered to vent the idle fancies of a selfe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted braine; so farre many times from doing any good, either in Church or Common-wealth, that they prove rather the causes of a great deale of mischiefe. <hi>Scribimus indocti, docti{que} poemata passim.</hi> But I let passe that which is not in my power to amend, and come to the matter now in hand. Some few yeeres agoe, I stepped forth also my selfe upon the stage to act some part of mine owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. There I detected and laid open some errours and impostures practised by some ignorant practitioners of physicke in that <note n="*" place="margin">Semioticall part of physicke handleth the signes of diseases, as well diagnosticke as prognosticke.</note>
      <hi>Semioticall</hi> part of this profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which treateth of urine. Now <hi>Ille ego qui quondam gracili modulatus avena, Carmen, &amp;c.</hi> I have now undertaken the handling of an higher taske, to wit, that part of the <note n="¶" place="margin">
         <p>Therapeuticall part of physicke, is that which is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about the cure of diseases.</p>
         <p>Diet of the Diseased hath been much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Physitians.</p>
      </note>
      <hi>Therapeuticke</hi> part of physicke, which handleth the diet of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased, which of all other parts of physicke hath most slightly and slenderly beene past over; and that as well by the antient, as by our moderne and late Writers. And since the diet of sound and healthfull people hath beene handled by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude both of antient and late Writers, both in forraine countries, and here at home amongst our selves; it is a wonder that the diet of the diseased, who of all others have most neede, hath hitherto so farre beene neglected! Having therefore a long time waited for my elders and better skilled in this businesse, and perceiving that no man opened his mouth in the behalfe of the diseased, I tooke upon mee to say something, rather than to be altogether silent. And so much the more was I animated and incouraged to set upon this subject, in that I saw it so generally neglected, or at least, most grossely abused, which notwithstanding, was so carefully among the antients observed, as shall hereafter in the sequell of this discourse more plainly appeare.</p>
   <p>And daily experience doth plainely prove, that a small error committed,<note place="margin">A small errour in diet much preiudiceth the patient.</note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
in the due quantity, in the quality, in the time, or any other such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, proveth not a little prejudiciall to the patient. And I my selfe have in my daily practice observed this to be true, that aliments of the best nature and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, yet taken but at an unseasonable time, as toward the time of the exacerbation of the <hi>Fever,</hi> called the <hi>Paroxysme,</hi> and by the vulgar the fit; hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made the patient confesse, that <hi>sweet meate had sowre sauce.</hi> And from hence may be evinced,<note place="margin">Erroneous practice of the vulgar, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally womē in feeding the sicke too much.</note> the erroneous practice of many, of women especially, who think the sicke hath never food enough; and for this purpose they never cease to urge them to eat, morning and evening, night and day, all is one, their too too officious love and kindnesse, having neither rime nor reason, as wee say, produceth often this contrary effect, that, according to the vulgar saving, <hi>They kill their friend with kindnesse.</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Jmpura corpora quo magis nutris eo magis laedit, <hi>Aph. 8. lib.</hi>
      </note> That famous Father of Physitians was of a farre other minde, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that uncleane bodies, the more they were nourished, the more they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And the same <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was so punctuall in prescribing the exact pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and severall circumstances of the diet in acute diseases of his daies, that from thence appeareth the exact care was had in those daies of the diet of the diseased, as may by divers places of his writings, appeare. The like care had that noble <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Celsus</hi> among the <hi>Latines,</hi> and not unjustly called the <hi>Latine Hippocrates,</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth the great care he hd even in this particular point. And this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care of theirs was the cause they had a certaine kind of Physitians among them, whose proper office and imploiment was,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Clinici,</hi> or bed-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, who attended on the sicke.</note> to assist the sicke, observing all that passed about them, having an especiall care that the diet prescribed by the chiefe Physitian, were carefully observed, all being afterwards related to him when he came to visit the sicke; and these inferiour assistant Physitians were for this cause called <hi>Clinici,</hi> from their office of attending by the sickes bed; as in the second booke of this discourse shall more plainely appeare. By the variety of things to be considered, even in the diet of the diseased (which now notwithstanding is accounted a thing of small or no esteeme) may appeare the great care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection ought to be had in the choice of a Physitian with whom thou maist safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be trust thy most pretious and costly jewell, thy life, I meane. And therefore kinde Reader, give me leave a little, to say something concerning some errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ignorant practitioners, before I proceed further, they being so dangerous members in a wel-governed commonwealth. Most of those persons are stiled by this generall name of <hi>Emperick,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <p>Emperickes and their kindes.</p>
         <p>What an Emperick is.</p>
      </note> which drawes its denomination from experience, and is againe subdivided into many other branches: as the <hi>Empericke</hi> properly so called, <hi>Women Physitians, Surgeons, ignorant Apothecaries, fugitive Physitians, Mountebankes, Quack-salvers, Epehmerides-masters,</hi> and many more of this stamp. Now, an <hi>Empericke</hi> is nothing else but such a person as undertaketh the practice of this profession by meanes of some receits, or traditionary medicines, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, perhaps, sometimes not without a successefull event adhibited; and at the first with good advice and counsell prescribed for the solace of the sicke: yet now being used by such persons, who are altogether strangers to good education in the liberall Arts &amp; Sciences, and especially unfurnished of that skil and sufficiency required in the practice of this so sacred and sublime profession of Physicke; in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of wholesome and laudable medicines, be come now not only dangerous, but often desperate and often the bane of such as use them, howsoever not alwaies for the time so sensibly perceived. This sort of practitioner rejecteth the inquisit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diseases and remedies according to their causes, natures and qualities agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to true reason and understanding; and satisfieth himselfe with such things as often occurre evident and manifest unto sense, and his ordinary experience. And therefore the <hi>Empe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ick</hi> erreth, in that he is derived of true method and a rationall proceeding according to the rules and principles of art in his practice; without the which hee can never be able to manage the diseases of the sicke, and to bring them to a hopefull and successefull issue, unlesse now and then by accident, which is never without great danger, as the learned are well able to understand.

      </note> howsoever among practitioners, some may seem to have attaind to some higher pitch of understanding than others, yet because they abuse right reason, they ought
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
not to be inrolled in the ranke of right and rationall Physitians; and by consequent ought not to be suffered to practise this sublime profession. Now, amongst our ordinary <hi>Emperickes,</hi> wee reckon the ordinary <hi>Mountebanke</hi> and <hi>Quackesalver,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mountebanks, Quack salvers, fugitive Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians.</note> or <hi>fugitive Physitian</hi> changing oftener than the Moone, their severall seats and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, often hanging out their flagges and banners, promising indifferently the cure of all diseases. And of this stamp was a certaine <hi>Germane,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Historie of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Mountebanke.</note> who within these few yeeres set up his briefes in this towne, wherein hee bragged of a rare water, able to cure all <hi>Consumptions</hi> whatsoever; and would bring a weake stomacke, that before was scarce able to digest any sustenance, within a few daies to that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and strength, that it should be able to digest a whole shoulder of mutton at a meale. And such another was another of that same nation two or three yeeres before him, who put out so many eyes in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> and other places:<note place="margin">Another of the same stamp.</note> and surely, I thinke they had but a blinde understanding that would trust such a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And yet some of the <hi>Gentrie,</hi> who would have taken it in great scorne to be called fooles, swallowed downe such govions; in this verifying that old saying to be true, <hi>Mundus vult decipi:</hi> But they paied well for their experience, and I hope it will make some wiser the next time. Some of them againe,<note place="margin">Trauelling Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.</note> without any such publike shew or ostentation, travell to and fro, bragging of great wonders they have done; and if perhaps, they have but once cured, although it may be, but in shew, some infected with the <hi>Neapolitan French catholike</hi> (or how you list to call it) disease, by some Mercuriat inunction or otherwise, this is sufficient to make such an <hi>Aesculapius</hi> dare to attempt any thing after. Such an ubiquitary Physitian was that, who few yeeres agoe had almost perswaded a Gentleman of <hi>Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> then irrecoverably sicke of that sort of <hi>Consumption,</hi>
      <note place="margin">History of a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Quacksalver.</note> which Physitians call an ulcer of the lungs, and well known by the judicious artist to be of hard recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where there is not wanting the best care and diligence of the most industrious and understanding cleere-sighted Physitians; and that even before the disease be radicated and habituated within the body: much more then in the decay of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vigour and strength, accompanied with an <note n="f" place="margin">Faciet Hippocraticae est hujusmodi: Nares acutae, ocu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </note> Hippocraticall face, as Physitians commonly call it. Vnto this Gentleman then (my presence being at that time sollicited for a neighbour Gentlewoman in the same towne, not farre from <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) was I intreated to repaire, where upon my first comming, I acquainted his wife and friends there present, with the danger, which threatned no lesse than death to the patient, whom a neighbouring Parson-Physitian had a long time before had under his cure. Now, a few daies before my comming, this fugitive <hi>Aesculapius</hi> had soothed up both this Gentleman and his friends with a vaine hope of a supposed true cure, by meanes of some consolidating balsames, which this cogging and coozening Quacke-salver assured him and his friends would undoubtedly cure his infirmity. The bargaine was tenne pounds, five in hand (for monie must first be fingered) to buy such balsames at <hi>London,</hi> and the rest at his returne. And although here a meane and ordinary understanding, might, as wee use to say, <hi>smell out a Ratt;</hi> yet such was the confidence, desire, and hope of health, that if I had not with much adoe disswaded him from this course, whereunto he was likewise perswaded by an Apothecary of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with his life, hee had lost his mony also. My prediction of his death within a few daies revolution proved too true, as I learned shortly after by relation from a worthy vertuous Lady in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> my patient, and mother to this Gentlemans wife. I instance in this particular, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how farre people are often deluded, and even, as it were, bewitched with these maskes and vizards, shewes and shadowes without any substance, and where there is no lesse danger than of life it selfe. But wee need not now goe farre, either into <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>France</hi> to fetch <hi>Emperickes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Emperickes abound with us here at home.</note> they being here every where obvious and at our elbowes; and scarce any towne or corporation of any note or fame, but there are one, if not more of this sort of counterfeit Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: and how many of these supposed Physitians of both sexes lie skouting in corners of the famous Citie of <hi>London,</hi> the Colledge there can tell. Amongst these lawlesse intruders there is one sort that is growne to a saucie and arrogant
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
impudencie beyond many others, Surgeons I meane; who from curing of green wounds, outward vlcers and sores, curing of the Pox by sweating or saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Surgeons commonly too saucy and bold in practising physicke.</note> by Mercuriat inunctions, and some such other ministeriall offices, which Physitians (Surgery being but a ministeriall part of physicke) for the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of their function, have resigned to certaine persons to practise. But it is now so come to passe, that in many places, the servant hath rebelled against the Master, and affirmed all unto himselfe: as is reported, that sometimes those slaves of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> rebelled against the <hi>Sultan</hi> their Soveraigne, and assumed unto themselves the Diadem Royall.</p>
   <p>And whereas the learned Physitian, in regard of the extraordinary care and diligence required both in his private study, and assiduall paines about his sicke patients,<note place="margin">Surgeons are onely deputed for the cure of externall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> be trusted the Surgeon with this externall part of physicke, reserving unto himselfe the curing of internall diseases, being of greatest moment and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and withall reserving unto himselfe a right of direction and counsell in these externall cures: it is now, notwithstanding, so come to passe, that any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant apprentize in this profession, if he hath but once besmeared some <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> patient with his Mercuriat ointment, thinkes himselfe suddenly matamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed into some famous Physitian. And if hee hath made a voiage into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> or some other remote region (where, for want of better counsell, those of the company are often cast upon such ordinary advice; their ordinary infirmities notwithstanding, for the most part being the <hi>Scorbut</hi> and <hi>Calenture</hi>) he thinkes at his returne he may be allowed to kill his country-men: and not with this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will not faile to bring up others in the same ignorant impudency. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the learned Physitian, if hee would wait upon such imployments, were as fit, if not fitter than some of themselves to goe about such businesse; yet, for the care he hath of the other, being the more weighty, and where most diligence is required, is willing to relinquish this manuall operation: yet is the impudent audacity of many of our Surgeons such, that although they come farre short of many points of their owne profession; yet are they not ashamed to assume unto themselves the profession and practice of both these parts. <hi>De jure,</hi> now let the learned judge. Of the better and more ingenious sort of Barber-Surgeons of the famous Citty of <hi>London,</hi> and some other places of this Kingdome I speake not, who are so farre from this unlawfull and lawlesse practice; that they are both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to admit of the counsell of the learned Physitian, as well for diet, as for other directions tending to the recovery of their patients, even in points of their owne particular profession, wherein they might yet seeme to challenge to themselves some better right: so farre are they from incroaching upon the Physitians freehold, as knowing themselves unfit &amp; unfurnished for so great and waighty an imploiment. And this is likewise the custome in that famous Citty in <hi>Paris,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Laudable custome of those places where the Surgeon taketh no great cure of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> and many other places of that Kingdome, that a Surgeon (I meane of the best note, not a bold impudent audacious fellow, daring do any thing) seldome or never undertaketh any cure of importance, without the counsell and assistance of one or more learned and skilfull Physitians. But in defence of <hi>Empericks</hi> and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant practitioners, there is a seeming strong objection made by the vulgar, alwaies ready to deceive themselves, and applaud their owne ignorance; to wit, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten good hap, and a prosperous and successefull event doth second and accompany the actions and attempts of the Empericke and ignorant Physitian; and therefore (say they) why may wee not make use of such persons? As I doe not deny that which cannot be concealed from a very ordinary understanding; so doe I againe deny that this argument taken from issue or event, was ever taken in paiment for currant coine, by the judicious and more refined understanding. And although I have already <note n="g" place="margin">Anatomy of urines <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> elsewhere made appeare the invalidity of this threed-bare argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet shall it not be impertinent to speake a word or two in this place:</p>
   <p>The Wise <note n="h" place="margin">Ecclesiast 9.2.</note>
      <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>The like event befalleth the good and the bad; all things come alike</hi> (saith he) <hi>to all there is one event: to the wicked and to the good, and to the cleane, and to the uncleane; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner, and hee that sweareth, as hee that feareth an oath.</hi> Even
<pb n="5" facs="10"/>
so doe we not deny, that the learned and judicious Physitian and the ignorant <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericke</hi> have often alike successe; for under the learned Physitian, the patient often recovereth his former health; and the like befalleth the <hi>Empericke</hi> also. And againe, as the patient dieth sometimes under the <hi>Empericke,</hi> so doeth this as truely and really befall the skilfull and learned Physitian.<note place="margin">Issue and event is no good argument t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> prove a sufficiency in the professiō of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.</note> And therefore conclude the ignorant and vulgar sort, what difference is there then betwixt the one and the other; at least in regard of their practice? I answer, that all diseases are either curable or incurable. If the disease be curable, and a skilfull, able and honest Physitian be called; by the good meanes hee useth the blessing of the Almighty accompanying his indevours, hee for the most part recovereth his patient. I say, for the most part, for that sometimes some unexpected accident, as likewise the morosity of the patient, neglect of the assistants in performing their parts, may often occur,<note place="margin">Difference betwixt the Empirick and the learned Artist.</note> and so hinder the good successe of the Physitians paines and best indevours, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the disease were not of it selfe incurable. And sometimes againe, some disease, howsoever in it selfe curable, yet may sometimes be accompanied with such terrible and dangerous accidents and signes, as doe usually accompany such as are shortly to be arrested by sergeant death; and yet after the Physitians prognosticke, the patient may vnexpectedly recouer, as sometimes hath beene seene. Now, if our <hi>Empericke,</hi> or ignorant Physitian bee called to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the two, the patients strength persisting, and no rub nor let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his way, the coast being cleare, his remedies, perhaps, not so pertinent, and appropriat for the patient, yet may this sicke party recover under his hand, yea, and if he should be yet called to the latter of the two, by the skilfull Physitian now given over to a desperate Prognosticke, and shall boldly undertake the cure of such a person, promising faire and boldly (as is the common custome of such people) although he administer nothing to the purpose, yea rather, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that which is quite contrary to the right cure (as commeth most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to passe,<note place="margin">An Empiricke or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Physitian may sometimes casually and by chance hit upon som cure where a more sufficient and learned Physitian may before have past his prognosticke to be past his recovery.</note> howsoever seldome by watchfull eyes observed) and this Patient now unexpectedly (strength and vigor of body, perhaps blowing away all the former feares of evill accidents) contrary to the learned Physitians prognostick recover; will not the vulgar here admire, magnifie and extoll the casuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this new <hi>Doctor duns,</hi> setting him no lower than on the top of the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of fames Temple. The other againe, how skilfull soever in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and able artist, yet shall be traduced by virulent and malignant tongues, and often esteemed a Physitian of no account. And yet for all this, neither was the former the honester man, but still an ignorant asse and a duns. <hi>Sifueris pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, remanebis asinus idem.</hi> Neither yet is the other the more ignorant or unsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor will bee otherwise accounted of among the learned and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing sort. Sometimes againe, it may so come to passe that such an ignorant <hi>Empiricke</hi> may at the first be called to such a patient as we last mentioned, and out of an impudent temeritie (howsoever the danger, to a judicious eye may not seeme small) without any ground of Art or rule in reason, at randome bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise the patient speedy recovery, and for this purpose, still after his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricall manner, administer such medicines as his shallow and ignorant capacitie is able to reach unto, and perhaps, at length attaine to the height of his hopes: yet shal I still avouch that this is but a casuall cure, not proceeding from any skillfull sufficiency, or right judgement, and therefore not to be trusted to. And if but an ordinary artist should with a watchfull eye diligently and narrowly observe the ordinary proceeding of such an <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> he should observe him often, where dangers are not so easily espied, and to none but a judicious understanding obvious, to sooth up his deluded patient with the saying of old <hi>Agag,</hi>

Besides, it is yet a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable into what great danger people doe precipitate themselues, who fall into such ignorant Physitians hands, who worke thus by hap hazard, and play, as it were, at fast and loose with mens lives. Againe sometimes, yea and that very often the learned and judicious Physitian is sent for to the patient now irrecoverably sicke of some desperate disease, whereof hee shortly after dieth.

      </note> I know the common thredbare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that they have many times attained to the knowledge of some <hi>Probatum est,</hi> or medicine experimentally tried upon some one or other individuall body, and that most cōmonly casually, or <hi>hab nab</hi> as we say, as the blind man throwe▪ his

staffe, and even in this where they thinke have experience, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deceived, and neither they nor our ordinary Empiricks can tell what is the true nature thereof. Now the true nature of any experiment to make it such a one, is not sufficiently proved by this, that after once or twice triall thereof there hath insued some seeming good effect: for this is but a meere Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, ascribing often that effect to such a cause, which was not the true cause thereof; they often erring, because they are oftentimes deceived in things even subject to their outward senses; the cause of their erring proceeding from this, that in severall sicke persons there are divers and various conditions, natures, affections, &amp;c: and each of these may alter and vary the manner of curing: and therefore since neither women nor yet any other sort of Empiricks doe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily observe, neither are they therefore ever able to derive their remedies from true experience. Now the causes of these varieties are, the particular constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the partie Diseased, the age, time of the yeare, the countrey wherein one liveth, the present temper of the time, strength of the sicke, custome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exercise, the disease it selfe, the cause, the part affected, the symptomes, like diseases, the manner, motion, repletion, the structure of the parts, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pulse, the manners or condition of the sicke, things helping or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, without the distinct knowledge of which conditions we can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any true experiment, concerning which we shall hereafter have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to discourse more copiuosly. And a medicine may at one particular time fit some one, and not another, although ceized with the same disease, and so in all these particular circumstances might be easily proved, all occasioned by reason of the variety of such considerable circumstances. And therefore the very same medicine which once might have produced a good and laudable effect, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at an other time, even in one and the same individuall body, at some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time faile of this effect, the state of the body upon divers occasions, altering, and divers circumstances often inducing the skilfull Physitian to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to some other more appropriate remedy, or else to adde or detract from his former prescription, according as in his discretion he seeth indicated by these aforementioned circumstances in such a case required. And from hence is also detected and evinced the error of some; who having at sometimes used the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of some understanding Physitian for some preventing Physicke, this same Physitian afterwards either absent or perhaps dead, and it may be neither, yet often either by ignorance, a sordid tenacity, or both, procure the same medicines againe by the Apothecary to be prepared according to the former prescription, without either addition or detraction of the former ingredients, little conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the alteration of the body, which might according to new occurrents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand new counsell. But to returne to our Women againe, some of this sex thinking to mend the matter well, answere thus for themselves, that if they do no good, yet at least they doe no harme. I answere, that even in not doing good, or administring that which in probability with Gods blessing was like to have done good, they doe evill: for in that they are unfurnished of that sufficiency of administring such fit and generous remedies as are likely to eradicate and root out the disease, they commonly trifle away the time, and lose that golden time and opportunity in doing good in dangerous and acute diseases, which once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost can never againe be recalled and recovered.</p>

      <hi>but even also by some of better breeding (I can but pitty their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ignorance) who would not faile to prescribe directions against any most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate and inveterate disease: and yet was altogether averse from Phlebotomy, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, or any generous remedy, were the disease never so violent and acute; her chiefe purge being a little</hi> Manna, <hi>a certain diet-bread composed of severall cordiall ingredients, without any due proportion of quantity: and this diet-bread she used indifferently in all consumptions and weakenesses of whatsoever kind. A vesicatory or blistering medicine composed of Cantharides she used much, and applyed the same to divers parts of the body, according as her she-skill could direct her, which was one of her master medicines, and with her supplyed the place of Phlebotomy and other generous evacuations.</hi> The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and evill favoured effects this Pettie-coat Physitian produced in divers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by these blisterings would spend me much time,<note place="margin">Particular remedies must follow after ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</note> and be too tedious to the Reader. Howsoever the learned Physitian is not ignorant that such particular remedies are not ordinarily used before generall evacuations have proceeded. Many, no question, consulted with this she-oracle, whose diseases were not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or deadly, who afterwards recovering (which might as well, if not better have beene without the use of her meanes) would not faile to magnifie her supposed skill.<note place="margin">

And this being a taske which often poseth the most skilfull Artist in his profession, what then should we expect from such a she-Physitian? And since she neglected more noble and generous remedies, when there was anything to bee done in dangerous and acute diseases, if nature were not of it selfe able to grapple with the disease, and expell the enemie out of his strong hold, the patient was forced to succumbe under the burden, and in all probability pay his fatall debt before he otherwise needed, if he had made choice of a judicious and understanding physitian. But what do I insist upon their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Physick, a thing of a sublime nature, when even in the matter of the diet of the diseased, yet thought by them a thing of very smal importance, they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant?

against woman-kind, as some make it their recreation and delight too, to shew their wits (as they suppose) in inveighing against women: nay farre be it from me, being in a double relation beholden to this sexe; my purpose onely is here to reprove their errors, whereof all are not guilty, and for this cause come not under this censure, and to such I have nothing to say. And even touching this instability and inclination to extremes, I am so farre from laying thereby any aspersion upon this noble sexe, that with mine Author I account it for their high praise and commendation. <hi>For these extreme affections proceed from a subtill, nimble and able wit and understanding, set and fastened in a soft, tender and well refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned body. And as we esteeme that water to be good which is speedily warme, and againe in as short a time cold; even so wee may account the complexion of such persons as are subiect to sudden changes and alterations, and suddenly passe from one extreme to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is most simple and pure; for the contray proceedeth from a lumpish ponderosity and thicknesse of the matter, which procureth this contumacious immobility. Women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it seemeth, are composed of this pure, refined, soft substance, which is the cause that they are often so quicke and apprehensive, that therein, as also in their superlative affection, they commonly surpasse men.</hi> And hence have we this common Phrase, that <hi>if a woman looke but on her apron-strings, she will finde out a shift.</hi> And for this same cause it is held, that a womans first answere is commonly the best, and that if she study longer, it will still be the worse. But lest I should make wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men too proud, I wish them to consider that the most subtill and refined wits are not alwayes most usefull in a state or common-wealth, as is reported of <note n="r" place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>in eius vna</hi> History of womens contradiction and controlling the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians prescriptions far out of purpose.</note>
      <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> of this unstable and quicke-stirring spirit: and the like opinion is holden of the <hi>Florentines</hi> at this day; and it is no more triviall true, <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nimium vertitur in vitium.</hi> And therefore my counsell is to women, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as partake most of this subtill, mercuriat metall, to keepe within the cancells and compasse of right reason: and I wish them not to thinke so well of their owne wits, as to meddle with matters farre above their reach, and too sublime for their apprehensions, and to keepe within the compasse of their owne callings, not to prove busy-bodies, smatterers, going from house to house, and controlling the learned Artist in his owne profession, nor his prescriptions for the sicke, the reason whereof they are not at all able to comprehend. <hi>The yeere</hi> 1629. <hi>a young woman of this Towne of Northampton, under thirtie, a married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and then giving sucke, participating most of a sanguine complexion, had for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dayes been much molested with a great distemper of heat, accompanied with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great paines in her backe and other parts, together with some other accidents. My counsell being craved, I told both her husband and her selfe, I doubted Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would prove her best and speediest remedy, on the which, notwithstanding at that time, for certaine reasons I would not adventure, onely for the present with prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of appropriate diet appointed with all some such things as might then safely by her be admitted. But her accidents still rather increasing than decreasing, and sleepe now forsaking her, I reiterated my former advice concerning Phlebotomy, which neglected might endanger her life. This being heard by some of her neighbours and friends, with great earnestnesse disswaded her from this course. But the young woman her selfe, her husband, father and mother, were willing to follow my directions: which being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly put in execution, she was immediately freed from all her former accidents, as, blessed be God, she hath beene ever since that time.</hi> And whereas it was by some of her neighbours and friends feared, that this might prove a meanes to dry up her milke, it proved farre otherwise, being afterwards better furnished there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with than before: and good reason; her great distempering heat, together with the want of rest, and appetite to her ordinary sustenance, must needes dry the spring of this so laudable and necessary a nourishment; whereas this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Phlebotomy, by removing these rubs, did, accidentally, increase the same. I instance in this one particular and recent example among many, to make it appeare what wrong and injury is often offered both to the Patient and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian by this pragmaticall controlling of some of this sexe; who being now warned, I hope, will grow wiser, and let the Physitian use his discretion in

ordering and curing his patients; as hee medleth not with the businesses of their callings, leaving them to their owne liberty. My purpose is not here to speake against the charity of some noble personages of this sex, ready both with their paines and purses, to supply the wants of the poore and needy, unfurnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both of such meanes and money; provided alwaies, they doe not exceed the limits in venturing upon things farre surpassing their reach: and although they are endowed with some priviledges and prerogatives above vulgar worth: yet I wish them still to consider their sex, and that they are farre from that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in this physicall profession, as to be admitted to sit upon life and death. And now by the way, before I finish this point, concerning Women-physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I cannot passe by the great charity, and bountifull libreality of a Noble and vertuous Lady, living lately in this towne of <hi>Northampton</hi>
      <note n="s" place="margin">My Lady <hi>Farmer,</hi> widow to that noble Knight, S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>George Farmer</hi> of Cason by Toceter in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton-shire.</note> a constant good house-keeper, and great reliever of the necessities of the poore: and so charitable to all true objects of pitty, that not onely would she send them food to feed them; but supply them also with her best cordialls, or other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall drugges in her possession (wherewith shee had alwaies her closet well furnished) as should be advised by wise and learned counsell: and yet, herselfe never venturing on such things as might endanger any. And to poore women in labor she neither spared her paines nor her purse; and would not disdaine in that necessity freely and of her owne accord to visit the meanest and poorest cottages. As for her charity to poore widowes, orphanes and others, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory thereof is so recent, and now in this penurious time so much missed, that I need not now to dwell upon it. And therefore well might it be said of her; <note n="t" place="margin">Iob 29.13. V. 31.16, 17, &amp;c.</note>

      <note place="margin">Another sort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Physicke as dāgerous, if not more than the former.</note>Now besides all these former offenders, there is yet another sort of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners as pernicious and dangerous, if not more than the former. All these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offenders, howsoever they bee dangerous and pernicious pests in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; yet are they often easily espyed, and taken notice of, especially by a meane and ordinary judicious understanding, howsoever the simpler sort be often taken in their snares: but these other of whom we are now to speake, doe often deceive some more refined understandings. And this commeth to passe by reason of a certaine vizard or shew of some learning; and yet not able by maturity and ability of understandings to performe by practicall operation, that whereof in shew they make profession. And therefore such novices as have perhaps attained to some few scraps of <hi>Latine</hi> in the Grammer-schoole; and perhaps proceeded yet further, to reside some space at the Vniversity; and afterwards by reading some Physicke bookes, take themselves to bee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furnished for the performance of so great a taske, without either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or manuduction of able masters skilled in that profession, come here to bee reproved. And howsoever an otherwise able and industrious scholler may have attained to the highest degree the Vniversity could afford him, in an other faculty, yet from hence to evince a sufficiency in the faculty of Physicke were such a <hi>non sequitur,</hi> as might justly be hissed out of the schooles. But my purpose is chiefely to speake in this place of a sort of people,<note place="margin">The difficulty of the practice of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession might iustly deterre such as are engaged in another great calling from the practice thereof.</note> who by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves into two professions defraud both of their due attendance. My meaning is of such Ministers, who beside that waightie calling to the cure of soules wherewith they are betrusted, not without the neglect thereof, doe wrongfully and injuriously, both contrary to the Law of God and man, intrude upon another weighty profession, This their lawlesse and unlimited expatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>
and pragmaticall intrusion, doth justly challenge a vindication from so great a wrong and injury offered to this Art, and the professors of the same. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this injury hath heretofore, both out of the pulpit, and by the pen of the learned been spoken against; and my selfe also gave a touch thereof in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my former Tractat; yet hath all this as yet produced no reformation. And therefore courteous Reader, with thy good leave and patience, let mee a little expatiat into this field, to shew the offenders, the heinousnesse of their fault; and let no man mervaile if I be a little large on this point, this kind of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners now so abounding in every corner of this kingdome. And that I wrong them not to enter the lists with advantagious weapons, I shall make choice of such as they cannot justly except against: and therefore all my proofes shall bee taken out of the oracles and aphorismes of the old and new Testament; out of the antient councells and constitutions of the canon-law; adding thereunto a word or two out of the municipall lawes and constitutions of this kingdome. It would seeme that the difficulty of the practising of this profession of Physicke, the multiplicity of knowledge thereunto required, together with the assidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diligence in the practice thereof, required the Physitians presence with his patient, his necessary attendance being often even then required for the cure of the body, when master Parson should bee curing and converting soules in the Church assembly. And it would seeme that an honest, conscionable Divine, in regard of the waight of his owne calling, might finde worke enough without any such expatiation and intrusion upon another calling, requiring so much paines,<note place="margin">The Physitians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence (if it can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be obtained) with his patient were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</note> diligence and assiduity in the practice thereof. Besides, that this is no small encouragement for ignorant and idle droanes to tread in the same pathes. Now that amongst the antient people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> these two professions were not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by one, but had severall and distinct professors, I thinke no man of a meane understanding will deny, and therefore may save a labor in proving it. And that <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 40.13, &amp;c. Levit. 8.1, 2, &amp;c.</note>
      <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were commanded to wait and attend upon the service of the Tabernacle first, and afterwards of the Temple, I read in the old Testament; but concerning the practice of Physicke not one word. The <hi>Prophets</hi> are all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proclaime their Masters message to that stubborne and stiffe-necked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which was the whole subject of their Sermon. And as concerning their extraordinary and miraculous gift of healing; as likewise of our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> practise, I thinke no man will mainteine that Practice to be any proofe to mainteine this lawlesse intrusion. In the new Testament the holy <hi>Apostles</hi> were commanded to preach the Gospell to all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. And they are also commanded, I confesse, to heale their infirmities: the first of which was by unavoidable dependancy for ever annexed to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall function, the latter being temporary, and tyed onely to those times of the infancy of the Church: howsoever our <hi>Romanists</hi> would still seeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine an apish imitation of Apostolicall antiquity in their anointing oyle, the absurdity whereof, together with their different practice, quite contrary to their pretext, from a very meane and ordinary understanding can hardly bee concealed, and therefore, as not perteining to our purpose, and being likewise largely, by our learned Divines confuted, I here leave. The holy <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> giveth a strict charge to his scholler <hi>Timothy</hi> to waite on his ministeriall function, after he had set downe as well the duty required of such as enter into that profession, as the excellency and eminency of the calling it selfe. <note n="*" place="margin">Tim. 4.13, 14, 15, 16.</note>
      <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to Doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. Meditate upon these things, give thy selfe wholly to them, that thy profiting may appeare unto all. Take heed unto thy selfe, and unto the doctrine, continue in them: for in so doing thou shalt both save thy selfe and them that heare thee.</hi> Againe the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> and in the same Epistle. <note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.21.</note>
      <hi>I charge thee before GOD, and the Lord Iesus Christ, and the elect Angells, that thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things.</hi> And againe in another place. <hi>No man that warreth intangleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the affaires of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to bee a souldier.</hi> Now then it plainely appeareth, that <hi>Timothy</hi> must not bee intangled
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
with the affaires of this life; but wholly attend upon his ministery. And what was <hi>Timothy?</hi> That he was a Bishop cannot be denied: and some would have him a Bishop with authority over others; as may be seene in a <note n="*" place="margin">D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Downame</hi> B. of Derry in a Sermon preached at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the B. of Bath and Wells.</note> late Writer; where this is none of his meanest arguments for the defence of the Hierarchie; which controversie, I have not here any purpose to meddle with. But let the case stand as it will, of this I am sure, the best Divines doe not doubt, but that these aforenamed places doe concerne every Minister of the Word. And if it were proved he were a Prelate, (as some would have him) the argument is then the stronger on our side: for if Bishops themselves bee thus tied to such attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, how shall other ministers, whether Parsons or Vicars, bee freed from this commandement? But heare yet againe the same <hi>Apostle</hi> confirme his former charge. <note n="a" place="margin">2 Timoth. 3.1.2.</note>
      <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing and his kingdome, preach the Word; bee instant in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.</hi> The words are plaine enough, and need no comment to cleere the meaning of this place. <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 12.14.</note> Our blessed Lord and Saviour, although intreated, yet would not meddle with dividing of inheritances; so far was he from countenancing this incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon other mens callings. And in his last Will and Testament, before his Ascension, what was it he gave so strictly in charge to <hi>Peter,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the rest of the <hi>Apostles?</hi> was it not even this, <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 21.15, &amp;c.</note>

And although those places already alleaged might suffice, yet shall it not bee impertinent, to adde yet another place out of the same <hi>Apostle;</hi> where giving a charge to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and by consequence directions with a charge to all other Christians to the end of the world concerning callings, hath these words. <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.20, 24.</note>
      <hi>Let euery man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</hi> And a little after, the better to imprint it in their memories, repeateth the same the second time. And the phrase is to be observed that it is of a calling in the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, not callings in the plurall. A man must therefore carefully keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compasse of his calling, and not rashly rush upon another mans profession. And besides, as there ought not to bee a remissenesse in any calling, be it neuer so meane, so ought there especially to bee a redoubled diligence in this weightiest of all other callings. <note n="e" place="margin">Proverb. 22 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </note>
      <hi>Men may not enter upon two distinct callings at once, and that in three cases: First, if God have disjoyned these two callings by his Word and Commandement. Secondly, if the practice of the one hinder the practice of the other. Thirdly, if the combining of them together hinder the common good. On these grounds our Savior Christ being the Doctor of the Church, refused to be a</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 12.14.</note>
      <hi>iudge of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance betwixt the two brethren. And hereupon the Apostles being to performe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their owne callings, refused to performe the</hi>
      <note n="l" place="margin">Acts 6.2.</note>
      <hi>office of Deacons.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</hi> Now that preaching of the Word with the dependances of the same, and the practicing of Physicke are in the Word of God distinct and severall callings, may easily, by that which hath beene said already, appeare. And in the second place, that the practice of the one hindreth the performance of the other as it ought; those that well weigh the weight of both callings, their severall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, large extents paines and labor to be imploied about either of them, must needs confesse, that whosoever will conscionably performe his ministeriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as he ought and is fitting, shall therein find imployment enough without medling with other matters: neither ought that man to be trusted with the cure
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>
of the body, who maketh so small account thereof, that he maketh it not worth the busying of himselfe wholly about it. Now in the third place, that the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of both professions by one man is prejudiciall to the common good, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from hence appeare; in that it confoundeth two so waighty distinct callings, ingrossing both into one mans hand, whereby he is hindred to performe the duties of either as he ought: each of them, sometimes, demanding his personall presence at one and the sametime, which without hurt to the publike and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to many private persons, cannot be omitted. And againe, in depriving him who is set apart for the profession of Physicke, and whose proper calling it is, of his due reward, doe they not, as much as in them lieth, deprive the publike of so great a good? And therefore this in famous bigamy cannot choose but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious both to the soule and body. The eminency of their place and calling, as being set, not <note n="m" place="margin">Math. 3.15.</note> under a bushell, but on a candlesticke to give light to the whole house, doth not a little aggrauate their offence, as likewise that the injury is not done to a few, but to a many. <note n="n" place="margin">Isay 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>But let us now see whether the canon-law will not allow and countenance such lawlesse intrusion upon other professions.

   <p>But that this practice hath some pretext for it, at least in seeming shew, and that it hath some appearance to have been practised by the Priests under the Leviticall law, some Clergie-men (although to small purpose) have pleaded as a part of their apologie; and therefore I will remove this vizard.

      <hi>To the outward ceremonie whereof</hi> (saith Calvin) <hi>howbeit wee be not tied, yet are we Christians, taught by the same not to suffer any corruptions to dwell amongst us whereby Gods pure worship and service may be defiled.</hi> It may then plainly appeare, that the intention of <hi>Moses</hi> was not here to give the Priests any authority or allowance to meddle with physicke; the which may yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the words of the same <note n="*" place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> Author following: <hi>In that God appointed Priests, and that of the highest ranke, it is an argument that here Gods spirituall worship is more aimed at, than the health of the body.</hi> And this hee setteth downe yet more plainely in these words following: <hi>The Lord betrusted not here every Levite, but the Sonnes of</hi> Aaron <hi>only, who were of prime note and credit; to this end, that the authority of the action might be the greater. Therefore the Popish Priests</hi> (saith he) <hi>not without great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or rather impudency, have drawne this jurisdiction unto themselves. That which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth is yet a more grosse mockage. The officiall, being the Bishops deputie, as lawfull judge, calleth before him Physitians and Surgeons, by whose answers being instructed, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth sentence of whereof that he acknowledgeth himselfe altogether ignorant.</hi> But to come to our purpose againe, if wee should grant that here were some physicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections addressed unto Priests; yet would not this warrant every Parson and Vicar to practise physicke at his pleasure: for here the command is addressed to the chiefe Priests, the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> onely, and not to the rest: whence all they would evince (if the precept were perpetuall, and they could prove their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion linially descended from <hi>Aaron,</hi> better than those mentioned in <hi>Ezra</hi> for want of this put from the Priesthood) would perhaps be this, that the Bishop of the Diocesse might practise physicke. Besides, the text saith, the Priest was onely to pronounce, whether it were that loathsome disease of Leprosie or no; the marks and signes whereof the Lord himselfe there setteth downe: but that the Priest cured it, or was yet warranted so to doe, or inabled with any skill to effect such a cure, remaineth yet to prove. Again, if this place gave any warrant or leave to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, yet were it onely in this lothsome disease of Leprosie; from the which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinde, our God of his singular goodnesse hath freed these our cold climats. Againe, when mention is made of once or twice seven daies for the triall of the cleannesse of the partie, it cannot be denied, that here was an immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing this whole action, not to be by any man drawne into imitation, no more than was that of the <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 5.11, 12.</note> Adultresse woman. The mentioning of seven daies reiterated, doth still make the case more manifest. Now, in the ordinary and common motion of diseases, wee finde so great variety and difference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the severall causes and constitutions of bodies, together with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances; that very few doe wee find among many, howsoever surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the same sicknesse, agree in all points. And hence also commeth it to passe, that wee cannot alwaies precizely determine of the good or bad issue of the disease, neither in one, two, or three weekes, as the undoubted oracle of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty determined of this disease, including it within the precincts of this sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenarie once or twice reiterated. The severall <note n="b" place="margin">Acutorum morborum non omnino sunt certa praedictiones vitae aut mertis. <hi>Aph. 19. lib. 2.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>crises</hi> of acute diseases, occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times a doubtfull prediction, doe plainly prove the truth of this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if they will yet stand stiffely upon the point, pleading their privilege, we will rather yeeld to them the cure of the Lepers than contend: provided they will rest therewith contented: howbeit they shall never be able from this place to prove, that the Priests did cure this disease: and yet farre lesse, that any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here conferred upon them to cure either this or any other disease. But when the old will not serve, some of them flie to the new Testament, thinking there to finde some shelter, and to confirme this their opinion. S. <hi>Luke,</hi> say they, was both an Evangelist and a Physitian. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ministers may be both Physitians for the soule and the body. In the first place, the antecedent is not yet proved for an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truth: and although there were yet no controversie concerning the same, yet
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>
the consequence might be denied.<note place="margin">Whether S. <hi>Luk.</hi> were both an Evangelist and a Physitian.</note> In the first place then, it is by some questioned, whether <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist were a Physitian or no? Some, I confesse, are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they were all one, and others againe deny it. Some of our antient writers doe affirme it; and hence commeth it to passe, that as in Popery, other profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions had purchased to themselves severall Saints; so did the Physitians like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise lay hold on S. <hi>Luke,</hi> whose day is by them in the Popish church very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely observed holy. <note n="c" place="margin">In his cōmentaries upon this place.</note>

And againe, the same <note n="e" place="margin">2 Timoth. 4.11.</note> Apostle mentioning him in another place, onely mentioneth him without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Evangelist. That which some alleage out of <note n="f" place="margin">Philem. 24</note> another place, that hee was <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-helper, is not of sufficient waight to prove it: for many were <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-helpers that were no Evangelists; as <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 16.3.</note>
      <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> tent-makers, were his fellow-helpers. But for avoiding tediousnesse I will omit the enumeration of more authorities, these being sufficient to prove the point to be controverted. Againe, suppose that were yet true, what if I should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that as in former times hee had beene a Physitian, but afterwad for a more waighty employment had forsaken it, (which is very probable) what place of Scripture could they produce to the contrary? Howsoever, sure I am, he was never such an intruding urine-monging, busy-body, as these of whom wee heere speake.</p>
   <p>But lest I shall be thought to dwell too long upon this point, I wish both them and all other offenders in this kind to take warning by that which hath been said already. And let no man mervaile that I have somwhat at large handled this point, the offenders having so long now steeled their foreheads against all admonitions; this festered disease breaking still forth afresh in many parts of this kingdome. I would likewise wish those who shall have occasion to use a Physitian at any time, well to weigh the premisses, carefully considering with whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust their bodies in their greatest need. But in any case I wish none had a hand in the distracting a Clergy-man from his calling, which may appeare by some thing lately said,<note place="margin">Learned and able Physitians are not so frequent nor in that number as ignorant, and why?</note> how much the antient fathers of the Church did distaste. It is true indeed that learned and able Physitians are not so frequent, nor in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as ignorant Empiricks and such other as we haue lately mentioned: And that both by reason learning hath not its due reward; and above any other profession the vulgar sort being least able to judge of the depth of this of Physick (howsoever with <hi>Salomons</hi> foole they thinke their skill here transcendnet) preferring for the most part any ignorant Mountebanke, Quacke-salving Empiricke, a medling Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, a woman-physitian, before the most skilfull and experienced Physitian in his profession. And these idle droanes, who never were initiated into these medicinall mysteries, spending the honey whereon the industrious and diligent Bee should feed, make them lesse to abound. And yet those who will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto them, especially in any City or great towne of note, may finde some to whom in time of need they may have recourse. But as it is the common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the world, that of things of most sublime condition they make often choice of the worst; so it proveth too true, as in former times, so in this last age of the world, that <hi>Mund us vult decipi: It seemeth that the world desireth to bee deceived,</hi> and loveth darknesse rather than light. Now notwithstanding the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime nature and bottomlesse depth of this noble profession, there is none of the other two, Divinity and Law I meane, where there is that lawlesse liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion left so free as in this: and yet I dare bee bold to say and avouch, that the paines of neither of these two callings (I speake it not to vilipend or any waies extenuat the paines of either of those two noble professions) can be parallelled or equalled with the paines of the diligent and painefull Physitian;<note place="margin">The Physitians paines far exceed the paines of other professions.</note> and yet either of them exceed the Physitian in the recompence for his paines. And this will yet more plainely appeare, if we shall parallell and compare these three professions
<pb n="19" facs="17"/>
together. I will beginne then with their paines taken before they attaine to any reward of learning. The able and learned Divine (I meane not a duns, a droane, or Empiricke divine, as I may so call him) hath first been trained up in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon schooles of good learning both grammaticall and Philosophicall, and hath, according to standing and seniority, taken such degrees in the Vniversity, as have been by our forefathers thought fit, to grace and adorne learning, and encourage schollers to the pursuite of some eminent excellency in the same. And after this, they attaine to some place of the Church, some of greater, and some of lesser va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. And some againe rise to higher preferment, according to worth, meanes, friends and favour. The worthy, honest, carefull and conscionable Divines (for of such I speake) are laborious and painefull in their callings, preaching in season and out of season; administering the Sacraments, and visiting the sicke, &amp;c. And with those most laborious I parallell the Physitians paines, and not with many other idle ones, there being no need of any comparison with such persons.<note place="margin">The Divines prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</note> Now this is a prerogative common to all Divines, that although many of them come farre short of that allowance which the eminency of their callings, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their parts, and great paines doe deserve, yet are they sure of their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance during life, and during that time and terme he knoweth there is no body can come betwixt him and home. And this to be reasonable and equitable no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, I thinke, will deny. The Lawyer is likewise trained up in the schooles of good learning, both grammaticall, and sometimes Philosophicall (at least most part of them have spent some time at the Vniversity) and what time is wanting there, it is againe supplied by continuance and studying in some Innes of Court: and after a convenient time they are admitted to the barre to practise their profession, and are according to custome, paied for their counsell. Many also in processe of time, as the Divines in the Church, so are they likewise, some I meane, preferred to high and eminent places of the common-wealth, both of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature and others. As for the matter of the studies whereabout both are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant, the one is employed in the large study of Divinity, which concerneth the soule: The other in the cases of the common-law of this land, which I confesse is a painfull and laborious study, and many cases with variety of circumstances therin to be considered, and those who are emploied are requited for their paines, as both equity and reason doe require that a man should live by his labours.<note place="margin">Physitians study of a far larger extent then either of the Divine or the Lawyer.</note> Now as concerning the Physitian, he is not behind either of the other two in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary time of his study, and that both in the ordinary grammar-schooles, and the Vniversity. And as concerning the nature and quality of the particular study of this profession, it is as hard and intricate (if not more) as any of the former two: and besides, it is of a farre larger extent. For in the first place, schollers well know the Theory of Physicke to be a great and large field of knowledge, our Authors many and various, and of severall sorts, the Authors of severall nations, and written in severall ages and at severall times: <hi>Greeke, Latine, Arabian,</hi> and divers others, both antient and moderne, of all which, the learned Physitian (for of such, and not of ignorant and unlearned Empirickes I here speake) maketh use. And the Physitian doth yet herein goe beyond the other two, in that hee is,<note place="margin">Large extent of the Physitians study.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his ordinary Theory, to bee acquainted with the whole structure and frame of the body of man, as being the subject whereabout he is conversant. Besides, he searcheth into the secret and abstrusest closet and cabinet of nature, inquiring into the natures and qualities both of simples and compounds in the universall world: all things sublunary comming within the compasse of his profession: yea, the Heavens themselves come within the precincts of his knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in that superstitious manner as some doe, and would tye us thereunto. But he considereth exactly the aire, with the alterations thereof, and neglecteth not the other Elements, with all the creatures conteined therein, either for the use of food or Physicke. Now come to the Physitians practicall imployment, and what profession can compare with the Physitians paines? The severall and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous constitutions of mens bodies, so diametrally differing one from another,<note place="margin">Physitians practicall paines do far exceed other professions.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the various accidents, like sudden stormes arising in the aire, make
<pb n="20" facs="18"/>
the Physitians paines often extraordinary. What shall I say of the <hi>Idiosyncrasicall</hi> (as I may so call it) or individuall severall propriety of divers patients, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often as farre, as one face from another in feature? And what a world of worke doth this breed to an honest and industrious Physitian; while as he is not only forced to prescribe fit and apt remedies against the disease, of what sort soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (which were worke enough) but must with all accommodate himselfe to give content to so many severall palats, perhaps, as he hath patients, as the <note n="h" place="margin">Poscentes vario mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum diversa palato, <hi>Horat.</hi>
      </note> Poet said of his guests? Some cannot endure to take pills, some abhorre potions, some must have powders, some electuaries, and upon some wee can scarce fasten any Physicke at all,<note place="margin">Physitians have much adoe to please their patients palats.</note> when often it standeth them on no lesse danger than their life. Some againe can abide no sweet thing: and to some againe nothing but sugar and sweet things will downe their silken throats, &amp;c: so that many times by reason of this nicety, we cannot exhibit such fit and generous remedies as are fit to oppugne the malignity and contumacy of their disease. And thus they verifie the Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall saying: <hi>The cat would faine fish eate, but is loath her feet to wet.</hi> And many lazy Christians would faine goe to Heaven, if they might bee carried thither in their feather-bed, or walke the broade way of their lusts and sinfull pleasures. And yet, if things succeed not to their owne or friends expectation, how carefull and diligent soever the Physitian prove in his endeavour, the Physitian oftentimes must beare the blame. Besides all this, the patients peevishnesse, frowardnesse and testy discontents,<note place="margin">And many troubles they must undergoe.</note> and often without a cause finding fault where none is, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth still a new trouble to the Physitian: that I say nothing of his extraordinary trouble many times, and paines required at unseasonable seasons. Besides, his best endeavours are often crossed, or at least suspended by womens, and other igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons unseasonable whisperings, and idle suggestions, often to the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable damage and hurt of the sicke patient, and great griefe of the Physitian.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Physitians best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons often mis-costru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully traduced.</note>And many times, when hee hath done his utmost indevour to prolong the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents life, like a brave Captaine, that never surrendereth his fort so long as there is any provision of munition and other necessaries left within; yet at length, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall period of his life being come, and the oile of the lampe failing, the Physitian is many times, especially by the vulgar and most ignorant, traduced or blamed; either for some neglect, or else all his actions construed in the worst sense; and how generous a remedy soever, whether phlebotomy or purgation, &amp;c. how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly soever applied, yet is often accounted the cause or occasion of the patients death. And many times, if the patient recover, although under God, the Physitians industrious paines hath proved the meanes of the patients recovery, yet is he often partaker of the smallest share of the praise and commendation.</p>
   <p>And it fareth often with the Physitian, as it did sometimes with that famous <note n="i" place="margin">
         <hi>Plutarch</hi> in ejus vita.</note>
      <hi>Captaine Lucullus,</hi> who, after hee had subdued the Asiaticke countries, then came <hi>Pompey</hi> and reaped the harvest of his honour: so many times, when the art of the diligent and industrious Physitian hath expugned the strength, and shaken the foundation of the disease, then commeth some ignorant Empericke, a woman-phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,<note place="margin">Ignorant and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving people often rob the Physitian of his deserved praise and commendation.</note> or the like, who with a trifle exhibited after the use of many other laudable medicines, will carry away the due and deserved praise and commendation belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Physitian, and of this I can beare witnesse, as of many instances in mine owne particular experience; so I will instance but in this one: <hi>Within these few yeeres, I had in cure a Gentlewoman, betwixt</hi> 30 <hi>and</hi> 40 <hi>yeeres of age, and a married woman, dwelling within a few miles of this towne of</hi> Northampton, <hi>who was much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the splene, the stone in the kidnies, accomponied with extraordinarie hystericall fits, commonly knowne by the name of Mother, that few thought she could recover. After I had done my best indevour in using meanes fit for her recovery, and through the blessing of God upon my labours,</hi>
      <note place="margin">History.</note>
      <hi>she freed from all her former fits and evill accidents which did so much molest and vexe her; a Gentlewoman, a neighbour of hers, her good friend, and no ill wisher of mine, advised her to drinke in a morning a cup of good ale, with some nutmegg, suger and a tost, a good gossip cup I confesse; and this same cup in this gentlewomans apprehension, carried away all the praise and commendation of this cure, although both her husband and her selfe had often acknowledged me under God the Author of her health.</hi> Now, the Divine is not
<pb n="21" facs="18"/>
liable to any of the premisses, and howbeit, his paines I confesse to be great,<note place="margin">Divines freed from many incombrances whereunto the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian is subiect.</note> yet for the most part, he knoweth his times and seasons, for the most part certaine and ordinary; unlesse sometimes some more sudden occasion doe now and then pull from him some extraordinary paines; and then in recompence thereof, he at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time may be eased by a neighbour; but is alwaies freed from a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances, whereunto the Physitian is alwaies subject, as by comparing the one profession with the other, may easily appeare. And as for the Lawyer,<note place="margin">And likewise the Lawyer.</note> although he hath this common with the Physitian, that his imploiment is not confined to one place, as is the Divines, yet is he not liable to various and divers inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences whereunto the Physitian is subject. Hee hath his set times at termes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits; and at other times when hee travells in the Countrie to give counsell or keepe courts, hee is never tied to night attendance, but hath a seasonable time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies allowed him for the dispatch of his businesse: and as for other particular incombrances, they are freed from them. Now, if wee compare the recompence of these three severall labourers, we shall find that the Physitian,<note place="margin">Physitians paines of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worse required than of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</note>
      <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> hath still the least share. I am not ignorant of the great difference betwixt that remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and recompence due to ordinary arts and bodily labour: and that which is due to the labour of the minde: the first by ordinary confession, acknowledged that it may be recompenced, but the later by judicious understandings was ever esteemed of an higher nature than could be recompenced by things of an inferiour condition. It hath notwithstanding, by the positive lawes and customes of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beene agreed upon, that some tokens of thankefull remembrance have beene constituted and ordeined for the labours of the learned, according to the severall and divers customes and countries. In this, as likewise all other well-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nations, as the Divines paines are certaine, so is his maintenance in like sort certaine, as it is very equitable and fit it should be: the other two, as their paines are uncertaine, so is their pay. But the Lawyer in this hath the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the Physitian, that he hath the law in his owne hand, whereby such as are not admitted into their societie are kept backe from their barre, and by that meanes reape no benefit of their practice. Besides this, they have still a gap open, whereby they are in possibility to rise to places of higher dignity and eminencie in the common-wealth: and this is with them likewise common to the Clergie: and yet for all this, the Lawyers pay doth often much exceed the Physitians. The Divine hath likewise in his owne hand the sole power of admitting those of his owne profession: and if he admit of unworthy persons, it is his owne fault. As for the Physitian, the Vniversitie indeede doth conferre upon them their titles of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, those I meane of their owne faculty: and some places have yet a custome of re-examination, for avoiding of fraud and deceit, before their admission to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: the which is likewise used by the colledge of Physitians of the honourable City of <hi>London.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Physitians hardiier dealt with than other professions.</note> But the Physitian here is hardlier dealt with than either of the former two: for the Clergie have herein shared with the Physitian, and reteined not only power of admitting some Physitians to practise, but many of them have themselves, without any admission intruded upon their practice, as hath been said alreadie. Now, when the Physitian hath taken all his paines (besides the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages) to attaine to some exellencie in his profession (being in it selfe so penible and laborious) with infinite paines, both of body and minde, and cost and charges; yet still with a hope of recovering his former losses,<note place="margin">Physitians have many snarers with them, which iniuriously rob them of their right.</note> with some competent recompence for his paines past; behold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> to his great griefe, he findes some ignorant Emperick, who never yet suckt in the juice of good learning; some Surgeon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, or woman-physitian, that I say nothing of a medling Minister, often prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him, in this verifying the words of the Wise-man: <hi>I saw servants riding on horse-backe, while Princes goe a foot.</hi> As for the requitall of their paines, although there be divers generous and truly noble spirits, who, howsoever they truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Physitians paines can never be requited, yet are they not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, according to the received custome, to testifie a thankfull acknoweldgement of his love &amp; pains. But againe, many times the Physitian meets with many avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ignorant, sordid base people, who had almost as willingly part from their heart
<pb n="22" facs="19"/>
blood, as from a penny monie, although in danger of life. And many times, for want of understanding, and better breeding, will make as much, yea, more account of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>st ignorant and unsufficient counterfeit-Physitian (provided especially it cost them little, although many times it cost them more than they did ever dreame of) as of the best and ablest Physitian of this Kingdome. And which is yet worse, many without any feare of God, have often recourse to <hi>Wizards, Spelmongers, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators</hi> of <hi>nativities,</hi> and such other forbidden trash. And I cannot but bewaile the blockish stupidity of many of our ignorant country people. Now, notwithstanding all the premisses, both the Divine and the Lawyer have still a doore open for future preferment, whereof there is no hope left the Physitian. But because I have begun to touch upon this string of ingratitude of some persons (yet wishing none to take this in ill part, my meaning being onely to taxe the faulty) to shew that this is not mine owne private opinion alone, neither doth concerne this Kingdome onely, I will set downe the words of a famous <hi>French</hi> Physitian translated out of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, where there is an intire chapter concerning this same subject. <note n="k" place="margin">

      <hi>Ingratitude, or unthankfulnesse, is a very great vice, and odious both to God and man: yea, so great a fault is this, that whoso calleth a man unthankefull, he need give him no worse title, as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all. Now, this fault is growne so common among people towards their Physitians, that I am much amazed, that any man of generous spirit will take upon him this profession, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall so much subject to calumnie and slander, cousin germane to ingratitude. But we meet sometimes with people of reason and understanding, both honest and able to judge of the Physitians sufficiency, which maketh us more able to beare our burthen, and proceed in our profession, notwithstanding, wee meet with a many unthankefull people. For sometimes wee meet with some so courtous and ingenious patients, that will both publikely and privatly professe, that next under God, they hold their life of their Physitian; and having according to their ability and meanes thankefully acknowledged his industrious care and paines, confesse, notwithstanding, freely, that to requite him with a due deserved recompence for his paines, their whole substance would not suffice, as it is true in very deed. For they owe their very life unto the Physitian: and their life is of farre greater value. But the chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence they owe the Physitian, is the good will they still beare him, being ready to pleasure him to power, and still acknowledging their obligation to him for preserving their life. And this is all one, as if any man had taken a sword out of any mans hand, that was ready to kill thee, or a halter out of his hand that was ready to hang thee; wouldst thou not acknowledge such a man for the saver of thy life? Wouldst thou think all thy substance sufficient to requite such a person? Is this then reason, to say, I have paid my Physitian well, yea, it may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid him (a fault seldome committed) having allowed him so much for his daily attendance, and now I am out of his debt. If he hath taken paines with me, I have as well recompenced him for his paines. Alas, I pity thy simplicity and sottish ignorance! that which is given the Physitian, is nothing else but a small token of a thankefull acknowledgement of that helpe and succour thou hast found and received of him: for to requite his labour and paines, especially, if he hath saved thy life (as by the helpe of the Almighty God, hee may doe, and often doth) it is not at all in thy power, unlesse thou shouldst expose the hazard of thy life for him, although he hath not hazarded his life for thine, which, neverthelesse, sometimes hee doth: and thus thou still remainest indebted to him, and must of necessity so confesse.</hi> And againe, a little after. <hi>God delivereth from death, and restoreth us to life by the meanes which the Physitian useth for our helpe and succour. And is not this a worke rather divine than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and which no man can sufficiently requite and recompence? And therefore well was it said by the Wise man: Honour a Physitian with the honor due unto him, for the use which thou may have of him: for the Lord hath created him. For of the most high cōmeth healing, and he shall receive honour of the King. The skill of the Physitian shall lift up his head, and in the sight of great men, he shall be in admiration. Behold then, this is the chiefe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of thankefulnesse due unto him, honour and good will, as a perpetuall bond whereby thou art obliged unto him: and not to be thus perswaded with thy selfe, that thou hast suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently requited his paines with a small summe of monie. But there are some yet of a farre more perverse and wicked disposition than these, who, after they have beene by the honest and industrious care of their Physitian succoured in the time of their greatest need, yet can they not indure to have it said they are beholden to him; and are not farre from hating him, who
<pb n="23" facs="19"/>
hath beene a meanes of saving their lives. O extreme ingratitude! But this is not the day, nor yesterday: for</hi> Hippocrates <hi>bringeth in</hi> Democritus <hi>in his Epistles, speaking after this manner: I thinke,</hi> saith hee, <hi>O</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>that in our profession, many things are subject to calumny, slander and ingratitude. For the sicke, if they escape, ascribe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the Gods, their fortune or good complexion, robbing the Physitian of all the honour and credit due unto him, whom in stead of loving, they often afterwards, hate; as being sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they should be esteemed to have beene beholden to him, &amp;c. And this agreeth as well as may be with the times where in we now live. For sicke people for the most part, ascribe their recovery to some</hi>

      <hi>he or she Saint, to whom they had made some vow, and many times are backward enough to pay their vowes, according to the Italian Proverb:</hi> * <hi>and thus they deale many times with their Physitians, during their sicknesse, promising them golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, pearles and precious stones, or some yeerely pension at least: but being once recovered they are of a farre other mind, pretending many things which furthered their recovery, and in conclusion, ascribing the smallest share of the honour and credit of the recovery to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians care and industrious diligence. And as for all his former faire promises, being now recovered, he begins to thinke with himselfe what his disease hath cost him, and what losse he hath thereby susteined. And thus forgetting his bond and obligation due to his Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, upon whom hee even sometimes laieth the fault of being a cause of some part of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, esteeming it but superfluous and needlesse, and beareth him a grudge for keeping him so long a bed; thinking, that he might in a farre shorter time, and with lesse charges have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him. So that by such a churles account, the Physitian should be ingaged to him: and it is very like, if he might find judges of his minde, and armed with authority, he would bring his action against him, and make him pay for his cost and charges hee had beene at during his sicknesse: And now, behold, is not this a very thankefull acknowledgement of so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? Is there so great ingratitude any where to be found? I thinke not, unlesse in such a case, where some in despaire had hanged himselfe, and some friend of his having cut the cord, and saved his life; this party afterwards would arrest him for his rope: or of some other who having fallen into a deepe water, in danger to be drowned, he that drew him out, had in drawing him forth, torne some piece of his garment, and this party should afterwards sue this saver of his life for reparation of his damage. And thus our debters become our credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to crave of us that which they owe us, and will not so much as have a good conceit of us for all our care in curing them; and will rather after ascribe the credit of the cure to any ignorant person, than to the care and skill of the diligent and industrious Physitian. And this commeth to passe for one of these two reasons: either because they are besotted for want of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts, that they are not able to understand the nature and depth of such a businesse: or else they be such as have wit and understanding enough, but would seeme to take no notice thereof, because they are loth to confesse it, and thankefully, as they ought, to acknowledge the same, and this is the worse of the twaine. Howsoever, it cannot be denied, but this is great ingratitude, and odious both to God and man.</hi> Thus farre this Author, I shall not need to make any comment upon this text, although both my selfe and most, if not all others of this same profession could instance in too many examples of this kind. Nay, is it not a strange thing, that many times, when as a Physitian hath next under God, recovered a patient out of some dangerous disease, yet afterwards shall we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten see the same patient not only neglect his physitian ever after in regard of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thankfull acknowledgement of so great a kindnesse; but afterwards in their need, either for prevention or curation have recourse to others, and these often of very small worth or sufficiency; and as many others, so have my selfe often rasted of this potion. Among others, within these few yeeres, a young man, a
<pb n="24" facs="20"/>
trades-man, living in this towne, falling sicke of that dangerous disease, called <hi>cholera morbus,</hi> wherein was abundance of sharpe choler cast up, this disease being also accompanied with an acute <hi>fever,</hi> which how dangerous it is, the learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian is not ignorant; and the which, although neither himselfe, nor his friends thought likely to be cured, yet by Gods blessing upon the meanes I used, hee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his former health. Being somewhat corpulent, and as in former times, so after now and then obnoxious to the head-ach, fearing also some other infirmities, yet did he never vouchsafe once to aske my counsell, having rather recourse to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son practiser, dwelling some dozen miles off. And this last yeere, 1631. his wife falling sicke of this maligne <hi>fever</hi> now for many yeeres so frequent in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet made he rather use of a Barber-surgeon, and his wife after long languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being at length recovered, himselfe falls immediatly sicke of the same disease, who used still the same counseller, of whom hee had formerly made use for his wife, who after the sight of an amber-coloured urine (as I was told) promised his patient security, who notwithstanding after the indurance of a many daies great extremity, at length paid that debt, which admitteth of no sureties. But of a farre different disposition from the former, is a <note n="*" place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>George Coles</hi> of Northampton gentl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> very good friend and patient of mine, a man of good esteeme and worth within this same corporation, who for these 16 or 17 yeeres, hath made use of no other Physitian but my selfe, either for himselfe or family, besides his extraordinary grateful acknowledgement of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor &amp; paines, still laying hold of the smallest opportunity whereby he may testifie his love. Howsoever, this holdeth firme and sure, that the Physitians paines is the greatest, and his recompence smallest; I meane still <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> making equall comparisons of all circumstances: and I am sure he doth as much for charity as any other profession. And although the ordinary fees of Physitians in this kingdome doe somewhat exceed some other places beyond the Sea (which some have, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though impertinently objected) yet are they but answerable to ordinary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the place wherein they live, and the ordinary pay of Lawyers and others. Besides, that in many places beyond the seas (as in all high and low <hi>Germany</hi>) the Physitians have certaine set stipends allowed them in townes and cities where they live, and a house to dwell in rent-free during their lives; by reason whereof their fees may the better be qualified. Now if any publike persons, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wedded to their owne private, would set this worke a foot, they should, I thinke, finde few Physitians against it. This were farre more worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than their swinish and hellish drunkennesse, and carrousing and quaffing of healths, till health and wealth be both vanished quite away, that I say no worse. And by this meanes also there might bee good Apothecary shops set up in many places of the countrey, to furnish good and sufficient drugges for his Majesties subjects; in many places whereof, by meanes of ill and fusty or sophisticate stuffe, many people are utterly undone; there being none to control these ignorant countrey Apothecaries, nor yet our ordinary Empiricks and ignorant Practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, doing every man what seemeth best in his owne eyes. Many other benefits would from hence arise, if any such worke were undertaken, and the countrey would finde at length that it would quit for cost. But because I have already touched this in another Tractat; and besides, menare so wedded to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that I doubt I speake to the deafe, therefore I will now leave this point, and come to the businesse in hand.</p>

      <note place="margin">Causes mouing the author to undertake this businesse.</note>The cause moving and impelling me to set upon this Tractat following, was an earnest desire I had to free my selfe from that neglect I find fault within others, in not applying themselves to the publike good. And duly considering with my selfe by what part of my profession I might doe the common-wealth most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: as I have beene ready by my practicall paines above these twenty yeeres to helpe the infirmties of the Diseased; so had I resolved with my selfe some yeeres agoe the publication of the dieteticall part of Physicke, or that part which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the diet of healthfull people. But in this being prevented by others, and not willing to give over my former purpose and resolution to publish something that might be profitable for the publike, I bethought me of a path which had not as
<pb n="25" facs="20"/>
yet been beaten by any, which might bee as usefull and profitable, if not more, than the other: and this was to set downe an orderly course of Diet for Diseased persons; which having hitherto been neglected, hath proved the cause of much mischiefe and disorder in diseases. And having now for a long time with <note n="n" place="margin">Iob 32.4.</note>
      <hi>Elihu</hi> waited for mine elders; howbeit farre inferior both in yeeres and understanding to a multitude of learned and able Artists of this Iland, I have been bold to breake this yce, hoping that some abler understandings will after supply my defects: and in the meane time, although I be not furnished with rich treasures of silver and gold, pearle and precious stones; yet by my mite I may testifie and make known my good affection to the publike good.<note place="margin">
         <p>Difficulty of this worke, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
         <p>None of this Iland hath ever written the Diet of the Diseased.</p>
      </note> The difficulty of this taske then may from hence appeare, in that this subject hath seldome been handled by any either anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or moderne Physitians: and none of the natives of this our Iland (who of all others had been best able to set downe such diet as best befitted our sicke; as being best acquainted with the constitutions and other circumstances in such a case fit to be knowne) hath either in our owne vulgar, or any other tongue ever written any tractat concerning this subject. And besides, euen among all our antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, none of set purpose except <hi>Hippocrates</hi> above 200 yeeres agoe, hath hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this subject. And yet setteth he downe but the diet of acute diseases,<note place="margin">

      </note> and that according to that countrey and climat of <hi>Greece,</hi> where he then lived, the which how farre it differeth, even at this day, from the diet of this our Iland both in sicknesse and in health, those who have travelled into those countries, and the learned Physitian are best able to judge. And therefore it may easily appeare that that antient forme of Diet prescribed by him in his daies, did much differ from that of our times, especially of this our Iland, and after the revolution of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres. Another Tractat concerning the same subject was published by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Portugall</hi> in the Latine tongue in the yeere 1544. almost a hundreth yeeres agoe; the which howbeit it was directed to the <hi>English</hi> of those times,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Brudus Lusitanus</hi> di vita febricit. lib. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> yet how short it commeth in many things of that which concerneth the Diet of our Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the learned Physitian is best able to judge; and may partly appeare by that which shall be by us said concerning this subject. Our practicall Writers have indeed here and there set downe some precepts concerning this subject, together with the particular Diet in particular Diseases, and that according to the customes of the countries wherein they lived. Now out of the labours of all these learned men both antient and moderne, as well Physitians as Philosophers, Historians, Poets, &amp;c: have I collected, this subsequent discourse, having accommodated what I have collected to these our countries wherein we live, and our custome of life: and have withall inserted many other things concerning this particular subject both of my owne and others observations, usefull and beneficiall for the sicke and diseased in this our <hi>British</hi> soile, and have not heretofore beene publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And besides, I have here and there as occasion served, discovered and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted some errors of many ignorant and unlearned Practitioners within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and withall, where fit opportunity is offered, I confute divers erroneous opinions held by the vulgar sort of people, and by them falsely mainteined, to the no small prejudice and disadvantage both of healthfull and sicke persons. Now it may perhaps seeme somewhat strange, that I seeme to disclaime the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diet of healthfull persons, and yet notwithstanding, handle the same in my first Booke. I answere, that howsoever I doe indeed handle this subject;<note place="margin">Reasons why the diet of healthfull people is also here handled.</note> yet is it not that I principally aime at; neither yet doe I handle many things in that maner as I would, if this had bin that I principally intended. And indeed my chiefe and principall reason was this, that I thought it very requisite in handling the one to say something of the other. And if we shall seriously consider of it, we shall see some reason for it; the matter of both diets being one and the same, howbeit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring in preparation and some other circumstances, as more fully in its proper place shall appeare. Besides, one finding set downe certaine sorts of Diet, and yet ignorant of the nature and vertue thereof, might be somwhat troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, not knowing how to find out the vertue and efficacy of the same; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end the Reader might be satisfied in his expectation, I thought good
<pb n="26" facs="21"/>
to set downe in the first booke, the nature and vertues of the Diet of the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the which howsoever by others heretofore learnedly handled; yet may the Reader, perhaps here and there find some things, either not heretofore touched, or at least some things cooked after a new manner to set his appetite on edge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there are inserted many both pleasant and profitable problemes, concerning this dieteticall point.<note place="margin">Sum and subiect of this whole subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent discourse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the order and method thereof.</note> And this is the subject of the whole first booke, wherein I thought that fittest, after the order of right method, to precede, which maketh for the explanation and explication of that which followeth. In the second booke I come to that which I principally and first intended, the Diet of the Diseased, where I proceed in order, as may appeare by the titles of the Chapters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Booke, and so proceed in the third and last▪ It is likewise to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that some things concerning all evacuations, but by phlebotomy and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation especially are here particularly and largely discussed, whereby people may the better be enabled to detect and discover the ignorance and unsufficiency of many ignorant persons intruding upon the practice of this profession, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent imposture. The learned and judicious Artist I take not upon me to teach or direct;<note place="margin">The sicke often much wronged by reason of the neglect or want of good directions for Diet.</note> as knowing that were but <hi>Sus Minervam.</hi> My purpose is only to teach the simple, ignorant sort of people, whose credulous simplicity is too often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as a prey to every cheating and ignorant asse. And besides, the vulgar are ordinarily so ignorant of the nature of that which is with them in most frequent use, that they often judge of it farre otherwise than it is indeed. And whereas in some diseases, diet it selfe, if duely administred, might sometimes even cure the disease; and in others accelerate, facilitate and shorten the cure of the same; the patient is often, by reason of the neglect thereof, much wronged, and health much hindered. What person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> of ordinary understanding, if he hath either been sicke himselfe, or yet frequented such places where they have been, but can tell that this is a materiall thing to know, in what time of the disease the sick is to be fed; together with the substance, quantity, order, &amp;c. Give a sicke person food in the height of the paroxysme or fit, and see what will be the successe. The like may be said concerning the due, timely and orderly administration of Phlebotomy, and the use of all manner of other evacuations. And then consider whether this be all that belongeth to the practice of Physick, to exhibit some medicine at randome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, as is the too too frequent custome of many now adayes. I know some will perhaps, greedily gape for some long receits, or remedies against divers diseases.<note place="margin">Better and more lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to set downe the right use of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe new recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ts which may cause the ignorant to erre.</note> But the judicious and understanding may easily conceive, that it is farre better and more excellent to set downe the right use of those already pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, than to set downe a rabble of remedies, which may so easily be abused to the prejudice of a many people. And I dare be bold to affirme, that if all the good and the harme these prostituted medicines have produced, were laied in even scales, the hurt and harme would farre weigh downe the help. If it were possible to set downe remedies with all the severall circumstances, whereby they might be duely accommodated to severall individuall parties as they ought, there were some reason for it. But this was never yet in the power of any mortall man to effect. And therefore, me thinkes, it is farre better to teach the ignorant people, that things without reason are to be ordered and guided by the lawes and rules of reason.<note place="margin">Remedies can never be rightly applied to particular indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall persons, but by the learned Artist, howsoever people are commonly caried a quite contrary way.</note> Those remedies therefore are to be sought for in the learned workes and volumes (which Empiricks and all sorts of ignorant Physitians are never able to attaine unto, and by consequent unfit to practise this profession) of the judicious and learned Physitians of all ages; and can by none but by a judicious understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, trained up in that profession, be duly as they ought accommodated to several individuall parties; <hi>observaris observandis,</hi> with due observation of all the severall circumstances of time, place, person, &amp;c. Hence then may easily be evinced the error and ignorance of such as divulge abroad in the vulgar tongue, their rare secrets (as they call them) against any disease whatsoeuer. I doe not deny, but they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be seconded by some prosperous and successefull issue in some: but that it is but by hap and hazard (as we say) <hi>as the blinde man throwes his staffe;</hi> concerning which, something hath bin said already. But when I see the world use these aright,
<pb n="27" facs="21"/>
they have already, then shall I be both ready and willing to communicate further what I know. My earnest care and indeavour hath ever bin since my first setting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this profession, is, and ever, I hope, shall be to benefit the publike: but by such a course I should rather abuse than benefit any. What my owne paines have beene in this particular worke, I leave to be judged by the judicious and learned; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as have themselves beene no strangers to these labours of the minde, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken especially to be published to posterity, and to remaine upon record for after ages. And whereas I here and there meet with some particular offenders faults or errors, let the publike plead my apologie, whose cause I have here undertaken. And he who is the searcher of all hearts, is my witnesse, that I am farre from hating the persons of any of these offenders, but hate their faults only, and wishing a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where the publike, especially, is so much thereby interessed.<note place="margin">The publike must be preferred before any private person.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as charity is not suspicious, so I hope the honest and ingenuous Reader will interpret my honest indeavours in the best sense. I might, I confesse, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from acting any part in the view of so learned, eloquent and elaborate an age wherein we now live, as is proverbially said, <hi>Obstrepere anser inter olores:</hi> yet having now by experience found, that my former rude labour of so small account, hath found some kinde entetainment abroad, I have been thereby the more imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to proceed to the publication of this worke, which yet, I hope, shall be of some better use. And if this shall find expected acceptation at thy hands, courteous Reader, it shall, I hope, afterwards appeare, so long as God shall preserve health and life, that I shall not with that evill servant, hide my talent in a napkin, but put it forth to the profit of the publike. And whereas I have here insisted me pupon generall directions, if God prolong my life, I may hereafter proceed to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction for the diet in particular and individuall diseases; although there be here many particulars concerning acute diseases set downe. I am not ignorant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that among so great a multitude of judicious and refined understandings, there may occurre divers dainty apitian palates, who will scarce allow of my course cookerie, how dainty soever and wholesome the dish be in it selfe to a hungry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: and some criticke and sharp censuring <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> may, perhaps, condemne both me and my worke. But I shall be no whit thereby discouraged to be a sharer with many betters than my selfe: My chiefe aime and intention, I confesse, hath beene, and is herein to helpe the ignorant and deluded multitude, wherein some of the better sort may, perhaps, be acquainted with something they knew not before: I have for this cause accommodated my selfe as much as in mee was possible, to the understanding of the meanest &amp; most ignorant, whose cause I take here principally upon mee to plead. And yet I have so framed this whole building, that the learned shall finde here and there some marginall refreshings. And although I sometimes handle one and the same thing severall and divers times; yet may it plainly appeare, that this is no tautologie and vaine repetition of things already handled: As water is first handled as an element common to all creatures, and the various divisions, and the utility thereof in generall. It is againe handled as the first and most ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common drinke, together with the severall waies of cooling and correcting the same. In the third place, among severall drinkes of the diseased, this is also menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and whether it may safely be exhibited to sicke people, and when or what may supply the defect thereof; and divers profitable points concerning the same. And in like manner, the aire is in the first booke handled as a common element, with divers other things concerning the sicke, with many other things thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. But lest I prove unmannerly in deteining thee too long in the porch, I shall intreat thee, courteous Reader, now to enter with me into the parlour, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of such homely provision as I could provide for thee, and what is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wanting shall be supplied with a hearty welcome.</p>
