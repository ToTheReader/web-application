   <p>It pleased God Almighty, to make a fearefull Comment on this his owne Text, the very same day it was preached by his vnworthiest seruant. The argument was but audible in the morning, before night it was visible. His holy Pen had long since written it with inke, now his hand of Iustice expounded it in the Characters of bloud, There, was onely a conditionall menace, So it shall be: here a terrible remonstrance, So it is. Sure! He did not meane it for a nine daies won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Their sudden departure out of the World, must not so suddenly depart from the memorie of the World. Woe to that soule that shall take so slight a notice of so extraordinary a Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We doe not say, They perished: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forbid it. But this wee say, It is a signe of Gods fauour, when hee giues a man Law. Wee

passe no sentence vpon them, yet let vs take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by them. The Remarkablenesse would not be neglected▪ for the Time, the Place, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Number, the Maner. Yet still wee conclude not, This was for the transgression of the dead: but this we are sure of, It is meant for the admonition of the liuing.</p>
   <p>Such is our Blessed Sauiours conclusion, vpon a paralel instance: <hi>Except ye repent, YE shal all LIKEWISE perish.</hi> There is no place safe. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ough for offenders: but when the Lord is once vp in armes, happy man that can make his owne peace! otherwise, in vaine we hope to runne from the Plague, while we carry the Sinne along with vs. Yet will not our wilfull and bewitched Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, from these legible Characters, spell Gods plaine meaning. No impression can bee made in those hearts, that are ordained to perish. For their malicious, causelesse, and vnchristian censures of vs, God forgiue them: our requitall be onely pitie and prayers for them. Howsoeuer they giue out, (and I will not here examine) that their piety is more then ours: Impudence it selfe cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but our Charitie is greater then theirs. Now the holy feare of God keepe vs in the wayes of Faith and Obedience; that the properation of Death may neuer preuent our preparation to die. And yet still, after our best endeauor; <hi>From sudden death good Lord deliuer vs all.</hi> Amen.</p>
