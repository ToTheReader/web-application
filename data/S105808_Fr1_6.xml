      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous and wise, whose iudgements (not entangled with enuie) enlarge the deserts of the Learned by your liberall censures; vouchsafe to welcome your scholler-like Shepheard with such V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie entertainement, as either the nature of your bountie, or the custome of your common ciuilitie may affoord. To you he appeales that knew him <hi>ab extrema pueritia,</hi> whose <hi>placet</hi> he accounts the <hi>plaudite</hi> of his paines; thinking his daie labour was not altogether lauisht <hi>sine linea,</hi> if there be anie thing of all in it, that doth <hi>olere atticum</hi> in your estimate. I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is growen of late; so that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie moechanicall mate abhorres the english he was borne too, and plucks with a solemne periphrasis, his <hi>vt vales</hi> from the inkhorne: which I impute not so much to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of arts, as to the seruile imitation of vainglorious tragoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who contend not so seriouslie to excell in action, as to embowell the clowdes in a speach of comparison; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themselues more than initiated in poets immortalitie, if they but once get <hi>Boreas</hi> by the beard, and the heauenlie bull by the deaw-lap. But herein I cannot so fully bequeath them to follie, as their idiote art-masters, that intrude thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to our eares as the alcumists of eloquence; who (moū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the stage of arrogance) think to outbraue better pens with the swelling bumbast of a bragging blanke verse. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it may be the ingrafted ouerflow of some kilcow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, that ouercloieth their imagination with a more than drunken resolution, beeing not extemporall in the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of anie other meanes to vent their manhood, commits the disgestion of their cholerick incumbrances, to the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious volubilitie of a drumming decasillabon.

Indeede I must needes say, the descending yeares from the Philosophers <hi>Athens,</hi> haue not been suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such present Orators, as were able in anie English vaine to be eloquent of their owne, but either they must bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row inuention of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> and his Countreymen, take vp choyce of words by exchange in <hi>Tullies Tusculane,</hi> and the Latine Historiographers store-houses; similitudes, nay whole sheetes and tractacts <hi>verbatim,</hi> from the plentie of
