      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, it is concluded (for our parts, whatsoeuer our aduersaries affirme), that there are but two ends for all men at the last; either life, or death; saluation, or condemnation. Then from this truth I collect this necessary position; that, All men are either tending to the one, or trudging to the other. If thou bee in the narrow path (which is comfortable), these few lines will yeeld thee some (though little) roome, ease and ability, to goe on with the more cheerfulnesse; the which to a wearie, and almost tyred traueller, cannot but giue good content: But, if thou be in the broad (which is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful), they may, through the good hand of God, be of force to cause thee smite thy hand vpon thy thigh, and alter thy iourney: For the producing of either which effects, was the cause I first preached it; and now since (though requested) haue penned it. Who knoweth not the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of mans will: how improne it is to run after the rule of Gods commands? And what mā, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth that Good or Euill be the proper obiects for to moue and allure it to turne the perfect way? Then this being truth, reade these (though ragged) lines; for they will giue thee to see into many mysteries, secret things, that be in the course of godlinesse; and declare vnto
<pb facs="5"/> thee, what thing is profitable for all things; so that, if thou canst but obtaine one thing, thou shalt want nothing. Thou thinkest this a hard matter: Well, bee it so: yet reade on, and then consider, consult, and giue sentence.</p>
