   <head>¶The Prologe vnto the Christen Reader.</head>
   <p>HEre hast thou Christen Reader the sentences and iudgementes of the excellent and godlye lernyd men / Henry Bullynger / wyth all the lerned men of the church of Tygury / and also the sentence and iudgement of Ihon Caluyne of Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ua / Whether a Christen man may lawfully cōmuny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or be pertaker with the Masse and ceremonyes of the Papystes / without offendyng God and hys neygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boure or not. Therfore haue I set forth this epistle of those godly and lernyd men / to the intent that thou mayest the better knowe what ydolatrye is / and wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in it consisteth / wherby also thou mayst the better ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and knowe how to auoyde it: Consyderinge that it is the greatest offence that may be commytted a gaynst God. For it is forbydden in the fyrst commaundemēt / sayenge: Thou shalt haue no nother goddes but me. Also all the holy Prophetes of God euer cryed out thervpon. And agayne it is manyfest thorow the hole Byble how greuouse a synne it is / by the greuousnes of the plages with the which God euer plagyd the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of Israel therfore. But here some wyll answere and saye: We know that ydolatrye is a greuouse syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / and sore dyspleaseth God: But wyll yow saye that the holy Masse and Ceremonyes that haue bene vsed in the church thys many hundryd yeares / and also set vp by holy counsayles be wycked / and that men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte ydolatrye by vsyng of them?<note place="margin">Deut. xij. Deut. iiij Deut. v</note> To that I answere that what so euer lawe or Ceremonye / the church hath made or set vp / &amp; the same not expressed in the worde of God / it owght not to be alowed / folowed / nor kept: For God commaunded the chyldren of Israel / Deuter. xij. that they shoulde not do euery man what thynketh hym good in his own eyes? And agayne Deuter .iiij. Ye shall put no thinge to the worde of God / nor take no thinge therfrom. And agayne in the .v. chap. of the same boke. Take hede therfore that yow do as the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de your God hath commaundyd you: and tourne not asyde / nether to the ryght hande nor to the lyfte: but walke in all the wayes which the Lorde thy God com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundyd the. &amp;c. Now wher can it be founde in any worde of God / the inuencyon of the Papistes Masses / or that ymages ought to be in churches / or soch lyke.

      <note place="margin">Roma. vi</note> Therfore do I exhorte the Chrysten Reader / whatsoeuer thou be that shall reade this epistles of thes godlye lernyd men / that thou wilt folowe s.

And consyder what a godlye lesson s. Paul geueth his Corinthiās in the second epistle the .vi. cha. sayeng: Beare not the yocke with the vnbeleuers: for what felowshyp hath righteousnes with vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / what cōpany hath lyght with darknes / what cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde hath Christ wyth Belyall / ether what part hath he that beleueth with an infydell / how agreith the tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God with the ymages: For ye are the temple of that lyuyng God / as sayd God: I wyll dwell amonge them / &amp; walke amonge thē / &amp; wilbe their God / &amp; they shalbe my people: wherfore come out of the middes of them (sayeth the Lorde) &amp; touch none vncleane thinge: so wyll I receyue you / &amp; wilbe a father vnto you / &amp; ye shalbe my sonnes and doughters sayeth the Lorde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.<note place="margin">ij.

their strength: but will in the middes of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon make a waye to escape out. That is / yf thou put thy hole trust onely in hym / seking onely his glorye &amp; prayse in all that thou goest about / he wyll (I saye) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to his acustomable mercyes delyuer the: ether by blyndynge the eyes of thyne aduersaryes / that they shall take no hede of the:<note place="margin">Dani. i.</note> or els geue the fauour in the syght of them as he gaue Danyel with the .iij. yonge men fauour in the sight of the keper / whē they were in captyuyte / because they had determyned with thē selfes to kepe thē vndefiled.<note place="margin">Tobi. i</note> And also gaue Tobias fauour in the sight of the Kyng Salmanaser / with ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other / as Ioseph / Ieremy. &amp; c: Or elles yf they espye the / he shall geue the strength to glorifye his name by suffryng for his truth / as he hath done many holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes / Apostles &amp; martyrs / whose hope and trust was onely in the resurreccyō. And for that cause the mother with her .vij. sonnes dyd chose to suffer cruell tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; martyrdome / rather then they wold eate swynes flesh that was forbydden in the lawe / not fearyng the tyrauntes that coulde do no more but kyll the bodye / beleuynge and sayenge that God wold rayse them vp agayne / which dye for his lawes in the resurreccyō of euerlastynge lyfe.<note place="margin">ij.

Chapter / the which yf thou do marke with a syngle eye / I put no dowbt but thou shalt easely perceyue how greatlye all maner out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde symulacyon of wyckednes doth displease God / and therfore also how greately euery Christen man ought to abhorre it.<note place="margin">ij.

   <p>Thus I commyt the Christen reader to the defence &amp; kepyng of the most hygh God / whych dwellyth not in temples made wyth hādes / nether is woshypped with mens inuencyons / but whose seate is the heauens / and the earth his fote stole / as sayth the prophet / that with the breth of his mouth shall dystroye all antychrystes with all ther venemus lawes that hath coriupt &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonyd the precyos soule of man.<note place="margin">Act. vij.</note>
