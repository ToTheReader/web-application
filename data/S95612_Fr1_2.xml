   <head>To the Right Honourable, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Lord Chiefe Iustice of his Maiesties Court of Common Pleas, <hi>Thomas Tymme</hi> wisheth all happinesse in this life, and in the world to come true felicitie in Christ Iesus.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S that famous <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> another <hi>Apelles,</hi> intending to limme in her naturall colours the picture of <hi>Iuno,</hi> selected fiue of the most beautifull Virgins that were in all Agrigent, that from the comely feature of those, in each part, he might portray a compleate and most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able picture: so in like manner (right Honourable) I purposing to set Dame <hi>Nature</hi> vpon the Stage of the world, in each limme well fashioned, out of Matter and Forme, haue taken her linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Art and wisedome of the more learned sort of Philosophers, that in all her parts (so well as I could) she might stand faire and well composed to the common view, of such espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as can discerne and iudge, a property not common to all. For euery plummet is not for euery sound, nor euery line for all leauels; neither is it possible out of euery blocke to make the sculpture of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> no more then it is possible for euery one without a conuenient Bucket, to draw water from the depth of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well.</p>
   <p>But your Lordship being in all humane Science profoundly learned, and of mature Iudgement (as hath appeared by effect) can with <hi>Protogenes,</hi> discipher <hi>Apelles</hi> worke, by the draught of one onely line, and can by your sublimed wisedome discerne the misterie of Matter and Forme.</p>
   <p>And to the end your Honour may the better feele my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="3"/>herein, I haue reduced (as it were) innumerable beames to one Sunne, and many Riuers to one Fountaine, abridging large discourses into a conuenient compendium and methode.</p>
   <p>But seeing no Pomegranat can be so faire, but that some one imperfect and rotten kernell may be found therein, I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Honour to deale with such occurent faults, as <hi>Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries</hi> are wont to deale with precious stones, who to hide a cracke or flaw, doe set the same more deepe in gold. So (my right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord) let your Noble name and High reputation of learning and sage prudence, shaddow and adorne my imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this Treatise. Wherein, albeit you finde not an Eagles nest, no more then <hi>Theseus</hi> did (notwithstanding through faire promises he had long looked for it) yet happily your Honour, at the least shall finde a Wrenne, and then at the last you may say you haue a Bird.</p>
   <p>Now fearing least I paesse the due limits of proportion, as did the Myndians, who made their gates greater then their Towne, I cease to stay your Lordship from your Honourable affaires, crauing pardon for this my boldnesse, and beseeching God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your dayes and yeeres with desired health, to your ioy and comfort, and to the good of this Church and Common-wealth of great Britaine.</p>
