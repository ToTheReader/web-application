To this we ought to endeuoyre our

And in the thyrde cyrcle<note place="margin">The thyrde Cyrcle.</note> must al the comen

princes if they be not al the best / must not
with chyding be exasperate / leste (as saint
Augustyne saythe) whan they be moued
they styrre vp more peryllous tragedyes / 
so the weake people lyke as Christ suffred

haue euery one his propre place /

Therfore the marke muste be sette before
euery man whiche they ought to shote

there be nothyng whervnto a man ought

whiche is best and moste perfyte<note place="margin">Al must labour to perfytnesse.</note> / that at

   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>The perfectyon of Christ consisteth onely
in the affectes / &amp; not in the maner or kynde

There be amonge the monk{is} whiche

amōgest these that haue had two wyues

do no wronge to any maner of lyuyng or
professyon / though I propounde and set

any man that went so farre forwarde / but
that he might haue gone moch more nere

but it hath some peryllous poyntes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

els but a goyng a syde in to a secrete

And anone after the maner of lyuynge of
religyous men whiche folowed thē / was
nothyng els but a reformacyon &amp; callyng
agayne to Christ: for the courtes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the olde tyme shewed them christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their tytles / rather than in their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng.
The bysshoppes anone after were
corrupt with ambycion &amp; couetousnesse /

dyd abate and decrease.<note place="margin">From whence cyremonyes came.</note> And
nowe althoughe we se men of relygyon
to be ouermoche out of good ordre / and
to vse maners lyke vnto gentyles / yet is
the worlde fylled with newe instytucions

shulde not fall to the same poynte here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
