   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR so much (right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) as the Catholickes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes of this Nation beeing, though distressed members, yet truely members of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke Body, which this high and honorable court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament doth represent, haue now for a great part of this last declining age, bene (contrarie to all example of former times) excluded from their accustomed places and voices therin: and continuing yet vnder such estate, are therby depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all ordinary meanes to moue or answere for them selues, when and where it doth most concerne them: It cannot (I hope) seeme iustly greeuous or offensiue to any, that being in these straights, and destitute of all other aduocates they should mediate the appeasing of their former pressures and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by their owne most humble and earnest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.

Yet could I not but censure his other intendment of suppressing the same for no lesse then extreame, and fitt to be preuented: as houlding it vnworthy, that so great paines &amp; of such publicke profite, should for his priuate satisfaction be wholly suppressed and buried in silence. For which cause I haue aduentured though (in regard of the reason before signified) not to offend or trouble his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie therwith; yet to dispose therof in an other course and so publishing the same (without the Authors
<pb facs="8"/> assent) to offer it (with all humble and due respecte) to your most honorable and graue considerations. For whom other may we in the cōfidence and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our cause importune rather then your selues, being the honorable Peers, and graue Sages of our noble Nation? vpon whom (next vnto his MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTIE the charge of redressing our miseries is most properly incumbent. Vouchsafe therfore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech you, to view euen with charitable and Christian commiseration, our present estate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition described to you in this treatise, and in like maner to waigh the reasons and motiues to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie therin set downe, which are many and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
