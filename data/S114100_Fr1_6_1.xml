   <p>OR rather to the Title: if it be so much.<note place="margin">Ʋax faucibus haeret.

Hath he taken so soone and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly his hand from the worke? what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? doth griefe thrattle him, &amp; his spirit burne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him? either doth his memorie forsake him? or his heart smite him? Cannot <hi>Balaam</hi> vtter his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because God will not giue him leaue to curse his people? what motion? what passion is this? what Lethargie? what Apoplexie possessed the braine of this Priest, that beginning a sentence, hee was not able to bring it forth. Belike the Diuell ought him a fowle shame, to trip him downe on the threshold: &amp;
<pb facs="8"/> cut off both his head and his hands here; for both his wit and his fingers faild him in this entrance. Or was it not the Angell of the Lord of hoasts that stood in <hi>Balaams</hi> way to forbid him? nay, to rebuke and controwle his conscience in this wicked course and Treatise; and yet to suffer him to go on forward withall. Christian Reader, marke I pray you, if this be not very memorable, that this false Embassador is made to speake, and not to speake: to begin, and not to make an end, like a cravin Cocke that begins to crowe, and stops vpon a sodaine.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>To you, oh you miserable, &amp;c.</hi> What doth hee say to them? Nay: that is abrupted, either by the failing of his memorie, or by the feeling of his conscience: or by both. As he that came vpon the Stage, when he had said <hi>(Vtinam ne in nemore)</hi> was able to go no farther: so this praun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Priest directing an Epistle to all Schismaticks, meaning, his Catholique minded that come to our Churches, beginning at first more like a franticke &amp; furious Herauld, then a sober &amp; prudent Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to rayle at them, is choked as it wereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as chasing and cholerick spirits vse to bee in their overhasty fumes, not able to deliuer one perfect Period. But <hi>A Domino factum est istud,</hi> this was the Lords doing, that he became so speechlesse vppon a sodaine.<note place="margin">

<hi>hitherto shalt thou come, and here shall it stay thy proude waues;</hi> gaue a notable forewarning to this blasphemer, hitherto to range, &amp; here to breake off his prowde words: if
