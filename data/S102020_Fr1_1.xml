   <p>TWo treatises yee haue heere ensuing (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in Christ) which yee must read without

you shal neither see their meaning:
nor refraine youre selues from rashlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of them, withoute infre cause. For certaine
men there are of great countenaunce, whiche will not
lightly like of them, bicause they principally concerne
theyr persons and vaiusre dealings: whose credite is
greate, and whose freendes are manye, we meane the
Lordly Lords, Archbishops, Bishops, Suffraganes
Deanes, Vniuersitie Doctors, and Bachelers of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
Archdeacons, Chaūcelors, and the rest of that
proud generation, whose kingdome must down, hold
they neuer so hard: bicause their tyrannous Lordship
can not stande<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 15. 13 Luke. 16. 15</note> with Christes kingdome. And it is
the speciall mischefe of our Englishe churche, and the
cheefe cause of backewardnesse, and of all breache and
dissention. For they whose authoritie is<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 20. 25. 26. Math. 23. 8. 9. 10. Mark. 10. 4.2. 43. Lu. 22. 15.</note> forbidden
by Christ, will haue theyr stroke without their fellow
seruaūts, yea, though vngratiously, cruelly and Pope-like
they take vpon them to<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 24. 48. 49.</note> beat them, and that for
theyr owne childishe Articles, being for the most part
against the manifest truthe of God: First, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
theyr rigoure hathe too plainely appeared euer

which with suche rigoure they maintaine these

Only y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> authors of those, thought it their parts
to admonish you at this time, of those inconveniences
which men seme not to thinke vpon, and which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

howe so euer learned and many they seeme to be, they
