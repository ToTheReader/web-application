   <head>To all those Gentlemen, that are worthily so reputed.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN, that you might the rather know your selues to be Gentlemen, I haue endeuoured these lines, wherein I haue distinguished of Gentlemen, both currant and counterfeit: I call them currant, that are wel known to be Gentlemen by discent, or haue been otherwise aduā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by desert▪ eyther by seruice in the field, or by any other vertuous indeauour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ending to the generall good of the common wealth.</p>
   <p>I call them counterfeit, that do vsurpe the name &amp; title of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are lately crept out of a thatcht house, or from the dunghil, by scraping together alittle pelfe, that haue neither petigree, vertue, nr honesty, whereby to make claime, and yet will intrude themselues and take more vpon them then becommeth basenes. I hope I shall neither off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd the honest, nor discontent the wise: for the rest, if they be a little rubd ouer the gaule, let them kicke in Gods name. Hee that cannot endure the reprehension of Sinne, let him neuer goe to Church, and he that cannot abide to heare folly reproued, let him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reade Bookes. But as mistres Minx is many times sicke, but shee cannot tell where: so there be some would fame finde fault if they could tell how: but for him that is of the reprehending humour, here is matter for him to worke vpon. My lines are like the Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers leather, that if a man complains of a straite shoo, they will swear one daies wearing will make it retch, againe, if they be too wide, they will say the leather will shrink in the wearing: so my lines according to the disposition of the Reader, may be made either too short or too long: for although I haue fitted them to mine own fantasie, yet I know I cannot fit them to euerie mans humor▪ In the same pasture where the Bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>eazeth on the flower, the oxe feedeth on the shrub: so readers some like Bees, and some like Oxen, do conuert things indifferent to particular qualities, for what the one cōuerts to honey, the other turus to gall. <hi>Xenophon</hi> was wont to say, that if beasts could paint, they would pourtray God himself like a beast: so the ignorant sort, that wil draw all thinges to their own appetites, and but to what themselues do affect, will make those expositions of any thing they read, as the writer himselfe neuer thought vpon: and as they will not let to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise those things that they could neuer conceiue: so they wil praise that againe which they neuer vnderstood. We haue too many of these expositors, that can wrest generalities to priuate applications: I wold b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> glad to blesse my self from them: but if I cannot escape them, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>re is the lesse, because it is not my case alone, when it is generall to as many as haue had to doe with the printing presse.</p>
