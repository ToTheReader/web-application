in their minds an ardent burning desire of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, if not matching, or ouergoing the most glorious attempts, of the greatest &amp; most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. In regard whereof, the memorable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, deedes, and indeuours, of the wisest, most learned, and most valiant of all ages, haue bene still committed to writing, and left to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in all ciuil Countries, to be as whetstones for the wittes of other to come, and as spurres to pricke forward vnto fortitude and magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And, to this purpose, not only true Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue alwayes beene published, but many fictions of admirable and most straunge, yea of incredible things atchieued by industrious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and constancy in Louers. If then faigned stories of martiall men and louing Ladies, may be necessary and delightfull, how much more profitable and pleasaunt may this History bee deemed, which compriseth both rare and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie feates of Chiualry great store, and also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wonderfull euents brought to passe by the stedfast faithfulnesse of true Louers: and this story, in respect of the subiect, is verie true, howsoeuer in the circumstances, some poeticall paintings &amp; hyperbolical praises may be found.

And whereas before time, the Translator Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Caxton, being (as it seemeth) no English man, had left very many words mere French, and sundry sentences so improperly Englished, that it was hard to vnderstand, we haue caused them to bee made plainer English: and if lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure had serued, wee would haue had the same in better refined phrases, and certaine names that bee amisse, conferred with Authours, and made right. But if wee finde your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accepting heereof to be such, as wee may shortly haue a second impression, we will haue all amended.</p>
