the most sorts

I am to publish in print, to my

my worshipfull friends) my recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made at Paules Crosse, considering
with my selfe that in causes Ecclesiastical,
the gouernment is giuen by God, (next

grace, and because the matter here trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of is such, I thought it most conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

to offer the same to your grace, vnto
whom both I and my labours do of dutie
on our partes (next vnto her highnesse, by
whose gracious clemencie and mercy we
haue that we liue) chiefly belong, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose protectiō we may safely walke
without feare of controll, and both our
wants be more then sufficiently furnished
by your graces countenance and fauour,
which haue hitherto bene alwayes ready
to helpe those that haue relied thereupon,
the which vndeserued grace (whereof I
nothing doubt) if your honourable good
lordship doe affoord me, I shall be further
emboldned without dismay, to put foorth
to vse my masters talent, which hitherto
hath lien hidden in a napkin without any
maner of gaine: and if the commoditie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to any thing, your graces portion
no doubt, will be therein double; in this
world increase of vertue &amp; honour, things
according with your high calling &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
profession, and after this life eternall
happinesse wherewith God will crowne
in you all his works, your graces labours,
which God graunt for his mercies sake,
through his onely sonne Iesus Christ.</p>
