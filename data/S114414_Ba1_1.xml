   <head>AN ADDITION, TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>MEANE whyle the precedent confutation was on the printers presse, there came out of Englād a printed pamphlet of <hi>Squyres</hi> forged conspiracie, as a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed vnto a gentleman at <hi>Padua.</hi> And albeit Maister M. A. in this his confutation hath well and sufficiently confuted that fiction, yet is it not vnnecessary to ad a few lynes in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this pamphlet.</p>
   <p>First it is therefore considerable, that whereas this fiction of Squyers, beeing with such asseueration plotted &amp; pursued, &amp; himself condemned and executed: and the odiousnesse of the pretended cryme so much sounded out, both from the <hi>Bench,</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> why yet after all this there should need any pamphlet, to giue new credit to the matter? Hereof the reason forsooth is no other, but that the forgers in this mint were afrayd least els their coyne would be the more suspected to be counterfait and so the lesse go for good payment.</p>
   <p>And the rather for that Squyre himself when he came to the conclusion of the matter, to wit, when he was to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, did there die a true protestant, &amp; vtterly denied the acting of any such thing, and such protestations, and at such tymes, do comonly make strong impressions in the myndes of the people, who generally are giuen to belieue, that at the very last instant of lyf, men are lykelyest to declare the truth of their causes.</p>
   <p>And more-ouer seeing many of the wyser sorte beeing enured to the noting of such packings (as this might easely seeme vnto them to bee) do vse narrowly to watch &amp; obserue, how thinges passe at arraignements, and might well see that the course &amp; manner of this seemed rather some such matche as <hi>Kemp</hi> and his compagnions do handle on the stage, then the lyuely managing of a matter of truth in deede, which neuer would haue needed such a playerlyke corespondence in the actors, for euen as <hi>Kemp</hi> and his fellowes hauing before-hand studied to con their partes by roate, and each knowes to keepe his cu, and to frame his speech and manners according to his fayned function, euen so was this fore-studied tragedy
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>
acted in Westminster hall. Where first one playd the prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and told a long and lamentable tale of the horriblenesse of the fayned fact. Another burst out in teares, and very pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wept at it. An other fell in to admiration of the greatnes of the miracle, making it in effect, as very a miracle, as euer <hi>Christe</hi> wrought any: and <hi>Squyer</hi> himself that was to make good earnest of all the iest, was held in a tale whyle some good parte of his indightment was red, to the end he should heede it the lesse, and so the lesse reply against it. This then beeing easely to bee noted, and that Squyer in the end prooued the foole that mard the play, by denying the acte at his death (as aforesaid) and so consequently the great miracle <hi>yf euer there vvene a miracle.</hi> No maruel then is it that a smooth penned pamphlet is now come abrode, to reuyue the decaying credit of this late-made-matter, rather then that it should be holpen vp, by the rymings of some od pot-poet or idle balletmaker.</p>
   <p>The wryter whereof (yf it bee <hi>M. Smokey-svvynes. flesh,</hi> at the instance of Sir R. C.) presumes so much vpon the faith of the reader, who he hopeth will beleeue him, that he telleth him so direct and redy a tale, as though himself had bene in euery place, at euery tyme; when, and where, the matter was delt in, or spoken of: or els that he hath had his intelligence by espetiall reuelation, for that he seemes to knowe all, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, and so perfectly, yea he knowes now to call the Iesuyte in Spaine, Richard Walpole, that so often in the indightment was William Walpole. And moreouer he knowes that the said <hi>Richard Walpole is a man of principall credit in Spaine, and as Vicar generall to Persons in his absence,</hi> which is a point in deede that must argue the mānes knowledge to be supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, because he knowes that, that no man els knowes: but yet to knowe it better (as also some pointes and circumstances in relating actes of Catholique religion) he were better to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy some one spie more sufficient then it seemes he hath any: <hi>Vnum est necessarium,</hi> by which sentence (by himself repeated) he may correct his ignorances and so make his pamphlets hereafter to be the lesse laughted at, If withall he leaue out such bald notes, as that <hi>Squyer</hi> squeezed out the poyson out of his dooble bladder in the sight and presence of diuers, and
<pb facs="15"/>
therewithal did say God saue the Queene, for this also makes the matter smell further of then the poison could infect.</p>
   <p>Further it is to be noted (as the indyghtement, &amp; this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter both testifie) the poison was deliuered vnto Squyer in a dooble bladder, that is, in one bladder within another, and this he pricked with holes, and squeezed on the pomel of the Queenes sadle, and the sadle as the pamphleter sayth, being on the back of the horse, and the horse standing in the stable yard (for that the Queen was redy to ride abroad) it would be knowen how <hi>Squyer</hi> did, to auoyd his owne harme by the poison, that now by the squeezing of the bladder, and straining it through, must needs be left sticking on the outside: and this marueil is the greater, for that Squyer must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, haue donne it with a tryce, and therfore could haue no leasure (for fear of being noted by the lookers on) to put it into a new bladder or vessell (for that he was to reserue the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this poyson for the Earle of Essex chaire) and therefore thrusting the bladder all wet on the outside into his pocket on the sudden, and yet to get no parte of the poyson, vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or his clothes, is a great merueil, and to get parte vpon him and to haue no harme, may be deemed a miracle, but to auoyd this question, if the pamphleter had remembred so much, he should either haue sayd that Squyer had had skill in iugling, and could deceaue their sightes that looked on, or els that the sadle was in a corner in the stable where he was alone by him self, and not on the horses back in the open yeard, and the sight of many, for now a miracle may bee presupposed to be wrought vpon the horse also, yf any of the poyson squeezed out on the sadle pomell did light vpon him, as very lykely it must, because the pomell is round and such a substance as may be strayned through holes pricked with a pin in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will easely run downe a sadle pomell. And by this reason must ensew, miracle vpon miracle (fowre at the least) yf all be well remembred. And it is also a maruell (though no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) that neither the Queenes sadle, nor the Earles chaire, were presented at the bar, because in all lykelyhood the stayn or signe of so forcible a poison should be found to remaine vpon the one or the other, at least to grace the matter some <hi>aqua fortis</hi> or <hi>alcumisticall distillation</hi> might haue bene wyped
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
on both, or one, in steede of a pretended poison, and so might the sadle and chaire haue bene reserued for remembrance of so many great miracles, and well woorthy: yf this had bene remembred, as in good earnest it would haue bene, yf it had bene a true donne thing in deede, or that the prosecuters of this matter had belieued it themselues, or had better fayned, to haue belieued it.</p>
   <p>But to leaue these ouersightes to such as must take better heede to them heerafter, I will heer draw to an end, and tell the pamphleter, that he doth serue his Paduan frend but by peecemeal: for seeming to go roundly to woork with him, &amp; to tel him a full tale without stop, and yet to leaue out the later and chief parte of all, which was played by the principall actor Squyer himself, to wit, in not telling how he ended the matter at Tiburne, and how he there made two denials, the one of Catholique religion, declaring himself a perfect prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and the other of his practisment of poyson, all which I say to be left behinde sticking in his pen, must needes be but a sly trik of his, and howsoeuer his frend do accept ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or of his excuse therof, likely it is that he wil be so wise, as not once to tel-the contentes of his said letter so any of the Italians, least he be well laughed at for his labour, for they are to wise for him to delude with flimflammes, and to wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ridiculous rumors of English Queen-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges. Some poore fooles in England that know nothing, may do them the pleasure to beleeue it for them.</p>
   <p>They can tel him, and tel him truly, of the cruel and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomarie killing that is vsed in England, which now a dayes (for the bloodinesse thereof) is become the most sad spectacle of the vniversal world.</p>
   <p>They can tel him, how when by the open force of malyce they list not to take away mennes liues, that then they can do it by sleight, deceit, and coosinage, and yet stil with exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior face and shew of Iustice, and for proof of this, we need not seek ouer our histories of former ages.</p>
   <p>They can tell of the great numbers of innocent priestes, and Catholique men, that for old faith and religion, vnder pretence of new treason, are made subiect to so many and so great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and lastly to most cruell death: and this both by Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
<pb facs="16"/>
and sundry other nations is published to the world in their seuerall languages.</p>
   <p>And who knoweth not, and seeth not, that it is a comon custome, before any new storme is raised vp of persecuting Catholiques, more violently then ordinary, that then some pretence is made of the discouery of some great treason, against the Queenes person.</p>
   <p>Valentyn Tomson his matter of Queene-killing had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented Squyres, yf he had come aswell from Spaine as he did from Scotland, and that he could haue said that he had seene and spoken with a Iesuite, though he knewe him not so familiarly, as to know his name.</p>
   <p>This world is now growne ouer well acquainted with these tales of Queen-killings, as also that those brutes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions to the killing of such innocent seruants of God as lighte into the hands and power of the blood-thirsty and are by them alloted to the slaughter, whose glorie both in heauen and earth wilbe the greater, in that their paynes are inflicted with dooble wrong. And when the <hi>Notorious actes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice of England,</hi> shal come to be published in a large volume, to the view of the world, and to the admiration of after-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming posteritie (the hastening Whereof the cruelty of the persecuter may enforce) then shal sundry fraudulent practises, and many bloody tragedies, be reuealed, and those not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from secret murthers, and with sufficient proofes and arguments for the vtterance of truth, and far different from that which cogging pamphleters and fond baletmakers do divulge in the meane tyme whyle truth keepeth sylence.</p>
