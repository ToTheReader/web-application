   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HERE AS MEN</hi>
are now a days here
in England glutted
as it wer with gods
worde, &amp; therfore al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>most
ready to vomit
vp again y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which thei haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
lothing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sermōs &amp; despising
the preachers, some turning to cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious
arts, &amp; som cōtemning al ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
&amp; sciences, som Epicures, som
Atheistes, &amp; few or none do stand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forth
as fathers to vs yonglings
to byd vs folow their fotesteppes
in vertues and godlines: We the
youth of this realme are drawen
into diuers and sundrye doubtfull
wayes aud wandering bypathes,
and many of vs by pouerty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
calamities are oppressed at
our first breathing &amp; either know
not which way to directe our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
or els want helpe to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
and are cut of in the fyrste
<pb facs="3"/>
herbe accordyng to the Prouerbe.
This is one thyng also that gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs: we see them that are wise
and learned altogether contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and despised, and thei often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
are compelled to go and seke
to the riche and noble mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but the riche wyl not come to
their houses nor greatly delyte in
their companies. And thogh thys
be some cause that<note n="‡" place="margin">Petrus Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus lib. 7. 14. de ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesta disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina.</note> Aristippus
answered to Dionisius why the
learned doe haunte the houses of
the rich and the wise many times
go &amp; seke to the wealthy and not
they to the contrary: for that the
wise doe knowe what the riche do
want and the welthy worldlings
can not se their want, as he saith.
Yet in these our tymes we maye
find other matters that cōpelleth
thē to seke to such as be in power
&amp; autoritie. For iniquitie doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde
in these latter dayes and
the pore ar oppressed by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And as I doe here mine elders
<pb facs="3"/>
talke. The lawes are good to right
the wronges, but lawyars do not
their duties. Iustice is good, but
the Iustyces care not for poore
mens causes. Officers are enowe
and wel prouided for in all places
but these officers vnderstand not
their office and duty or yf they do
vnderstand it, they will not do it,
&amp; which is the worste of all, when
thei do it not, thei may not be told
of it, especially by a man that is
learned in gods worde. For what
cā he skyl of ciuil offices say these
politike officers. Thus is the rule
of all equitie openly contemned.
Therefore not seyng wherevnto
in this my youth I could direct my
studies yet neither wheri I cold be
better occupied both for mine own
learning, and for the instructiō of
such politike men as wil vochsafe
to read heathen writters, though
they regard not the scriptures: I
haue trāslated as I could into our
natiue language, the notable epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb facs="4"/>
of that famous wise and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
man M. Tullius Cicero vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his brother Quintus, wherein
iustice and the right vse of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is so wel and politikely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
that the politike heades may
learne therby to put good things
in practise &amp; nede nether to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the authour who was a
man of singuler wisedom &amp; great
experience, nor of the matter whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch
is an instruction of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
meete for all ages: yf God
grant me any abilitie to expresse
it. Take these first fruits of mine
infācie in good part, so &amp; you shal
encourage me to farther trauails.
My father cōmādeth me to folow
labour and to suffer others to seke
for honours. Fare you wel in
the Lorde. At London the
vii. of Iuly, the yere
of our Lord.
