   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing in this life could euer happen vnto vs more doleful or vnhappy (right honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) and worthy seruants of God, then to be forced to write to you Catholikes (our dearest bowels) any displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thing against Catholike Priestes our most intierely beloued brethrē. But for so much as the vrgent necessitie which in our former Epistle we haue declared vnto our highest Pastor &amp; in this do bewaile, &amp; lamēt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, hath driuen vs against our wils to make this answere, we thought it expedient to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne, and forearme you also in this Preface what is meant thereby, least the matter being otherwise taken then it ought should yeeld to scandal, and thereby ouerthrow you and worke your ruine, which is intended and permirted
<pb facs="13"/> by almightie God Father of all mercyes to your trial and greater merit, to which end you are diligenly to consider, that most wonderful no doubt among so many other wonders in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of al mightie God, is that his prouidence, or rather patience (as to mans eies it may appeare) whereby he permitteth; not only his whole church, familie, kingdome, and dearly bought portion to be afflicted conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with tempests, and contradictions in this life, but euery particular man also and member of most merit in the same, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of his worthines so is the measure commonly of his suffrings. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes may be shewed by infinite examples of a perpetual succession of times, and matters happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the beginning of Christian Religion, vnto our dayes.<note place="margin">Diuerse kinde of ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersaries let out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the church, and all good men.</note> For against the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Christe the author had no sooner planted it, but he opened presently all the gates of hel to set out aduersaries, and enemies to assault it, the Iewes first his owne people before, then the heathen and Pagan Emperors with all their mighte and power, and after those againe (or rather with those) he sent a new kinde of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries neuer heard of in the world before named heretikes, that took vnto them selues the name of the best sort of Christians, and yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and besides all this among such as remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Catholike Christians and vnited in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of one faith, he suffred some to be so troublesome and apt to set debate either vpon ambition, enuie, contention, anger, treason or other like passions, as they were no less
<pb facs="13"/> combersome to the Apostles and other true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, then if they had byn open enemies.</p>
   <p>Yea by this later sort especially were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good men most vexed, and galled from time to time, for of the others open persecution being knowen enemies they did not so much care, but these men being of there owne bowels, yea somtimes also suffring for the same Religion (as by diuerse epistles of S. Cyprian to them that were confessors,<note place="margin">S. Cyprian in epistolis ad Martires</note> and liued discorderly in there prisons is euident) they gaue more affliction to the parties whome they vexed; more ioy and hart to the common enemie, and more scandal and grief to all sortes of theire owne side that lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed on.</p>
   <p>Wel then (most dearly and tenderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) this was then, and this is now; and this shalbe to the worlds end the state of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Times do change, and men do pas,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note>

      <hi>Beatus qui nō fuerit scandalizatus in me.</hi> Happie is he that shal not be scandalized in me, that is, shal not leese his patience or constancie, or good opinion of the cause; for this my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of contradictions and difficulties for that this is permitted to proue you, and not to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw you.</p>

      <note place="margin">Diuers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnations of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. cause.</note>Trewly he that wil consider attentiuely, the difficulties and temptations which this our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike cause in England hath had since it was first assaulted by heresie, partely by force and flatterie, and other artes of the open enemie, &amp; thē by the peruerse dealing of some of our owne for many yeares together; but especially of late, shal easely thereby discerne the prouidence of our merciful and almightie Saueour therein, &amp; wel say that we are partakers of the same disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that others haue passed through before in like case,<note place="margin">Hebren. 8.</note> and consequently shalbe also of like good end, and happie succes through his grace, if we haue patience, and longaminitie as they had.</p>
   <p>And to say nothing in this place of the open impugnation of enemies which too wel you know, and feele dayly, what mightie difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue those had I pray you, that haue byn our chiefe guides, and leaders in sustaining this holy cause for many yeares? and this from such as should haue chiefly assisted them if this diuine prouidence had not otherwise disposed that they should rather exercise them: diuers pointes you know alreadie, and some more you are like to perceaue by this our Apologie (being driuen thereunto) but not all;<note place="margin">Reason of vvriting this Apol.</note> for auoyding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="14"/> scandal, which respect of scandal should haue with held vs wholy from putting pen to paper in this case, if the intemperance of some persons (giuen ouer as it seemeth to choler and reuenge) and forgetting both themselues and others, and the times wherein they liue; had not broken forth of late to such exces, as we are forced against our wils to put some stop or brydle to so licentious and scandalous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges least it infect euen the good, and trouble the strongest when they see such enormous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pas without controlment.</p>
   <p>And albeit we do not doubt, but that the more graue, and wiser sort wil consider of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Without our answere, the principal pointes that we can by answering note vnto them, as the extreme passion of these libellers in discending to such kinde of reuenge if they had bin iniured, the most bitter and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stile of speech against there owne,<note place="margin">Pointes to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the libels set forth.</note> nothing sauoring of that spirit that should be in seruants of one God; the nature of libelling &amp; contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious writing wherin no certaine author, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of superiours for printing is named; and wherein worthie men are defamed by name without intention or possibilitie to proue it by lawful meanes, and then what greiuous sin,<note place="margin">L.

   <p>Though we say it may be presumed that euery discret reader of himself wil ponder these poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as also what manner of men these be, that haue aduentured to be the authors of so intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
