   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here as I consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (O Chrysten readers) the daū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wrytynge in the peryllous season of these lat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter dayes, largelye depaynted by Saint Paule, euen as it pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth now in dede, that certayn persons depart from the fayth, and geue hede to desceatefull spyrytes and deuelysh doctrine through simulation of false wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des,
<pb facs="5"/>
 bi whose meanes it is come so to passe, that a lyttle faulte is not onelye taken to the worste, but what so euer is well done, spoken, or wrytten, is oftymes interpreted amysse: no marueyl though I so vnlearned greatly abashe to put my selfe in ieopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of these rauyshing wolues, &amp; pytyles soule murtherers, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che byte with theyr teeth, and preache peace with theyr ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, seynge that famous cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of pregnaunte wyttes, of excellente erudition, and singu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler vertue, haue so litle auayled in wrytynge agaynst them: not that these new teachers of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyente heresyes, &amp; late auctors of olde inueterate scysmes, are so profounde in knoweledge of Scriptures, eyther so inuycte of reasonable argumentes, that
<pb facs="5"/>
they haue not ben many tymes ouercome, as they be dayly van quyshed, but because of theyr shameles pertinacite, where as they be prostrate and lye gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelynge vpon the grounde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of reason, voyde of good argumentes, and wythoute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sence of trueth, then strogle they to woorey men with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of conuycyous maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sedicyous slaunders, not afrayd to despyce theyr so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerayns withowte regarde of theyr power, contemnynge all auctoritie, contrarye to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne of Saint Peter, saying: Be ye subiecte to euery manne for our lordes sake, vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king as cheife, and vnto the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as to those that are sent by hym for the ponyshmente of the euyll &amp; rewarde of the well

doers: for so is the wyl of God, that doyng wel ye maye stoppe the mouthes of folyshe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt people, as free and not as a colour hauynge the lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of malyce, but as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of God. Notwithstandyng in theyr solempne prefacyes, and paynted tytles of theyr er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, they begynne wyth dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet salutations, of glosinge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasyons, vnder the pretence of a godly zeale, oftymes repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge the word of God, the gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell of Chryste, hys promyses, hys charyte. &amp;c. whereby they wold perswade to rude people, that whatsoeuer theye wryte or teache, are the same thynges be they neuer so contrary, euen as the comen sorte of vngracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wretches do, whych in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng lyes &amp; reporte of slaūders,
<pb facs="6"/>
will call into theyr recorde the trouth of God, the holy enange lystes, the blessed sacramentes, and all the misteries of oure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef: not for any faythfull reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towarde them, but to the entent that they myght be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beleued in theyr falsehod.</p>
   <p>Many thynges whyche are put forth vnder the tytle of the worde of God, is not his true worde in effecte, no more thā all those whiche beare the name of Christen men, be not al chrysten men in trouth &amp; dede. Man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not onely by breade sayth scripture, but in euery worde y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> commeth oute of the mouth of god. Mark here christē reders the worde that procedeth oute of the mouth of God, to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> which we oughte nother to adde, nor to take any thynge awaye from
<pb facs="7"/>
it. Arrius, Pelagius, Maniche us, wyth suche other, whome the moore parte of these sectes confesse to be heretykes, dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently layde the worde of God for theym, but not owte of hys mouth: for they applyed it by wronge interpretations to the settyng for the of theyr heresy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and not to the glory of God. Saynt Pauie heled syck folke, and draue the wycked spyryts from them that were possessed through goddes worde in the name of Jesu, whose doyng the chyldren of Sceue assayde to counterfete with lyke wordes: to whom the spyrit aunswered: I knowe Jesu and Paule, but what are ye? and so greuously assawtynge them, he preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led agaynst theyr presumpsion. The aged Prophet of Bethell,
<pb facs="7"/>
by whose desceate the manne of God sent out of Juda to Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boham was slayne: alleged the worde of God. The false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Sedechias with his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany .iiii. C. in nomber, falselye promysed kynge Achab vycto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to his destruction, layenge for theyr auctorytye the worde of God. Ananias resysted the true Prophete Jeremye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyenge to the captyne Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helytes lybertie and sone dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce of theyr bondage, cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>synge them to truste in his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge, whiche he sayde was the worde of God. And generallye all other false Prophetes bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them selues to be sente of God, &amp; came to prech his truth, whome he neuer dyd sende, as he wytnessethe with his owne mouthe in diuers places of the
<pb facs="8"/>
byble. Furthermore all suche as occupye inchauntmentes, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers, &amp; wytches, in theyr bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes wyth manye ceremonies rehearse the word of God. Also our sauyour Christe sayth that manye shall come in his name, saying: I am Chryste, and they shall desceaue many, but howe? surely in perswading that their doctryne is Goddes word, and that they be hys messengers, hys annoynted sonnes and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyall prophetes, So dyd Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus delude the people of Samary, affermyng that he was Christe. Lykewyse Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomette named hym selfe the great prophete of God. And all other heretykes commenlye in fortefyenge theyr abhomyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heresyes, alledge the worde of God and euangelike veryte,
<pb facs="8"/>
accordyng as Martyn Luther with the whole rable of hys ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents do dayly practyse. But what auayleth it to resyte the worde of God, yf we interprete it by a false peruerted sence?</p>
   <p>What auauntage is it to saye Lord Lorde, and do not as he cōmaūdeth vs? He that saith I know God, and obseruethe not hys commaundementes, is a lyer, and there is no truthe in hym. The Pharyseys Dyscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sayd to Christe: Mayster, we knowe that thou art a true speaker, &amp; thou teachest y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> waye of God in truthe, yet thoughte they nothynge so in theyr har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. What thynge is more easy for these new teachers, than in blasynge theyr auctorytye, to saye that theyr doctryne is the trewe worde of God, and that
<pb facs="9"/>
they haue hys spyryte: where as they admyt no interpretaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of scripture but theyr owne, in so muche that they reiecte parte of the bible because it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to theyr purpose.</p>
   <p>Concerninge the determinatiō of generall councelles, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorytye of auncyent doctours of the churche, they vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temne, excepte in fewe thynges whereoute they gather senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whyche falselye depraued and otherwhile chaunged clene contrarye to the auctoures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they make to serue in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourynge theyr heresye. Howe shall wee then knowe whether they be the ryghte preachers, &amp; theyr doctryn the word of god or noo? Trewlye Chryste ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs a rule infallyble, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge: By theyr fruytes ye shall
<pb facs="9"/>
knowe theym. A good tree can brynge forthe no euyll fruyte, nor a badde tree canne brynge forthe no good frute. And they whiche here the worde of God with an earnest and good hart, they holde it faste, bryngynge forth fruyte in patience. Also Saint James descrybyng the expedient condition of christen prechers, and heuenly learning sayth: who that among you is wyse endued with connynge, lette hym shewe hys good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes out of a good conuersation wyth softenes of wysedome. If ye haue sower hatred and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryaunce amonge you in youre harte, wyll not ye reioyce, and be lyars agaynst the truth? for thys is not the wysdome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge from aboue, but earthly, bestial and deuelysh. Where as
<pb facs="10"/>
is enmyte &amp; contention, there is inconstancy and all noughty doyng. The wisdom that descē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth from God is fyrste chaste, and so peaseable, mylde, treata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, full of mercy, and good fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, wythout any mysdemynge or dyssymulatyon. Nowe to compare these fruites vnto the actes of these Lutheran facty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ye shall fynde a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Wherefore seyng that by longe experyence I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the fashion, manner, and order of all states among them, and was no small whyle conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saunt wyth those whiche are of hyest reputation, both for theyr sobernes of lyfe, and fame of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature: I haue thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the dyscharge of my conscience, and information of other, playnlye to shewe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie
<pb facs="10"/>
as I haue knowen, wyth out hatred of them or fauoure of any other persons: which to performe I haue here compiled thys lytle processe folowynge, vnder the forme of a breife dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge. Wherein though ye shall rede some thynges so straunge for the enormities of them, that diuers men, namelye the fauou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers of these sectes, wyll iudge them vnlykelye of trueth, and halfe impossyble to be vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong resonable people endued wyth any wysdom or learning: yet are they matter in dede, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge as ye shall see vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlye declared. And be ye full assured that I reherse not by a greate parte all the abuses ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfestlye knowen by thē, nor so many as I could shew: whiche god wyllyng hereafter in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="11"/>
of tyme maye be dysclosed more largelye. A greate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion why that many be so feruēt in fauorynge this Lutherane doctryne, is the vayne prayses of much people commyng from thence, reportyng that there is so good order, suche charitable liberalitie, and euangelyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, whiche is all to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther false. And dyuers of suche tydyng cariers, lest they might seme ignoraunte in a fewe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they frame theym selues wythoute shame, to lye in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. It is harde for a renagate frere, a faythelesse apostata, a forlorne coopeman, a marchaun tes prētyce, or an embassatours hostler, hauynge lytle learning, lesse dyscresyon, small deuocy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and scant a curtesy of wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: to make true reporte in
<pb facs="11"/>
such matters. And yet are ther of them which make thē selues full busy, and are as redy to tell that they knowe not as y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> that they know, accordynge as they feale theyr affeccions desposed whome they couet to please: by whiche meanes they attayne hye cōmendations, made much of, &amp; ar called prety wyse men &amp; proper persōs, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> many goodes blessynges vpon theyr hartes. Suche is the maddenes of the worlde and folysh appetytes of people, preferring their corrupt affections before ryghte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and testymonye of theyr conscyence. Truthe it is that the Germayns of old antiquite haue deserued specyall lawde for theyr playnes in worde and dede voyd of dissimulation, and for theyr homelye famylyaryte
<pb facs="12"/>
wythout acception of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rsons, in whiche vnto this daye, they excel other nacions: wherof the originall cause manye falslye do ascrybe to thys Lutheran doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, beynge doubtlesse meru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> lousely decayd throughe it, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> true playnesse was not wonte to be so scace there among scant good liuers, as fraudes begyn now to be plenty among theyr newe Gospellers. Wherefore (Christen reders) I exhort you all percialite set a parte, to fyxe youre selfe vppon the lyuynge worde of God whiche may saue your soules, and walke dyrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye after it, bowynge nether on the one syde nor on the other. I meane not that fleshly worde nor theyr Gospell whiche saye: ye haue no fre wyll, youre good deedes shall not saue you, nor
<pb facs="12"/>
your yldedes shall not dampne you, the sacramētes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church be nothing of necessite, ye nede not to be confessed to a preeste, ye are not bownde to obey the lawes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church. &amp;c. but that true worde of god &amp; verye gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of our Sauyour Christe, of whose fyrste sermon the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theme was thys: Doo ye pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kyngdome of God is at hande. And at hys laste farewell from his Disciples he affyrmed the same, saying that in his name it behoued penaūce to be preached in remyssyon of synnes: whiche maner of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the aposties after his as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sention obserued, contynuallye exhortynge the people vnto pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naūce, and to the drede of God, whiche is the begynnynge of wysedome, the inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panion <pb facs="13"/>
of penaunce, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty introduction to fayth. The worde of God bryngeth for the penance, accordyng as we rede in the actes of the apostles .iii. y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> at saynt Peters preaching thei were compuncte in hearte, and offred them selfe to pennaunce. This vnfayned pennaunce lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men to faythe, and is the entre to the gospel, Mar. i. Do ye pennaunce sayth Christ, and beleue the gospell. Which beleif can not be attayned wythoute the dreade of God. For it is the fulnes of scyence, whereby we come downe first to know oure self, &amp; so ascende to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowlege of God by his word, whereoute through hearynge fayth taketh her effect. The maiestie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worde is of that nature, to prostrate the presumpcyon of
<pb facs="13"/>
mannes wysedome &amp; affyaunce in our selues, exylyng thaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of carnall liberte, &amp; mouing vs wyth a readynes of minde &amp; certayne trimbling feare to say with saynt Paule, Lorde what wyllest thou vs to doo? Thys reuerent drede had Cornelius Centurio, whan the ioyful mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of God appeared vnto hym, to whō with feare abashed he sayd: Lorde who art thou? in whose commendation it is written there. Actes .x. that he was a deuout man and dreding god. Likewise. Luk. iij. y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> shepe herdes, whan y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> aungell of glad tidinges appeared to them, and y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> brightues of God shone roūd about thē: hauyng thys drede, were astonnyed in them selues, to whom the aungell spake: Be not afrayd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o I shew you great

ioye that shall be to all people, for there is borne a Sauyoure which is Christe oure lorde. In Exodo it is wrytten .xiiii. y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple feared God, and so beleued hym &amp; hys seruaunt Moyses. And they that drede god, sayth the wysemanne, shall not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull to hys worde. Alsoo Saynt John rehearseth in his Apocalypse sayinge: I sawe an aungell flyenge by the myddes of heuen, hauing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> euerlastinge Gospell, that he shoulde preach to the dwellers vppon yearthe, &amp; to euery nacion, &amp; trybe, and tonge, and people, saying wyth a greate voyce: Feare ye God But now cometh the aungell of Sathan wyth his ydle iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and vayne promyses, cleane contrarye perswading y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we nede no workes of penaūce
<pb facs="14"/>
nor satysfaction for our synnes. lyth Chryste hath satysfyed for vs all ready, onely to beleue is ynoughe, wythdrawynge peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the godly drede. How be it leaste his disceate shulde be easelye perceaued: he transfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gureth hym selfe into a trewe angelles lykenes, sometime tea chynge vertuouse maners, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlye charyty, the example of Christes actes &amp; oure nedefull accomplyshment of thē, wherin he wolde seme to profyte a few, to the intente he myght begyle many. And dyuers of hys Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples counterfeytyng the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles fashyon: other whyles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge scryptures in theyr right sences, with the same deuoute synceryte that Sathanne hym selfe dyd in temptynge Chryste when he sayd to him: God hath
<pb facs="15"/>
commaunded his aungelles. &amp;c whiche was the very scrypture truelye recyted, all though to a wronge purpose. But where as he in his owne person coulde not ouercome Christ our head: he ceasseth not to supplante vs hys Christen members by hys false Disciples, and is lyke styll to preuayle (oure merytes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wrath of god) excepte he of hys infinyte goodnes and gracyous pytie, vouchesafe to reconcyle vs agayne vnto hys fauour, and be oure protectour: whose mercy is the onely staye that we be not all consumed.</p>
   <p>Therefore lette vs drawe nere with confydence to the throne of grace, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> we may gette mercy and fynde grace to helpe vs at nede, contynuallye hauynge in oure remembraunce the voyce
