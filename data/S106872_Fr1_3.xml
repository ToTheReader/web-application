   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian Reader, whereas the author of these reasons vpon his good conceit of the forciblenesse of them to perswade to Popery, hath thought them worthy of a second impression, and a new augmentation: I am partly thereby, and partly by the request of the Printer and others, moued to publish againe in Print my answer to them. The which I haue recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in many places enlarged, by adding not onely moe testimonies, but also some discourses. I haue also in the end adioyned answers to some friuolous cauillations which <hi>S. R.</hi> in his answer to Maister <hi>Bels downe-fall of Poperie,</hi> and others haue made against it. And hereof I must certifie thee good Reader, that I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into the said reasons the Authors new additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which that thou maist discerne from the other, <q>I haue put this marke vnto them: the same marke also I haue put to my answers made to the same.</q> I haue also in this impression added an answer to certaine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish questions written fifteene or sixteene yeares past, the which although it was long agoe allowed to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, yet it hath vntill now lien by me: howbeit now for the reasons in the Preface before it declared, I haue thought good to ioyne it vnto this.</p>
   <p>Now although this my answer will bring no profit to them, that being wedded to will, and bewitched by a
<pb facs="6"/> strong delusion, will not vouchsafe to looke vpon it, much lesse will wholy read, compare, and examine it, but will condemne it, before they know it: yet if it may serue to the defence of Gods truth, and to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of thee good Reader in the same: as I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obtaine that I doe seeke, so my desire is, that thou wilt remember mee at the throne of grace in thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers. The Father of all mercy giue vs true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all things, and guide vs by the light of his holy word outwardly, and by his blessed spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to beleeue his truth, and obey his will to his owne glory, and our eternall comfort. Amen. Aprill 22. 1608.</p>
