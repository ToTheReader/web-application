   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing of great wonder, to behold how God preserueth his Church from drowning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in these greeuous times. The Deuill is so full of wrath, knowing his time is but short, Reuel. 12. v. 12. that he raiseth vp such tempests &amp; whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>le windes, with such lightning and thunders, with such outragious surges and waues, as if heauen and earth should bee mixed together. His cheefe Vassals, the tyrants and Heretikes, doo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bestirre them, to effect his curssed desires. By the one sort hee dooth breath out terror, and as it were spit fire. By the other he spueth vp deadlye poison, and casteth his poisoned dartes. He is so subtill, that he transformeth himselfe into the likenesse of an Angell of light, and his Ministers come in faire cloakes▪ For behold all sortes of Heretikes and Schismatikes, and yee shall see fewe of them come in the Deuils liuerie. The Papists shrowde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder the name and title of the Catholike Church. These cry out, the fathers, the fathers, the auncient Fathers. These proclaime vs and all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which haue forsaken their fellowship, and imbraced the Gospell, to be Schismatikes and Heretiks. These affirme, that we haue no word of God, no Sacraments, nor Ministrie, because we be cut off from them. These preuaile mightelie among the blind superstitious people, who greedely drinke vp all the poison &amp; abhominations, which the Deuill hath spued vp into that faire golden cuppe in which they offer them, Reuel. 17. which is, that they be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes. There is risen vp among vs a blinde sect, opposite to these, which is so furious, that it commeth like a raging tempest from a contrary coast, so that our ship is tossed betweene contrary waues. For these cry alowd, that our assemblies be Romish, idolatrous; antichristian Synagogs. That we worship the beast, receiue his marke, and stand vnder his yoake. And finally, that we haue no Ministery, no word of God nor Sacraments. These pretend such fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of zeale against all false worship, superstition, and Idolatrie, and such loue to the discipline of Christ, and crie so lowd, that a man would thinke he heard the voice of <hi>Elias,</hi> of <hi>Haggeus,</hi> and of that third Angel, Reu. 14. Downe with the Preests of <hi>Baal,</hi> come out from among them, worship not the beast, arise, arise, &amp; build the Temple and altar of the Lord. With this counterfet voice the Deuill seduceth many, and troubleth all such as are weake, and yet haue zeale against false worship, trembling for feare of pollution: with this sect onely haue I now to deale. First therfore touching their name, we terme them <hi>Brownists,</hi> as being the Disciples &amp; Scholers of <hi>Browne.</hi> There be indeed new masters sprong vp, which seeke to carrie awaye the name, and I haue heard diuers say, they go beyond <hi>Browne.</hi> But whosoeuer shal reade his books
<pb facs="4"/>
and peruse all their writings, shall well see, that he deserueth to haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if any be, and to be called the Captaine and maister of them all. They haue all their furniture from him: they do but open his packe, and displaye his wares. They haue not a sharpe arrowe, which is not drawne out of his quiuer.</p>
   <p>Then next, touching the question betweene them and me, let the reader consider, it is not about the controuersie in our Church, as whether there be imperfections, corruptions, and faults, in our worship, ministerie, and church gouernment, nor how many, great or small. But whether there be such hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous enormities, as destroy the verye life and being of a true Church, and make an vtter diuorse from Christ. I will lay it open more plaine by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison which the Scripture vseth. The Church is like a man, in whom there be many parts and members. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. If all the parts or members of the body haue their iust proportion, be whole and sound, and set in their due order, the soule and life departed, he is no longer a man, to speake properly, but the dead carcasse of a man. But now if he be sicke and diseased, so that all partes are feeble, or if he be deformed with sores and maimes, wanting hand, foote, eye, nose, or such like, yet is he still a man, so long as the soule and life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in him. All men doo know this to be true, yea euen the simplest make no doubt or controuersie about it. Let vs see therefore whether it be a fitte comparison with the Church, and whether it be so in it of necessitie, and as manifest by the doctrine of the holy scriptures, as this other is vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily senses.</p>
   <p>To finde this, we must first consider, whether there be no true Church of GOD, but that which is perfect in this worlde? Wee knowe that there are none but Heretikes, yea ranke abhominable heretikes, which obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny this cleere doctrine of the holy Scriptures, namely, that euen the most faithfull, and the most godly, are not perfect while they liue vpon the earth. We know but in part. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. In many things we sinne all. <hi>Iam. 3. v.</hi> 2. And who vnderstandeth his errors, or who can tell how oft he offendeth? <hi>Psal</hi> 19. The perfectest members of the Church doo erre, doo sinne, are mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are weake, are spotted and deformed many wayes. Nowe, whereas all the members be in this case, needes must the whole body which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of them be in the same estate. Then we may not looke for a Church in this world, which is not spotted, deformed, maymed, and weake, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
   <p>But the question must bee, how farre it may bee deformed and maimed, and yet remaine aliue, and so a true Church of God. Let all the partes bee ioyned together: let there be all sortes of officers and offices, yet if the life, and as it were the soule of the Church be wanting, it is but a dead carcasse. Contrarywise, let there be some members wanting, some maimed, all parts deformed and weake, yet is it a true Church of God, so long as the soule and life dooth remaine in it. And what is the soule and life of the Church? Iesus Christ apprehended by faith. I liue now, saith Saint Paul, but not any longer I, but Christ liueth in me, <hi>Galath. 2. ver.</hi> 20. All the members of the
<pb facs="4"/>
Church are incorporate, and graffed into Christ by faith, and doo growe in him, and through the operation of his spirite receiue the iuice and sappe of life from him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. Whosoeuer beleeueth in the Sonne of God, shall be saued, though he be full of errors, full of infirmities, and deformities, both in body and soule, labouring to be purged.</p>
   <p>But if a man, or an assembly do hold that which ouerthroweth the faith in Christ, they are gone, there is no life remaining. As the Papacie holdeth many things aright touching Christ; but it holdeth sundry things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ouerthrow the very foundation of the faith, and so the Papacie it selfe is not Gods true Church.</p>
   <p>Thus haue I laide open the question, betweene mee and the <hi>Brownists:</hi> wherein then are the Maisters and Capitaines of <hi>Brownisme</hi> deceiued? And what is it, in which they seeke victorie and glory? They knowe there is no sinne, no error, no corruption, nor no abuse, but that if all the learnedest in the worlde would take vpon them to cleere and to defend the same, they shall not be able. Then they are desirous of victorie, of triumphe and glorye▪ ouer all both wise and learned. Heere therefore they entrench themselues, they make their Bulwarkes, plant their ordinance, set themselues in arraye, and sound the Trumpet of defiance against all. They presume, none shall euer be able to driue them out of their holde. And indeed, he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an error, and goeth no further, can neuer be vanquished. But heerein they are deceiued, that out of this Forte they will batter downe the Church. For theyr ordinance is ouer weake for that: they stoppe in powder in great plenty, for they laye on toong enough, and so make terrible thundering crakes. But the Bullets which come foorth, and which should doo the deed, are nothing but hereticall, erronious, and fantasticall opinions, and so all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth into smoake. They must therefore at the last, leaue their holde, and take them to their heeles, for Gods Church will not be battered downe by any assaults of Schismatikes.</p>
   <p>Some will thinke hardly, that I terme them Schismatikes, seeing they be men that are accounted zealous▪ and stand for good things. But the truth is, they be not onely a Schisme, yea a vile Schisme, rending themselues from the Church of England, and condemning by their assertions, the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church in the worlde, euen as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did of olde time: but also they maintaine heresies, and some that touche the very foundation of faith and Christian religion: they be vtter violaters of ecclesiasticall discipline, they abridge the power of the ciuill Magistrate, beside sundry fantasticall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. For when as the life of the church consisteth in the apprehensson of Christ through faith, it must needs be an heresie, to conclude as they doo, a <hi>nullitie,</hi> &amp; a quite ouerthrow of the same, from errors &amp; faults which are not fundamentall. Faith and regeneration being vnperfect, in all that liue vpon the earth, it is heriticall, to say, that is no Church of God, which holding the sounde doctrine, hath sinnes and great abuses in it.</p>
   <p>The stablenesse of Gods couenant towarde the Church, being founded onely vpon his free grace, it is detestable impietie, to hang it vpon the works
<pb facs="5"/>
of men, as the <hi>Brownists</hi> do, when they affyrme, that where there is any open sinnes suffered in an assemblie, the couenant is disanulled with them all. And if men consider well, they shall finde that the whole <hi>Brownisme</hi> resteth vppon the heresie of perfection and Anabaptisticall freedome. For from hence, that it is written, <hi>Ierusalem from aboue is the mother of vs all, and is free with her children.</hi> They boast of such freedome, as that touching outwarde orders, the Prince and Church hath no power to impose any thing by Lawes and Constitutions. Which is one thing wherein they do not onely abridge the power of the Christian Magistrates, denying them the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to reforme the Church, and to compell their subiects to the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, spoyling the Church of that comfortable ayd: but also condemne all reformed Churches which haue orders and prescript formes of prayers imposed, which these <hi>Brownists</hi> tearme Idolatrie, a tradition bringing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian libertie into bondage, and therefore a thing most detestable. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they hold such a perfect freedome from all spirituall bondage of sinne, that they affyrme <hi>S. Paule</hi> neuer consented to wicked thoughts after he was regenerate. But in an other place they affyrme, that all men be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and can keepe no one Commaundement: where they are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to themselues, vttering that which ouerthroweth the whole <hi>Brownisme▪</hi> and also speake grosely. For albeit there is no man perfect in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, yet the holy Scriptures do not call them Idolaters nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. They boldly gayne say the holy Ghost, by affirming that the Psalmes were not to be sung vnto God. And touching the discipline, which is the thing they most glorie of, as if they suffered for it: let all men know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, that they be not only ignorant what it is, but also do in their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise breake and ouerthrow the very pith and substance thereof in the chiefe rules. For they take vpon them to abandon and cast foorth whole assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes which professe the Gospell, and haue their estimation and dignitie among all godly Churches, without obseruing the rule giuen by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. They intrude themselues without calling, beeing meere priuate men, to the erecting and establishing of a publike gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forgetting that which is written, <hi>I haue not sent them, and yet they runne.</hi> They cut off also the power of the Church in a great part of the discipline, as namely, in ordeyning constitutions in things that are variable. Finally touching this poynt, I may say boldly, the Diuell can no way almost more disgrace Ecclesiasticall gouernment then he doth by them, for it is the Sterne of Christes Ship, and requireth men of the greatest wisedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, experience, and sobrietie that may be, for to guide it. Now when the common Artificer, the Apprentise and the Bruer intrude themselues, and they will guide the same, being ignorant, rash, and headie, what worldlie wise man will not take it, that discipline her selfe is but a bedlem? Who will aduenture himselfe in that Ship, where presumptuous ignorance, and bold frensie doth sit at the Helme? Shall that Ship escape the rockes? If it would please God to giue <hi>Browne</hi> the grace to repent, and to speake the truth, he could best declare this thing. For when he had with certayne other, drawne
<pb facs="5"/>
some both men and women ouer the Seas, and there spread his Sayles, how soone did his silly Boate dash vppon the rocke, and was clouen in two or three peeces? Let not men be deceyued with euery vayne shewe, for vndoubtedly, he that obserueth shall finde, that the end of <hi>Brownisme,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Schismes, Heresies, Atheisme, and Barbarisme. For what other fruites can followe of the disgracing and condemning the liberall Artes, of bringing the ministerie of Gods Word, by which the religion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines that is in men, hath been <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rought into vtter contempt? What can followe from immoderate outragious rash furie, wrath, and bitter zeale, and vainglorious contention, which are earthly, sensuall, and diuelish? If men could stay themselues but a while, and see whether the same things spring not foorth, which came from the <hi>Donatists</hi> and Anabaptists, it were well. For it is to be wondred at, that any which professe the Gospell, should be seduced and called away not only from the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that haue taught them, but from all the most worthy men and Churches vnder heauen, and that by the voyce of the Deuill in such furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blinde Schismatikes. In deede there be two speciall causes of it: the one, that sundry men receyue not the holy Word of God in humilitie, with feare and trembling, with conscience to practise, but are puffed vp, and swell with opinion of their knowledge, as soone as they can vtter a fewe words: and growe vnto vayne iangling, yea, vnto bitter zeale, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in stead of being quiet (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> willeth) and medling with their own busines, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. and also in stead of following after righteousnes, faith and loue, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.</p>
   <p>He that seemeth most zealous in religion, and refraineth not his toong, hath but bitternesse in steed of heauenly zeale. For wheras, in steed of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse, meekenesse, patience, mercie, and loue, yee finde wrath, fiercenesse, intemperat rage, vncharitable condemning and slaundering, know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that the true zeale is not there. The other cause of mens seducing, is that in this corrupt age there be many stumbling blockes, and greeuous offences: where indeed, it is the part and duty of euery true Christian man, beside the taking heede to his owne wayes, most instantly to offer vp praiers and supplications to God, to intreate him to shew mercie and compassion vpon vs, by increasing all heauenly graces and giftes of his holy spirit in our most noble Queene, and in all Gouernours, both ciuill and ecclesiasticall, that there may be feruent zeale to purge the house of God, and to take away the causes of contention, that we may not alwaies seeke to deuoure one an other, but that vnity and concord may florish, holding this withall, that it is also euery mans dutie that will feare God, to giue him hearty thanks for the inestimable treasures and blessings which he hath bestowed vpon vs, by meanes of the happy raigne of our gratious Soueraigne: and to take heed of that malignant spirite of Brownisme, which would carry vs to this wicked opinion, that she bearing the Sworde of God, hath doone no more for vs then an Heathen Prince might doo. For if we haue no word of God, no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, no Sacraments nor visible Church, but all idolatrous and antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb facs="6"/>
what hath she done, what honor can she haue for defence of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? This is no small dishonour and iniurie to a Christian Prince, thus to diminish the loue of the subiects. The Lord giue them repentance, and grace, to cease from such impietie; and let all men with modestie, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and subiection, and not with reproch and contempt, seeke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse of abuses at their hands which be in Authoritie: and not aduenture like <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> to intrude themselues without calling and warrant from God. They cryed out, are not all the Lords people holy? and therefore <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> yee take too much vppon yee. The <hi>Brownist</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymeth, that all the Lords people are free, and therefore freely to deale, and not to haue any thing imposed by any. Be not deceyued, but knowe for certaintie, that they be full and rancke <hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in part. I knowe it is complayned of, that there be so many and so diuers Sectes and Heresies dayly springing vp where the Gospell is preached, for it seemeth a foule disgrace both to the Gospell it selfe, and to the Preachers. There are, say some, at the least fifty seuerall sectes. Behold, say others, how the people are lead without ground, and haue no stay but are caryed without ende from one thing to another. What is the cause? is not the preaching? is there any thing deliuered which is certayne? are not the fruites of theyr Sermons, factions, and Schismes? These speeches do so abash and trouble some, that they are driuen backe, and retyre into flat Poperie, as into a safe hauen, which yet in truth is the gulfe of all Schismes and abhominable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies Others are so much displeased, that they become Atheists, and care not much for any Religion, though of both they doo rather fauour the Poperie. A third sort there be which did runne, and now stand still and wonder: they knowe not whether they were best to goe backe or forward. Their loue and zeale is decayed, and readie vtterly to be quenched. It is wonderfull that there should be such blindnes in men, and want of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to consider rightly of all causes and effects. The Scriptures are cleere that light is come into the world, and men loue darknesse more then light, because their works be euill. And what followeth heerevpon, because they receyue not the loue of the truth, that they might be saued: God doth send them strong delusion to beleeue lyes, that they may be damned, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. It is the heauie iudgement of God vppon the wicked world, that Satan is let loose to seduce and leade into error. Men are worthie of such a plague, and it doth come vppon them to the full: for they be not able now to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the truth, but do reproch and blaspheme it, seeking the disgrace of such as do bring it. Moreouer, the Scriptures do shewe, that God hath an other purpose in sending strong delusion, and the efficacie of error, and that is touching his elect, for they be clogged with the fleshe, slowe and dull to search out the truth: they be readie to leane to their owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and seeke not vnto God. When Schismes and Heresies arise, it doth awaken them, causeth them to search more diligently, yea, to seeke vnto God, and to depend wholly vppon him for light and instruction. It causeth them to feare and tremble in humilitie, and to make precious account of
<pb facs="6"/>
the truth when they haue once found it: seeing the Deuill laboureth so mightely to depriue them of it by quenching the light. I heare (sayth <hi>S. Paule</hi>) that there be Schismes among ye, and I do in part beleeue it: for there must be Heresies, that such as are approued, may be made manifest, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. When we see it come to passe, that through the malice and craft of the Deuill and his instruments such confusion doth ouerspread all, let vs not loue the Gospell the worse, let vs not blaspheme it, but knowe it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs vpon to be more carefull. The blessed Apostles themselues had to encounter with Heretikes and false Apostles, and full cunningly did Satan winde in himselfe in their dayes. When they were taken away, what troups of Heretikes did he send foorth? what blasphemies and detestable furies did he vtter and spread by them? how were all the auncient Doctors and holy Fathers in the Churches set on worke to confute them, and to defend the true Christian people from infection? Why then should we nowe be daunted? or why should it be any reproch to the holy Doctrine now more then of old, that the Diuell, where any light is shewed, doth followe it by and by at the heeles, to worke disgrace? Let the ministers of Gods Word looke diligently to theyr flockes, and teach them the wholesome pure Doctrine, and the way of Sanctification. Let true zeale spring afresh, which nowe suffreth great contempt, because there is a mad bedlem risen vp, which nameth her selfe by her name. There be diuers which cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst zeale very naughtely, when it is most certayne no man can haue ouermuch godly zeale, especially in these dayes, wherein, who almost hath any hote loue for the glorie of God, and the saluation of his people? If Christ should speake, what other sentence can we looke for, but that which he vttered of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Reuel.</hi> 3. Thou art neyther hote nor cold. But let vs come to the matter in hand.</p>
