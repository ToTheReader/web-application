   <head>THE PREFACE to the WORKE. <hi>OR,</hi> An ocular SERMON, fitting the Subiect, being an exposition vpon PSAL. 119. 3.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a most regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable saying, and worthy all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> recordeth in the Psalm, speaking of all those who are blessed, both here, and for
<pb n="2" facs="11"/> euer hereafter. <hi>They doe no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, they walke in Gods waies. Psal.</hi> 119. 3. In which place, are set downe two infallible notes of all Gods children, putting a maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked impes of Sathan. First, <hi>Gods Children doe no iniquity.</hi> Which words must not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and properly bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; for all men haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and doe sinne, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after conuersion. <hi>If I Iohn, and my fellow Apostles say we haue not sinned, we make God a lyar, 1 Ioh. 1. 10. For all haue sinned, Rom.</hi> 3. 23. Againe, after conuersion, <hi>If we say wee haue no sinne, wee deceiue our selues, and the truth is not in vs. 1 Iohn 1. 8. For all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse are as filthy ragges, Esay. 64. 6. For there is not a iust man vpon earth that doth good, and sinneth not, Eccles.</hi> 7. 20. It is not so meant then, that Gods
<pb n="3" facs="11"/> children neuer sinne; neither, as the Papists hold, that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne is so abolished by Baptisme, that, in the partie baptized, there remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which God may hate; But the meaning of the words is this: <hi>They doe no iniquity;</hi> that is, they commit not sinne so, as to liue in a customarie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of any one sinne; though they may faile in words, and doe amisse in deedes, yet the tenour and course of their liues shall be according to Gods commandements. They lye not in their sinnes; sinne raignes not in them; they giue not themselues ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sinne, to become slaues and seruants vnto sinne; They sinne not against conscience, and knowledge, of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; they sinne not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilfully and wittingly, with full consent and swinge of will: Neither can they so sin,
<pb n="4" facs="12"/> for being regenerated, the Spirit of God keeps them from so sinning: Thus are the like places to be vnderstood. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer abideth in Christ, sinneth not, 1 Ioh. 3. 6. Whosoeuer is borne of God, doth not commit sinne, for his seede remaineth in him, and he cannot sinne because he is borne of God, verse</hi> 9. This is a speciall marke to discerne the childe of God, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; for the wicked sinneth wilfully, customarily, lying, and trading in his sinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sound repentance, or true remorse of conscience, sporting and delighting in sinne; <hi>going on in sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, Psal. 68. hating to be reformed, Psal. 50. he giueth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe to siane, to obey it in the lusts thereof, Rom.</hi> 6. In a word, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked being past feeling, giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ouer to lasciuiousnesse, to</hi>
      <pb n="5" facs="12"/>
      <hi>worke all vncleanenesse with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, Ephes. 4. 19. and not onely commit wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deedes, but commit them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily, in an vngodly manner, as Iude, Epist. Verse</hi> 15. that is, they doe their workes from an vnrepentant heart, and with a minde deuoted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to vngodlinesse; with a purpose to sinne afore-hand; taking pleasure in sinne; and running on in the same course without repentance. Herein stands the sound triall of a mans selfe indeede, whether he be in the state of grace or not; namely, if hee can say truely in the testimony of a good conscience, he doth no iniquity, so, as I haue shewed; First, he purposeth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, but it is both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side and against his purpose. Secondly, he hath a resisting and strife against it, and is not wholly swallowed vp in the
<pb n="6" facs="13"/> pleasure of it. Thirdly, if hee doth fall, through weakenesse and his owne corruption, yet he lieth not in it, but recouers himselfe againe by renewed repentance. And this is the first marke of <hi>Dauids</hi> blessed man in the Text; and worthily are they set in the first place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a maine preparatiue to this walke; for first a man must cease to doe euill, and then doe good; first, cease to doe iniquitie, then to walke in Gods waies.</p>
   <p>Secondly, <hi>the godly walke in Gods waies.</hi> First, obserue their action; <hi>they walke,</hi> that is, they frame and leade their liues according to those waies which God in his holy word hath appointed to walke in. Secondly, wherin they walke, and their discretion; not in their owne waies, following the imaginations of their own hearts; not in the waies of
<pb n="7" facs="13"/> sinne the world, the flesh, nor Diuell; but denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and resigning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wholly to Gods will and pleasure in all things, <hi>they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abhorre all false wayes, Psal. 119. 104. 128. they walke,</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>in his waies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, marke the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their walke; not in some few; here and there do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some good thing in a good moode, or by fits and snatches, but yeelding a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obedience to all Gods Commandements, as <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth; They walke in all his waies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly, obserue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who onely doe and can walke in this way; <hi>they;</hi> that is, onely the godly, who are indued with sauing-grace, and haue ceased to commit iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they walke in his waies; they stand not still in this way, nor goe backward, nor onely
<pb n="8" facs="14"/> begin well, and make some good proceedings, and then stand at a stay, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in good duties, grow in grace, going forward in the knowledge of Christ; they goe on till they come to their iournyes end. <hi>They walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>;</hi> thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> is their progression: Second<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> they keepe themselues onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> in Gods waies, auoiding a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> by-paths; this is their discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thirdly; in all Gods waies; there is their extension: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they, and onely they; this is their condition. This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the godly and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>The godly walke in the law of the Lord, Psal. 119. 1. Hee that is a iust and righteous man indeed, walketh in Gods statutes, Ezech.</hi> 18. 9. and as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith here, <hi>they walke in Gods waies.</hi> But the wicked, not so. <hi>For they walke not in Gods law, nor in his statutes, nor in his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,</hi>
      <pb n="9" facs="14"/>
      <hi>Ier. 44 23. They set themselues in no good way, Psal. 36. 4. The way of peace, they haue not knowne, Rom. 3. 17. They doe alwaies erre in their hearts, because they haue not knowne Gods waies, Heb. 3. 10. They walke in the vanity of their minde, Ephes. 4. 17. They walke after their owne vngodly lusts,</hi> as <hi>Iude, Epist. Verse 16. 18. Yea, they walke, but they are enemies to the Crosse of Christ, whose end is destruction, Phil. 3. 18. They walke in the counsell of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. Psal. 1. 1. The godly walke as children of the light, Ephes. 5. 8. But the way of the wicked, is as the darkenesse, they know not at what they stumble, Prou. 4. 19. The wicked walke on in darkenesse, Psal.</hi> 82. 4. All which must teach euery one to auoid the path of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the godly, to hate euery false way, and to keepe our
<pb n="10" facs="15"/> selues onely in Gods waies. Thus may wee expect the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious protection and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God and his holy Angels, <hi>If we keepe our selues in those waies he hath appointed for vs, Psal. 91. 11. Be not therefore companions with the wicked, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 5. 7. Walke not thou in the way with them, refrayne thy foote from their path, Prouerb. 1. 15. For, for such wicked courses comes the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience, Ephes. 5. 6. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and goe not into the way of eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ll men; auoid it, passe not by it, turne from it, and passe away, Prou. 4. 14. 15. They leaue the pathes of vprightnesse, to walke in the wayes of darkenesse; They reioyce to doe euill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the frowardnesse of the wicked, whose waies are crooked, and they froward in their pathes, Prou. 2. 13. 14. 15. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discretion preserue thee, and</hi>
      <pb n="11" facs="15"/>
      <hi>vnderstanding keepe thee, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee from the may of the euill man, that thou maist walke in the way of good men, and keepe the paths of the righteous, Prou. 2. 10. 11. to 20. Then shalt thou walke in thy way safely, Prou. 3. 23. For the righteous walke in Gods waies,</hi> as the Text saith, <hi>They walke in his waies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>More particularly, obserue out of this clause: first, what is meant by <hi>walke,</hi> and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of it: secondly, what are these waies of God, and why so called.</p>
   <p>This dutie of walking is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a good sence, or bad; In a good sence, as here, and infinite like places both in the old and new Testament; In an euill sence, as to walke in sinne, in darkenesse, &amp;c. both which I haue shewed at large; From both acceptations, it is more than manifest; that, <hi>to walke,</hi> signifieth, to leade our
<pb n="12" facs="16"/> liues orderly, warily, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, and to haue our conuersation euery way suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to those waies which God hath set downe in his word, neither declining to the right hand, nor to the left; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of <hi>Salomon: Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the path of thy feete, and let all thy waies be established, Turne not to the right hand, nor to the left, Prou.</hi> 4. 26. 27. and to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Make streight steppes for your feete, lest that which is lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> be turned out of the way, Heb. 12. 13. And, take heed that yee walke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly, Ephes.</hi> 5. 15. Thus, to walke, is to liue thus and thus; to leade our liues in this and that; to order our liues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this and that, taking the word of God for our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule, to the obedience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our whole liues are framed, and by which, all our actions towards God &amp; man, through
<pb n="13" facs="16"/> the whole course of our liues are ordered and squared. This is to walke in Gods wayes; which may well be explained by the saying of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Psalme: <hi>To him that ordereth his conuersation aright, will I shew the saluation of God, Psal.</hi> 50. 23. making the walking in Gods waies, and the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our conuersation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, all one in effect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of this word, <hi>Walke,</hi> in the bad sence, saith, that the <hi>Colossians</hi> walking in sinne, was liuing in sinne; <hi>in which, ye also walked sometime, when ye liued in them, Coloss.</hi> 3. 7. so say I, speaking in the good sence; then doe we walke in Gods waies, when we liue in them. Whence we must note, that it is not a bare talking and discoursing about Gods wayes, that will serue turne, but a walking and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in them; not to know
<pb n="14" facs="17"/> them, but to doe them; not onely to be informed of them in our iudgements, nor onely conformed to them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew, but transformed inwardly, by the renewing of our mindes, and reformed wholly in the practise of our liues.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, this spirituall walke hath relation, first, to God; secondly, to Man. Both must be regarded, and great heed must be taken how wee walke both before God and men: for there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, into which men commonly fall; the one is, so they haue a good heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God inwardly, (as they say) they neuer care how they seeme to their brethren; whereas the duties of pietie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in the first Table must shew themselues in the duties of charity, and the light of an holy example to their
<pb n="15" facs="17"/> brethren in the second Table. The other is, so they can liue a ciuill honest life, and make a faire shew to the world, to blinde the eyes of men, they care not what they doe, nor how prophanely and lewdly they carry themselues in the sight and presence of the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing God.</p>
   <p>First, to walke with God, or to walke before God, is so to carry our selues, as in the sight and presence of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his all-seeing eye, discerning all our thoughts, words, and deedes, and admitting him to be the iust iudge of them all, and of the whole course of our liues: or, to walke before God, is to lead a holy and godly life, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to offend God in any thing, being fully perswaded, that wheresoeuer, among whosoeuer, or whatsoeuer doing, that God himselfe
<pb n="16" facs="18"/> stands by vs, beholding and obseruing all our actions, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thoughts, and will iudge them all. It is (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath it in the song of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie) to serue God without ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare, in holines &amp; righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before him all the daies of our life, Luke</hi> 1. 74. 75. Thus did <hi>Enoch; He walked with God, Gen.</hi> 5. 24. Thus, after him did <hi>Abraham; The Lord, before whom I walke, Gen.</hi> 24. 40. So did <hi>Dauid,</hi> purposing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing so to doe; <hi>I will walke before God in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, Psal.</hi> 116. 9. Thus did good King <hi>Hezekiah; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee O Lord, remember now, how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy sight, 2 King.</hi> 20. 3. And so must all of vs doe, that looke to liue with him in glory; according to Gods commandement giuen to
<pb n="17" facs="18"/>
      <hi>Abraham.</hi> and so to vs all, <hi>Walke before me, and be vpright, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. In all which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, especially that of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> wee may obserue; first, this dutie of walking before God; secondly, the manner of it, which is two-fold; first, in truth; secondly, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, that is, an vpright heart; thirdly, his exercise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> this his walking; first, doing, secondly, that which was good; thirdly, not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of men onely, to be seene of them, but as approuing his heart vnto God, hee did all in his sight. Fourthly, his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed practise, through the whole course of his life, after conuersion, <hi>I haue walked, and I haue done;</hi> speaking of the time of his former life, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it till death, where we may see, walking before God, and doing of good must goe together: Fiftly, the clearenesse
<pb n="18" facs="19"/> of his good conscience, out of which he appeales to God; for this was not any pride, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous conceit, that this good King had of himselfe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any way to iustifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before God, but it was his peace of conscience, <hi>which passeth all vnderstanding:</hi> Hee knew well (that I may vse the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) <hi>that he had liued in all good conscience before God vntill this day, Acts 23. 1. and that he had exercised himselfe to haue alwaies a conscience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence toward God and toward men, Acts 24. 16. His consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bearing him witnesse in the holy Ghost, Rom. 9. 1.</hi> Out of this good conscience, I say, he appealeth to God; saying, <hi>I beseech thee O Lord, remember how I walked, &amp;c.</hi> A most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy patterne of all, both high and low, to be followed, that wee may so
<pb n="19" facs="19"/> walke before God both in life and death.</p>
   <p>This continuall walking before God, to consider that wee are alwaies in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is, first, a speciall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die against sinne, and a mota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes to make vs liue in the feare of God. This kept <hi>Ioseph</hi> from vncleanenesse, <hi>Gen. 39. 9. Iob</hi> from impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 18. The Mid-wiues from murther, <hi>Exod. 1. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in obedience, <hi>Gen. 22. and 25. chapters. Dauid</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity: Secondly, this is a maine signe that we are friends with God, and that he is well pleased with vs. So <hi>Enoch,</hi> by walking with God, is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, <hi>to haue pleased God, Heb.</hi> 11. 5. All our glorious workes without this, are nothing; <hi>He hath shewed thee O man, what is good, and what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee; surely to doe iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to loue mercy, and to</hi>

      <hi>humble thy selfe, to walke with thy God, Micah.</hi> 6. 7. 8. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> saith, <hi>Can two walke together, except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed? Amos</hi> 3. 3. Vnder which interrogatiue, is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this negatiue; two cannot walke together except they be agreed; and if they doe walke together, it is a signe they are agreed: So those that walke with God, are at agreement with him; <hi>In Christ hee is well pleased with them, Mat.</hi> 3. 17. and being at agreement with him, shall continually haue his loue and fauour extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; as hee that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the Kings presence cannot but be highly in his fauour, who dare wrong him? <hi>Yea, what shall be done to the man whom the King will honour, whom hee delighteth to honour? Thus and thus shall it be done to the man whom the King will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Esth.</hi> 6. 6. 9. 11. If this
<pb n="21" facs="20"/> be so among those who are in fauour with earthly Kings, then what honour shall they haue, that are alwaies in Gods presence, and daily tread his Courts? A thousand times blessed are they, <hi>for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will honour those that honour him, 1 Sam. 2. 30. Hee is with those that are with him 2 Chron. 15. 2. and if God be with them, who can be against them? Rom. 8. 31. Yea, hee is with them in trouble he will deliuer them, and honour them; with long life hee will satisfie them, and shew them his saluation, Psal.</hi> 14. 15. 16. Thus, as they haue walked with God here, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, they shall for euer liue with him in glory; which is meant, <hi>Reuel. 3. 4. They shall walke with Christ in white, for they are worthy;</hi> not as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gather for the worthinesse of their workes, but of their persons,
<pb n="22" facs="21"/> accepted of God as righteous in Christ, his righteousnesse being imputed to them, and made theirs.</p>
   <p>The second kinde of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is towards men: first, Publique; secondly, Priuate. Publique walking concernes, first, the members of the Church, and all beleeuers; secondly, those which are out of the Church. <hi>Towards the first, we must walke in loue, peace, humility, meekenesse, &amp;c. Walke in loue, as Christ hath loued vs, Ephes. 5. 1. Walke with all lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and meekenesse, with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, forbearing one another in loue, endeauouring to keepe the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace Ephes. 4. 1. 2. 3. And this is loue, that wee walke after his commandements; This is the commandement, that as yee haue heard from the beginning, yee should walke in it, Iohn 2. epist. verse 6.</hi> Wee must walke, and
<pb n="23" facs="21"/> liue so, giuing no iust cause of scandall &amp; offence, but shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good example to all men, in all things. <hi>We are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light, we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore walke as children of the light, Ephes. 5. 8. Letting our light, of an holy example, so shine before others, that they may see our good workes, and glorifie God, Math. 5. 16.</hi> Towards the latter wee must walke, wisely, honestly, no-offensiuely; taking great heed to our waies, and hauing a speciall care of our carriage, that in nothing wee giue any iust cause, either of exception or of offence, to the wicked and vnbelieuers. <hi>Walke wisely towards those which are without, redeeming the time, Colos. 4. 5. Study to be quiet, &amp;c. that yee may walke honestly toward them which are without, 1 Thes 4. 11, 12.</hi> Walke towards them, but not with them. To walke with them, is to walke as they, to
<pb n="24" facs="22"/> liue, and doe as they. To walke towards them, is meant to walke and liue amongst them and as occasion serues to haue any dealing with them; in all our carriage amongst them, wee must doe all things to the glory of God and good of others. <hi>Wee must liue so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that wee may be blamelesse and harmelesse, the Sonnes of God, without rebuke, in the middest of a crooked and peruerse nation, among whom shine yee as lights in the world, Phil. 2. 15.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Priuate walking, concernes either our selues, or others; as our Children, Seruants, and families. In regard of our selues, wee must walke in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse and singlenesse of heart, approuing our hearts to God, <hi>endeauouring that wee may be accepted of God, 2 Cor. 5. 9.</hi> with the Philippians, <hi>not in presence of others onely, but much</hi>
      <pb n="25" facs="22"/>
      <hi>more in their absence to obey God, Philip. 2. 12. exercising our selues to haue alwaies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science void of offence, toward God and man, Acts 24.</hi> that when wee are falsly accused, slandered or reproached, our conscience may excuse, not accuse vs, so that we can true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, <hi>I suffer vniustly, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science bearing me witnesse in the holy Ghost, Rom. 9. 1.</hi> Thus in priuate, to giue our selues to prayer, to reading, to searching of the Scriptures with them of <hi>Berea,</hi> diligently, and daily, <hi>Acts 17. 11.</hi> to often medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Gods word, and of his workes; and in a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and calling to minde of our wayes, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and resoluing for time to come to amend things amisse, daily renewing our vowes, and performing them: and whatsoeuer wee doe, to doe it heartily, as to the Lord, who
<pb n="26" facs="23"/> seeth our hearts.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in regard of those in our families, our Wiues, Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to shew all good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to follow our particular callings diligently, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all vnder our charge to doe the like: <hi>to instruct our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in points of religion, and to bringvp our Children in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and information of the Lord, Ephes.</hi> 6. 4. that we can truely say, <hi>I and my house doe serue the Lord, Ioshua</hi> 24. 15. wee must reprooue sinne in our Children and Seuants, and not suffer them to sinne; to make a discreet choise of our Seruants, <hi>making much of all those that feare the Lord, Psal:</hi> 15. to cast out of our houses, the wicked and vngodly, the lyar, slaunderer, swearer, idle, theefe, adulterer, fornicators, and the like, not enduring them to carry in our sight.
<pb n="27" facs="23"/> Excellent is the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> worthy of all men in this priuate walke to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and let vs marke it. <hi>I will</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) behaue my selfe wisely in a perfect way; I will walke within my house with a perfect heart; I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the workes of them that turne aside, it shall not cleaue to mee; A froward heart shall depart from mee, I will not know a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; who so priuily flaundereth his neighbour, him will I cut off, him that hath an high looke, and a proud heart, will I not suffer; Mine eyes shall be vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the land, that they may dwell with me; He that walketh in a perfect way, hee shall serue mee; Hee that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house; He that telleth lyes, shall not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in my sight, Psal.</hi> 101. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Let all Gouernours, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Masters of families,
<pb n="28" facs="24"/> walke thus as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; not follow him in his adultery, or making <hi>Vriah</hi> drunke, or murther, which is a common practise of a number; but as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Follow him as hee followes Christ, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 1. Let vs walke by this rule prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this Psalme, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let vs walke by the same rule, let vs minde the same thing: And marke them which walke so, as you haue vs for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Philip.</hi> 3. 16, 17. This is that well ordered walke, which beseemeth all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which puts a maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the children of God, and the wicked, whose whole course of life is out of order, neither walking with God: <hi>For they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world. Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. nor yet walking in any good course, or duty amongst men: These <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of; <hi>Many walke, of whom I haue</hi>

         </gap>. 18, 19. These walke disorderly; from whom, wee are commanded, in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, to withdraw our selues, 2. Thessal.</hi> 3. 6, 11. These the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> speaks of, denouncing a woe against them: <hi>Woe vnto them, for they haue walked in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>Iude</hi> 11. Lastly, note briefly, that walking vprightly before God, and inoffensiuely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, must alwayes goe together; and that walking implies continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and holding out in Gods wayes vnto the ende; for, <hi>hee that continueth vnto the end shall be saued, Matth.</hi> 24. 13. And, <hi>in due time wee shall reape if wee faint not, Gal.</hi> 6. 9. Therefore, <hi>euer follow that which is good, both among your</hi>

      <hi>selues, and to all men, 1. Thes.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
   <p>The second point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the wayes wherein we must walke; In which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, 1. what these wayes are; 2. why called Gods wayes. <hi>They walke in his wayes.</hi> The wayes of God are set downe in Scripture to bee of two sorts. 1. Such as properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne himselfe, and which he himselfe walketh. 2. Such as concerne vs, and in which we may, and ought to walke. The first, are two-fold; Secret: Reuealed. The secret or more <note place="margin">The wayes of God are two-fold.</note> hidden wayes of God, are the wayes of his Iudgements, Counsels, Wisedome, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, secret will, his minde, in the Creation, disposition, &amp; gouernement of all things. <hi>Hae viae magis adorandae, quam cognoscendae;</hi> that is, <hi>These wayes of God are rather to bee</hi>
      <pb n="31" facs="25"/>
      <hi>adored of all, than knowne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> These are not the wayes here meant; neither doe they, being secret and abstruse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto vs: <hi>For Secret things belong to God, Reuealed things to vs, Deut.</hi> 29. 29. For there is such a bottomlesse depth of Gods secret wayes, as it is impossible for any mortall man to know them. Of these S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh; <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God; how vnsearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes past finding out! For who hath knowen the minde of the Lord, or who hath beene his counseller? Rom.</hi> 11. 23. and <hi>Esa.</hi> 40. 14.</p>
   <p>The Reuealed, or more manifest wayes of God, are such as hee hath reuealed in his Word, contained in the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles. And these reuealed
<pb n="32" facs="26"/> things belong to vs, and wee must know them. Of these speakes the Psalme, <hi>Hee made knowne his wayes vnto</hi> Moses, <hi>his acts vnto the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Psal.</hi> 103. 7. These wayes are the waies of Gods works, and marueilous acts his signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied will, as reue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> wayes, and holy in all his workes, Psal.</hi> 145. 17.</p>
   <p>These wayes are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from all other wayes, by diuers Epithets giuen vnto them in the Word. They are called, <hi>Good wayes, and right, 1. Sam. 12. 23. Psalm. 2. 12. 1. King</hi> 8. 36. Secondly, <hi>an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled way, and perfect, Psal.</hi> 18
<pb n="33" facs="26"/> 30. Thirdly, <hi>a holy way, Esa.</hi> 35. 8. Fourthly, <hi>a chosen way, Psal.</hi> 25. 12. Fiftly, <hi>a straight way, Matth. 7. 14. Luke</hi> 13. 24. Sixtly, <hi>the way of life, Psal. 16. 11 Prou.</hi> 6. 23. Seuenthly, <hi>the way of truth, Psal</hi> 119. 3. Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the way of wisedome, Prou</hi> 4. 11. Ninthly, <hi>the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, Prou.</hi> 8. 20. and 16. 31 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Tenthly, <hi>the way of peace, Rom. 3. 17. Luke</hi> 1. 79. Lastly, <hi>Equall, Ezech.</hi> 18. 25. with many such like stiles, as are giuen to Gods wayes: All and each of which, should teach vs to bee rauished with these wayes, to set our hearts vpon them, to loue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, to learne them, and know them, to teach them others, to search and enquire for them, and so to walke in them, that is, to liue in them, and to frame the whole course of our liues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, which is
<pb n="34" facs="27"/> the property of all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the Text hath it, <hi>They walke in his wayes:</hi> I proceede to the second.</p>
   <p>Now, the wayes of God which concerne vs, &amp; which we must walke, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two wayes; General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Specially. Generally; this way, is the way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, entring into the course of Christian Religion, and professing the Gospel of Christ, and the doctrine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That this is called a way, appeareth in these places, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 9. when <hi>Paul</hi> was instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the doctrine of Christian Religion, disputing and perswading things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdome of God, it is said, <hi>Diuers spake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of that way. Saul</hi> the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter desired to bring bound to Ierusalem all that hee should finde in this way, <hi>Act.</hi>
      <pb n="35" facs="27"/> 9. 2. yea, hee persecuted this way vnto the death, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 4. There arose no small stirre about that way, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 23. So <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 22. In all these places is vnderstood the way of Christian Religion, and the profession of the doctrine of the Gospel, or some speciall point thereof, as appeareth by the Context.</p>
   <p>The General way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion is necessary vnto saluation, without it wee cannot come to heauen, and yet this alone being but a bare profession cannot bring a man to heauen; This is the way of a number, euen of such as goe for professors, that yet for all this shall neuer come in heauen: <hi>Not euery one that saith vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, Matth.</hi> 7. 21. that is, Not euery one that beares the
<pb n="36" facs="28"/> name of a Christian, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth the Name of Christ, and God to be his God, shall bee saued; not euery one that makes an outward shew of profession, that can talke, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and discourse of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and points of doctrine, though they may haue most excellent and rare gifts, shall bee saued: For many shall pleade for themselues at the day of iudgement, saying, <hi>Lord, Lord, haue wee not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in thy Name? and in thy Name cast out deuils? and in thy Name done many maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes, and then hee will professe vnto them, hee neuer knew them: Depart from mee yee workers of iniquitie, Matt.</hi> 7. 22. There are many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the Church, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong professors, who will make profession of God with their mouthes, but denie him in the practise of their liues.
<pb n="37" facs="28"/>
      <hi>They professe they know God, but by their workes they denie him, being abominable and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to euery good worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16. Thus wee see, that though this be Gods way, which he commandeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. a good way in it selfe, yet not able to bring vs to heauen.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Specially.</hi> The wayes of God wherein we must walke, may properly bee reduced to one head, for indeede there is but one way to heauen, which is called the way of life, the way of saluation; which, in a word, consists in holinesse and righteousnesse; holinesse towards God, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse towards men. But because their are many tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and many windings in this way; I meane, many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required, and many due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bee performed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="29"/> in the plurall number they are called Gods wayes, They walke in his wayes; I will reduce them all to three heads, vnder which all the rest are comprehended.</p>
   <p>The first way, and the <note place="margin">The first way.</note> chiefe, is the way of Faith. This way went all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, and Apostles, and all beleeuers both in the Old and New Testament: A Catalogue of whom, and of their faith, is set downe at large in the whole Chapter, <hi>Heb. 11. For as we beleeue to be saued through the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, so did they, Act. 15. 11. By faith the Elders, and all those beleeuers, through faith, obtained a good report. Heb.</hi> 11. 2, and 39. That this sauing faith is our way to heauen, the Scriptures make it plaine: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Wee walke by faith, not by sight,</hi>
      <pb n="39" facs="29"/> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. To walke by faith, is to liue by faith; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle explanes it, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place out of <hi>Habacuk, The iust shall liue by faith, Heb.</hi> 10. 38. Thus did <hi>Paul: The life which I now liue in the flesh, I liue by the faith of the Sonne of God, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. The whole life of a Christian, both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Temporall, in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and temptations, must be by faith; and that for these reasons. First, because, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not of faith is sinne, Rom.</hi> 14. 23. that is whatsoeuer wee doe with a doubting consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is sinne. Faith must both put a beginning to the work, and perswade vs, that it is pleasing to God. Secondly, <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God in any thing, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. no not in the best things, as preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, and the like. No true preaching without faith;
<pb n="40" facs="30"/> whether wee respect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Minister, who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, who must be faithfull; as Christ exhorts the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Church of <hi>Smyrna, to bee faithfull to the death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 2. 10. or, whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the doctrine which hee teacheth, which must be the word of faith: <hi>This is the word of faith which wee preach vnto you Ro.</hi> 10. 8. So saith <hi>Paul, We beleeue, &amp; therfore speak. 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 13. Againe, No true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without faith; <hi>For whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee aske, beleeuing, we shall obtaine, Mar.</hi> 11. 24. But hee that asketh without faith, is a wauering minded man, <hi>and shall obtaine nothing of the Lord, Iam.</hi> 1. 6, 7. Thus praying without faith, we aske, <hi>but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing, because we aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, Iam.</hi> 4. 3. It must bee the prayer of faith, that must doe the deede, and preuaile with God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 15. Lastly,
<pb n="41" facs="30"/> no profitable hearing the Word without faith: <hi>For the Gospel was preached vnto them of old time, as it is now preached vnto vs, but it did not profit them, because it was not mixt with faith in those who heard it, Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Thirdly, wee must walke by faith, because the things promised and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of vs, are inuisible, and cannot bee beheld in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; as, remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, iustification, the resurrection and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting; Therefore, <hi>faith is the ground of things hoped for, the euidence of things not seene, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. And thus in all the dueties of our generall and particular callings, wee must walke, that is, liue by faith; not to post off all doing of good vntill death, thinking to goe to heauen, with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord haue mercy vpon mee; but hee that will die in
<pb n="42" facs="31"/> faith must liue in faith: No pleasing of GOD without faith; No saluation without pleasing of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation without liuing by faith. To which faith, true repentance must bee ioyned, for one cannot goe without the other; faith must shewe it selfe in the fruits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and howsoeuer the beginnings of repentance are before faith, yet the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it selfe, and the fruits of it follow faith.</p>
   <p>The second way of God, <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way.</note> wherein we must walke, is the way of Gods Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And then are we said to walke in this way, when we yeeld obedience vnto all Gods Commandements; Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right obedience, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, is walking in them. That the Commandements are a way, and obeying of
<pb n="43" facs="31"/> them, is the walking in them, it thus appeareth. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>I will runne the way of thy Commandements, Psal. 119. 32.</hi> Here they are called, a way; <hi>The children of Israel turned out of the way, which their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers walked in, obeying the Commaundements of the Lord, Iudg. 2. 17.</hi> here obedience is walking in this way: For first, their fathers walked in this way: How did they walke? Obeying the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What did the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel? They did turne out of the way, and did not walke in it; How so? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not so as their fathers did, that is, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Therefore thou shalt keepe the Commaundements of the Lord thy God, to walke in his wayes, Deut. 8. 6.</hi> This is the onely thing which God requireth, <hi>And now Israel</hi>
      <pb n="44" facs="32"/>
      <hi>what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to walke in all his wayes? &amp;c. Deut. 10. 12. Yee shall walke after the Lord your God, and feare him, and keepe his Commandements, Deut. 13. 4. Wee must anouch the Lord to bee our God, and to walke in his wayes, &amp;c. And the Lord will anouch vs to bee his peculiar people. Deut. 26. 17, 18. See, I haue set before you this day, life and good, death and euill; life and good, in that I commaund thee this day to loue the Lord thy God, to walke in his wayes, and to keepe his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. Deut. 30, 15, 16.</hi> In all which places it is euident, that to walke in Gods wayes, is to keepe and obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of GOD. For this cause, <hi>Dauid</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this to bee the good and safe way, prayed earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>O let mee not wander from</hi>
      <pb n="45" facs="32"/>
      <hi>thy Commandements, Psal. 119 10.</hi> where we may note, that if wee liue out of this way, of Gods Commandements, wee doe nothing but erre, wander and goe astray. This made <hi>Dauid</hi> so much <hi>to reioice in the way of Gods testimonies, &amp; haue such respect vnto these wayes of God. Psal. 119.</hi> Now this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is walking in them, must bee, first, speedily, without delay: <hi>Dauid</hi> made haste, and delayed not the time, to keepe them, <hi>Psal. 119. 60.</hi> and 2. cheerefully; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> wil runne them: 3. freely, without constraint: 4. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: 5. discreetly; <hi>Dauid,</hi> in comparison of this way, hates all other, <hi>He made choice of the way of trueth, Psal. 119. 30. 6</hi> vprightly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocrisie; <hi>Dauid</hi> kept them with his whole heart:
<pb n="46" facs="33"/> 7. continually, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; <hi>Dauid</hi> kept thē vnto the end: all these are set downe, <hi>Psal. 119.</hi> at large. This was the way of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth; They were both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, walking in all the Commandements of the Lord blamelesse, Luk. 1. 6.</hi> and this is the way, that all must walke in, that looke for heauen. <hi>For Circumcision is nothing, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandements of God, 1. Cor. 7. 19.</hi> that is, in the kingdome of grace, no outward priuiledge or pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence either of Iew or Gentile, is either acceptable to God, or auaileable to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the keeping of Gods Commandements.</p>
   <p>The third way, which God <note place="margin">The third way.</note> hath appointed for vs to walke in, is, The way of good workes. <hi>Boza opera sunt via</hi>
      <pb n="47" facs="33"/>
      <hi>regni, non causa regnandi,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard: Good workes are the way to the heauenly Kingdome, though no cause of reigning in that Kingdome;</hi> They are no meritorious causes of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Papists hold, (for so is onely Christ by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his death and passion) neither can the merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are imperfect, but they are the way which God hath appointed for vs to walk in, and liue in: for, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we are said to be iustified and saued by faith without works, it is to be vnderstood, in the act of iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet not as it is faith, but as it is an instrument to apprehend the obiect Christ; but in the person al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready iustified before God, good workes must concurre, to declare vs before men, that wee are iustified by faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; for though faith
<pb n="48" facs="34"/> alone be said to iustifie vs, yet that faith which is alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good workes, doth not iustifie vs. Good workes are such, as without which, faith is but a dead carkase, as the body without the spirit, and therefore, <hi>shew me thy faith by thy works</hi> at large. <hi>Iam. 2.</hi> And good workes are a way to walke in, S. <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth plainely. <hi>For wee are Gods workemanship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God hath before ordained, that wee should walke in them, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 2. 10.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Papists doe vs great wrong by their slanders, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we teach, that a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified person is freed from all keeping of the Law, and that the law is fulfilled onely in beleeuing, and that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel commands nothing but faith, and the like; thus accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our doctrine of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes;
<pb n="49" facs="34"/> I say, they grosly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse vs, and most falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs; Indeed wee reiect good workes as they are held by the Papists to bee merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious causes of saluation, but setting that aside, and their absurd conceit of the merit of works of supererogation, and wee wil vrge them as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they, though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in that manner as they; yea, we vrge them, and hold them necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not as causes meriting life eternall and saluation, but as they are consequent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which true faith cannot bee; yea, wee hold, that wee cannot attaine to life eternall without them, as they are the way which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that we should walke in them: we hold them necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not as causes of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but effects of it, and to declare vs to be iustified; not
<pb n="50" facs="35"/> deseruing heauen, but the way to walke in; and so we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> we teach, that a man is iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely, and onely by faith, without the worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of the Law; which wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand to bee meant onely in the act of iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and in his sight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> but after a man is thus iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, good workes must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to declare vs to be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="51" facs="35"/> before men; thus saith must be shewed by our good workes: for first wee are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, regenerated, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Christ Iesus vnto good workes (which follow that iustification and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that wee should walke in them. Thus by the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of good workes a good conscience is retained; by a good Conscience, faith is maintained; by faith, Christ is obtained; in Christ life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall is attained. Thus farre of the wayes of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we must walke; and by all which we are discerned from all the wicked. <hi>For they set themselues in no good way. Psal. 36. 4. They say vnto God, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, for wee desire not the knowledge of thy wayes, Iob. 21. 14.</hi> but, <hi>The righteous walke in Gods wayes.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb n="52" facs="36"/>
   <p>Now of the second point, why they are called <hi>Gods waies,</hi> and of this briefly; First, they are called <hi>Gods waies;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is the author, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, commander, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of these waies. <hi>It is he that is the author and finisher of our faith, Heb. 12. 2. It is hee that hath ordained good workes, that we should walke in them, Ephes. 2. 10. It is he which established a Testimony in</hi> Iacob, <hi>and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a law in</hi> Israell, <hi>which he commanded our fore-fathers that they should make them knowne to their children, &amp;c. Psal. 78. 5. It is hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs to feare him, and to walke in all his waies, and to loue him, and to serue him with all our heart, and with all our soules, to keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and his statutes, which he commands vs for our good, Deut. 10. 12. 13.</hi> and almost in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chapter of that booke,
<pb n="53" facs="36"/> they are called, <hi>Gods charge, his statutes, iudgements, ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and commandements</hi> which hee hath commanded. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are all diuine and spirituall, and such as please the Lord; diuine for the matter, which is Christ and his doctrine; <hi>for this way is Christ, as Iohn 14. 6. and no man commeth to the Father but by him;</hi> diuine for the manner; for, first, Christ is the first teacher of them: <hi>Thou tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest the way of God truely, Mat. 22. 16.</hi> and howsoeuer they were vttered and taught by his Prophets and Apostles, <hi>yet these holy men spake as they were moued by the holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1. 21.</hi> Thirdly, God is our onely true guide, who ordereth and directeth vs in this way; <hi>I know that the way of man is not in himselfe; it is not in man that walketh to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his steps, Ier. 10. 23. It is</hi>
      <pb n="54" facs="37"/>
      <hi>God which teacheth vs in the way of wisedome, and leadeth vs in the right pathes, Prou. 4. 11. A mans heart deuiseth his way, but the Lord ordereth his steps, he directs them, Prou. 16. 9. Mans goings are of the Lord, how can a man then vnderstand his owne way? Prou. 20. 24. I am the Lord thy God which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest goe, Esay 48. 17. God shall teach vs of his waies, and we will walke in his pathes. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah 4. 2.</hi> Fourthly, they are such waies as bring vs vnto God; <hi>In the end, we receiue the end of our faith, the saluation of our soules, 1 Pet. 1. 9. Hee that beleeueth, shall not perish, but haue euerlasting life, Iohn 3. 16. What man is he that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth to liue, and would faine see good daies? Depart from euill, and doe good, Psal. 34. 12. To him that ordereth his conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, will I shew the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="37"/> of God, Psal. 50. 23. Aske for the olde pathes, where is the good way, and walke therein, and yee shall finde rest for your soules. Ier. 6. 16. Marke and behold the vpright and iust man, for the end of that man is peace, Psal. 37. 37. He shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beddes, each one walking before God in his vprightnesse, Esay 57. 2. and he that hath walked in Gods statutes, is a iust man, he shall surely liue, Ezech. 18. 9. and 17.</hi> and thus much of the Reasons why they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods waies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Out of all that hath beene spoken, appeareth, first, the Excellency, secondly, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, thirdly, the necessity of these waies, and of this walke. Excellent, because <hi>Gods waies;</hi> excellent, because by walking in them we are the friends of God, and the Sonnes of God. Profitable, <hi>For there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="56" facs="38"/> to those which are in Christ, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit, Rom. 8. 1.</hi> The onely thing that commends vs vnto God, <hi>is walking in obedience to Gods commandements, 1 Cor. 7. 19. and to become new creatures, Gal. 6. 15. And as many as walke according to this rule, peace shall be vpon them, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Israell of God, Gal. 6. 16.</hi> Necessary, <hi>for there are but two wayes, the narrow way, and broad way, and hee that walkes not in the narrow way, as I haue shewed, goes on headlong in the broad way, to his owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Math. 7. 13. 14.</hi> All the knowledge of this way is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without walking in it, and all our reading and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word to learne this way, is nothing, vnlesse we walke in it. <hi>For better it is neuer to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, then after wee
<pb n="57" facs="38"/> haue knowne it, to turne from the commandement, 2 Pet. 2. 21.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To conclude: Seeing these waies of God are so excellent, profitable, and necessary; <hi>Striue to enter in at the straight gate,</hi> (and that betimes) <hi>for many</hi> (when it is too late) <hi>will seeke to enter in, but shall not be able, Luke 13. 24.</hi> And if wee know not the way, <hi>inquire and aske for it, Ier. 6. 16.</hi> Being found, walke and liue in it, and content not our selues with a bare knowledge; <hi>(for he that knoweth his Masters will and doth it not, shall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many stripes, Luke 12. 47.) And take heede that yee walke circumspectly, because the dayes are euill, Ephes. 5. 15.</hi> If at any time wee erre from this way, and step out of it, returne speedily into it again, <hi>The iust man fals often, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth againe, Prou. 24. 16.</hi> And
<pb n="58" facs="39"/> be sure to perseuere and hold on constant in this walke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. <hi>The way of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is to depart from euill; hee that keepeth his way, preserueth his soule, Prou. 16. 17. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse keepeth him that is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way, Prou. 13. 6. The righteous holdeth his way, Iob 23. 11.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> speakes it in the future time, signifying perseuerance; <hi>The waies of the Lord are right, and the iust shall walke in them, Hos. 14. 9.</hi> and so saith the Text, <hi>They walke,</hi> that is, they continue walking, liuing all their daies without fainting) <hi>in Gods waies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, because <hi>it is not in man that walketh, to direct his steps,</hi> as I haue shewed, <hi>Ier. 10. 23.</hi> Therefore wee must pray earnestly vnto Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, to teach vs his way, and to direct our steps, and to guide our feete into the
<pb n="59" facs="39"/> way of peace. Let <hi>Dauids</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall practise herein bee our example. <hi>Shew mee thy wayes O Lord; teach me thy statutes, &amp;c. Psal. 25. 4. Teach mee O Lord the way of thy statutes, and I shall keepe it vnto the end, Psal. 119. 33. O that my waies were directed to keepe thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, verse 5. Make me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the way of thy precepts, verse 27. Make me to goe in the path of thy commandements, verse 35. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, verse 80. Hold thou me vp, and I shall be safe, and I will haue respect vnto thy statutes continually, verse 117. Order my steps in thy word; and let not any iniquity haue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer me. verse 133.</hi> And es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially pray earnestly for the good spirit of God, to guide and leade vs. <hi>Let thy good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit leade me into the land of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, Psal. 143. 10. For Gods way is a way of truth,</hi>
      <pb n="60" facs="40"/>
      <hi>Psal. 119. 30. And the spirit of God will guide vs into all truth, Iohn 16. 13.</hi> And thus much for the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this walke; which I haue penned onely as an ocular Sermon; it being a fit Introduction to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following:</p>
