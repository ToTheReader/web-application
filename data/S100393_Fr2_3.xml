   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two principall employments of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, <hi>Practise,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which two ought to goe ioyntly hand in hand the one with the other, through the whole tenour of each mans life. For by the one is obedience exhibited to Gods will: by the other is helpe and aide craued and procured at Gods hands. Both our <hi>Prayer</hi> therefore ought to be accompanied with <hi>Practise,</hi> and our <hi>Practise</hi> to be seconded with <hi>Prayer.</hi> For the neglect of the one is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God; the neglect of the other is a presuming too much of our selues: Since that neither without our endeauour can any blessing of God be expected, nor any endeauour of ours without his blessing auaile ought. But such is mans misery since the fall of our first Parents, that naturally we faile much and come far short in the knowledge of either of these; neither of our selues well knowing what to doe, nor to aske; and therefore both doing that oft igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly that we ought not, and asking those things vnaduisedly, that are not fit to be asked. Now for the better reformation of our errours in either kind, it hath pleased God, of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to afford vs in his <hi>Word</hi> some speciall helpes and meanes of direction, as well for our practise as for our prayers. The maine direction that God hath giuen vs for our <hi>Practise,</hi> is comprised in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> deliuered in <hi>Mount Sinay:</hi> the maine direction for our <hi>Prayers</hi> is contained in that forme of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which our Sauiour himselfe deliuered to his Disciples in the Gospell. But these both being but briefe Sums, consisting of generall Heads only, and the particular as well <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as <hi>Necessities</hi> of mans Life being infinite; there needeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and vnfoulding of either for the due application thereof to such particular occurrents, as mens daily affaires &amp; occasions minister matter of in either kind. To which purpose as many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men of God haue taken paines, and made publike their godly labours for the good of Gods Church; so this our reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and religious Brother, the Authour of this Worke, now at rest
<pb facs="73"/> with God, hath not come behind any of them in his endeauours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Who, as he spent himselfe while he liued, in the Lords worke for the benefit of others, straining himselfe euen beyond that which the strength of his body would well beare, to instruct those whom God had committed vnto his charge: so hee hath left heere to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie such a worthy Monument of this nature, as may afford plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light to those that are willing to make vse of it, for the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well of their suites as their liues. In commendation whereof I shall need to say little, because the <hi>Worke</hi> sufficiently commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it selfe. Only this I will say of it, that by that short view that I haue had libertie and leasure to take of it, it appeareth vnto me both to be answerable to other the Authour his iudicious &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours already extant; and for perspicuity of <hi>Method,</hi> plenty of <hi>Matter,</hi> and multiplicity of <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> resolued in it, to goe beyond any that I haue hitherto seene in this argument. And albeit difference of Iudgements may be about some particulars therein discussed, (which in so great variety is not to be maruailed) yet I doubt not but that the diligent <hi>Reader,</hi> that maketh conscience of his courses, shall heere find sound &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground as well to settle his <hi>Iudgement</hi> as to regulate his <hi>practise</hi> in an innumerable number of such questions and cases as the occurrents and occasions of his life may produce. The worke (it seemeth) was prepared by the Authour himselfe for the Presse, and printed also some part of it before his discease, and had it beene the Lords will, I should heartily wish, that hee had surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue seene the finishing and publishing of it himselfe. But the Lord hath prouided better for him, and putting an end to his Labours, hath translated him thither, where he enioyeth now the reward of them. In the way to which end if this worke of his shall further thee, (and it is thine owne fault if it doe not) giue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God; and be thankefull to him, who hath afforded so plentiful light in these latter times vnto vs, ouer that which former ages haue had. To his gracious blessing (without which neither this nor ought else can auaile ought) commending thee, this worke, and thy perusall of it, I take leaue of thee, and rest</p>
