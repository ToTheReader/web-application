   <p>It is certainely an injury to our predecessors to suffer their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories and labours to perish,
<pb facs="6"/>
who tooke such great paines and travailes for the benefit of us, and succeeding generations: I have therefore in this booke se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many, and those speciall observations, out of Authentick Authors, famous for their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and approoved for truth in all ages, containing the acts of many Emperours and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Solemnization of their birth-dayes, with the Triumphs and Pompes that were then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as also their Funeralls, the destrunction of many Cities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>: they containe also many Customes, Rites, Conditions, manners of many strange Nations, and describing the properties and natures of sundry Creatures, as Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and also of Mettalls, and Minerals, as Gold, Silver, Lead, Quick-silver, Iron,
<pb facs="6"/>
and the like; as also remarkable things of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> and their Prophesies, with the Orders of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> that are now the most famous through the world: the beginnings and invention of many <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> as of <hi>Printing,</hi> and the invention of the great <hi>Bombards,</hi> and such like, which I doubt not but will yeeld satisfaction to all that are addicted to these kinds of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Now there will not want those that will be readier to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, then to encourage my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this kinde, objecting that it seemes to be needlesse to read them here, when as they can have them in the proper Authours: I answer, though some few may be so well stored with <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Bookes,</hi> yet there bee thousands that neither are furnished with <hi>Bookes,</hi> nor
<pb facs="7"/>
yet with the <hi>Languages</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours writ in, and so are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived of this benefit. Howsoever, I have laboured, and I repent mee not; for this <hi>Booke</hi> will bee beneficiall to all that shall without prejudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions read it, and herein they have the choycest flowers, pickt and cull'd out of many <hi>Gardens</hi> for their benefit, and what more is, they may in lesse time, and little charges obtaine their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires by this, which they cannot by many Bookes: For reading with a strict collection, (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the difficulty of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is knowne to all men of judgement to be difficult, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and troublesome; yet I weigh none of these, so that my Labours may afford any profit to the perusers of them.
