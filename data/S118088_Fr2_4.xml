                 <title>A short compend of the historie of the first ten persecutions moued against Christians : divided into III. centuries. Whereunto are added in the end of euery centurie treatises arising vpon occasion offered in the historie, clearely declaring the noveltie of popish religion, and that it neither flowed from the mouthes of Christs holy Apostles, neither was it confirmed by the blood of the holy martyrs who died in these ten persecutions</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N writing of <hi>COMPENDES,</hi> euery man, who hath presumed to doe such a worke, hath found difficulties: and it hath not beene an easie thing to any man, to satisfie either himselfe or others, beeing inuironed with many straites. If he be short in his Compend, hee seemeth obscure: if hee write at length, then his Compend seemeth to haue need of an other Compend, to abridge his prolixity. Yet in all these difficulties, it is better to set forward, to doe some good, both to our selues and others, then to spend our time in idlenes, lest our cogitations bee like vnto the vpper and lower Milne-stones, lacking good graine to grind vpon, they rub vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently one vpon another, vntill both be broken: and incase our cogitations bee not well exercised, our thoughtes will bee spent vpon vaine things, which wil procure harme both to our soules and bodies.</p>
   <p>In my <hi>TREATISES</hi> I haue ouerpassed with silence the question anent Festuall dayes, lest I should seeme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>t one time to contend both against friends &amp; foes, as some men haue done, who if they had more increased their charitie, and diminished the feruent heat of their contentious spirits, they had benefited the Church of Christ more then they haue done. Would GOD

      <hi>LUCAS OSIANDER</hi> had walked in the foote-steps of Christian loue.</p>
   <p>Now I will begge this fauour at thee, Christian Reader, that my weake trauels may be taken in good part. The house of our GOD in this land is large and ample (praised bee his moste holy NAME therefore) it hath need of bright-shining tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for the Halles, Parlours, and Chambers: and it hath need of smaller Lightes, for Sellers and office houses: let my pennie Candle giue light in the lowest Seller of the House of our GOD, and mine heart is fully content.</p>
