   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, my love &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verēce
to the author living,
and to his memorie being
dead: &amp; my desire to serve
the church of God by other
mens woorks, who am not able to doe it
by myne owne: have moved me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
this learned treatise, which Doctor
<hi>Rainolds</hi> left (as many other exquisit tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of his) shutt vp in the closett of some
private frends as in a fayre prison.</p>
   <p>Because my testimonie (or any mans
I know) is of much lesse waight then the
onely name of the author to cōmend the
woorke, I will say nothing more in praise
of it, then that it is an vndoupted woorke
of that worthie &amp; holy man, whose learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dilligence, abilleties, meeknes, wisdō,
&amp; pietie made him eminent to vs, &amp; may
<pb facs="3"/>
perhaps yeeld him more admirable to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretie,
which without envie of his person
shal view the marks of thies graces in his
writings, or take them by storie.</p>
   <p>Touching the argument I will onely
say, that it seemeth the more woorthy
such a mans resolution, by how much it
hath bene formerly, or presētly is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
amongst the learned. And if anie
man be cōtrarie minded to this, which is
the common iudgement of the reformed
churches, he (above others) shalbe my
debttor, for helping him to so good a mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of reforming himselfe: In matters of
opinion (chiefly divine) he that conquer
eth &amp; he that is is cōquered devide both
honor &amp; proffit.</p>
   <p>If any man take good by it, let him give
praise to God, if he take none, let him blāe
none but himselfe: The next page will
shew the contents, &amp; order of the booke,</p>
   <p>The booke it selfe wil shew thee how
good it is. <hi>fare-well.</hi>
