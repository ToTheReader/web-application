      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV, it was, mine Honourable
and worthy Friends, to whom
(next after our Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
these ensuing Sermons
were first and chiefly directed: You may iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
then claime a part in them: and I wish
they may prove as fruitfull unto you, as they
were intended. Sure I am, they wil not prove
unfruitfull, if you compose your selves to the
Glass they hold forth, striving to present you
such to your Master, as they represent to you;
that is, such as seek not to rise, save to get the
vantage-ground for the doing of more good:
such, as preferre their Masters good before
their owne gain; their Masters safety before
<pb facs="6"/>
their owne ease, their Masters credit before
their owne advancement: such, as in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
sutes aim not at their private ends th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the sides of the Publike, nor use faire
pretenses for the compassing of foule proiects
or the smothering of honest motions; nor, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly,
look so much to the purse and power of
Petitioners, as to their worths and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
   <p>A Master you have, born (I hope) in a
happy houre for the good of the Christian
world: of whom it may bee truely said,
<q>
         <l>Antevenit sortem meritis, virtutibus
annos,</l>
         <l>Ingenio formam, relligione genus▪</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Who not onely rewards and cherishes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but traceth out the path therof before you
with his own steps; best deserving that place,
by his ingraven courtesie and many Princely
endowments, which hee houlds by lineall des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Why then should any seek that favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
in the way of basenes and sycophancie, which
may more easily bee won in the plain and safe
way of vertue and honesty?</p>
   <p>Provocations to vice (I knowe) are not
wanting in the place wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

house; what may wee there expect, where
from the Chiefest are so many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to piety? in that Family, whose Head
(I dare say) rather glories in being a member
of the true Church, than the Second in the
Kingdome; rather in beeing baptized into the
religion hee professeth, than in beeing descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the royall stock of so many famous
Kings: and where religion is built up (be it
spoken without disparagement of other mens
labours, or relation to mine owne) by as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Master-workmen in their kindes▪ as
the Land affords; not thrusting themselves
into the Place, but all of them culled out and
called thither: not posting to Preferment by
indirect means; but, like sacred Lamps,
spending themselves to give you light, well
testified by your singular respect towards
them.</p>
   <p>Of my self, or this ensuing Worke, I will
say nothing. By the grace of God I am that I
am: and I hope it will appear in this Worke,
<pb facs="7"/>
and the effects therof in you, that his grace in
me was not altogether in vain. Whatsoever it
bee, it is for your use: and whatsoever I am,
I am for your service; ready to bee imployed
by the meanest of that Family, for which I
