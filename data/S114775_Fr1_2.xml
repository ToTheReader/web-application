      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Honour, Worship, or other
Worthinesse whatsoever (good
Reader) hath often heard it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the mouth of many a
well-read and experienced man
in Physicke, That <hi>(Urina est meretrix, vel
mendax)</hi> the Vrine is an Harlot, or a Lier;
and that there is no certaine knowledge of any
Disease to be gathered from the Vrine alone,
nor any safe judgement to be exhibited by the
same: You have been (likewise) often told, by
Physicians, that it were farre better for the
Physician to see his Patient once than to view

men of that fond opinion, of a Physicians dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
diseases by it, wherewith they have been
so long time deluded. To this purpose hath Dr
<hi>Cotta</hi> written a Booke (called, <hi>A short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie
of the unobserved dangers of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
sorts of ignorant and (inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
practisers of Physicke in England)</hi>
wherein, amongst other Tracts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
abusers of Physicke, he hath written one Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
of the Conjectours by Vrines: therein
shewing the falshood, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> judgment
of Diseases by the Vrine. He hath also therein
set downe the ingenuous confession of a dying
Physician (made to him being then present with
him some three or foure dayes before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb facs="3"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, who, being requested to commend unto

      </gap> admired and esteemed, for judging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
to be with childe by their Vrine, made
this ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er. I have (saith he) long with the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of a good opinion exercised it, and with
tryed certainty know it to be uncertainty, and
certaine deceit: It is therefore unworthy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and the name of Art. Reade the Tract
above mentioned, and you shall see this confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
further amplified. If you please to take my
confession too, you shall have it: I for mine owne
part have been so fortunate herein, that I have
seldome failed an my predictions of determining
a woman to be with childe by the Vrine, as I
have made them beleeve, when the messenger
hath been able to certifie me of the state of the
Womans body, and could answer me to certaine
other questions touching other signes of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Above all the rest, I was once magnified
by a Counsellors wife for this cunning cozenage
(I am not ashamed to terme it so) at a festivall
meeting at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the presence of two
(as I take it) other Doctours of Physicke: She
told them to their faces that I was the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningst
Doctour in all the Towne, for I had told
her by her water that she was with child, and
<pb facs="4"/>
just how long it was since she conceived of it▪
But had the woman shew'd me (that brought it)
no more than the Vrine did, I should scarce have
adventured to have pronounced her to have been
with childe: Yet I might (knowing the Gentlewoman,
how long it was since she had a child, and
the distance that she commonly kept in child-bearing,
as also that she nursed her children
her selfe) have pronounced her, and that upon
some probable conjecture, to have beene with
child, though the messenger could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me to such interrogatives (as we use to
demand of them before we pronounce a woman
to be with childe) nor the Vrine shew (as it doth
not) any thing concerning conception at all. I
dare say, that the good Gentlewoman is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that I determined her to be with childe
by the sight of her Vrine onely, because I did not
intimate any thing to the contrary: Neither
is she to be so much blamed for her credulity, as
I for my jugling. But to make her and other
good women amends (whom I have thus beguil'd)
I have in this ensuing Tract set downe the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies,
by which I judged her, and every other
Physician doth judge every other woman to be
with childe; as also, by which we give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Disease, Sex, and the like, seeming
<pb facs="4"/>
to doe it onely by the Vrine: which have not
heretofore beene published (though too much
practized of most) by any man in the English
tongue. Doctour <hi>Hart</hi> (in his Booke intituled
<hi>The Anatomie of Urines)</hi> hath by suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
argument and demonstration, confuted the
Pisse-Canons, or Conjectures of Vrines, taken
from the severall accidents of the same (as the
severall colours, parts, contents, substance,
quantity, smell) and shewed their falshood in all
these, and the many absurdities that have been
committed by pretending knowledge of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
by all these; I thought it likewise fit to set
downe the fallacies; by which judgement of
Diseases is given by the Vrine, to the end that
the writings of other men (who have written
against this base custome of Water-prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
may gaine the more credit, and for the
further satisfaction of such as yet remaine
doubtfull whether there be any judgment to
be taken from the Vrine sufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the disease. To this end therefore I have
set downe the fallacies which have upheld this
custome of prating, and predicating strange
things by the Vrine: And I have pen'd them in
the English tongue, because that meere Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen
(I meane the common people) who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb facs="5"/>
English only, are and ever have ben most
subject to be deceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> deluded. I hope
therefore that no Artist will be offended hereat,
for I dare say that there is no ingenuous man,
but is of mine opinion, and would as gladly (as
I my selfe) that this base custome, of Lecturing
upon the Vrine, were overthrowne and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
What I have therefore done to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I intreat the courteous Reader to accept
in as good part, as I have been willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the same: And for as much as I have
been guilty of this fraud, though I have not
long used it, let it suffice that it repenteth me
of the same, for I meane never hereafter to shew
my cunning, or rather cozening, upon the water,
and hope that other men will helpe to beate down
this custome, or else all that I have written will
be to little purpose. However it will some thing
delight the understanding and impartiall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and might profit the ignorant, if they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ould make use of it to that end for which it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> penn'd. As for the stile, and method of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it is poore and meane; but such as best
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> with such a poore, base, and stinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
I have been enforced a little beyond my
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> nature, and disposition, to bee somewhat
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> in lecturing upon the Vrine, for which
<pb facs="5"/>
cause I may incurre censure of the graver and
more modest people: If I have herein offended,
I crave their pardon, for I could not well avoid
it: And let them not taxe me of levity, or
lasciviousnesse, for my life and conversation
hath, and shall for ever testifie the contrary.
Howbeit I can claime no priviledge from back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,
nor immunity from malignant tongues;
I refuse to be tryed by a prejudicate opinion,
or the malignant spirit of contradiction; and
appeale unto the learned, judicious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
Reader, to whom (if I have erred)
for it is <hi>Humanum errare)</hi> I submit for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
if need be, for correction. And for as
much as (I feare) that the greatest detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
that I shall finde (though it be an old
saying that the Arts, <hi>Nullum habent ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum
praeter ignorantem,</hi> have no enemy
but the ignorant man) are offenders in this
kinde; I admonish you (brother Pisse-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
that you be not too busie in playing the
Criticke upon mee, because I have (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
mine owne folly) reproved your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which you will hardly forsake. As for
the censure of the ignorant (whom you help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in this prejudicate opinion) I regard it
not. <hi>Hos oblatrantes caniculos cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu,</hi>

      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> I psse by these barking Curres (as the lion doth)
with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> But if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

      </gap>(whose gall'd back i have rub'd,
and whose sore I have lanced) who are conscious to
your selfe of your owne guiltinesse herein, I shall
rub harder and lance deeper: and yet (if you
kick over-much) I shall finde a Lash to quiet
you. I pray therefore let me have your good
word, lest you need mine. And so in hope that
the learned, judicious, and impartiall Reader
will pardon my errours, and that the ignorant
Reader will become wiser, and that the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Reader will become honester, I rest▪</p>
