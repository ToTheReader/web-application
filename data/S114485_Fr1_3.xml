   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, in the last edition of the Historie of France, I did
willingly omit all matters acted by the Spaniards, wherein the
French were not principally interressed, hauing then a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make the Histories of those countries distinct and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat.
And for that I would not leaue you long in suspence, I
promised within the yeare to publish this Historie of Spaine:
wherein (notwithstanding my publique seruice, and many other difficulties) I
haue forced my selfe to keepe my word, and to giue you satisfaction, though it
be with some preiudice to my health. I will not vse many complements in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of the Author, his worke shall plead for himselfe: This Historie was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a Frenchman, who is yet liuing, a man of grauitie and iudgement: It is
no translation, but a collection out of the best writers that haue treated of that
subiect. his chiefe Authors were <hi>Stephen Garebay, Ierome Surites, Mariana,
Ambrose Morales, Iohn Vasee</hi> a Fleming, with many other Spanish, Italian &amp;
Latin writers: out of all which he hath compyled this worke, and as it were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and tyed together the discourse of all these realmes with a continued style,
by reason of the warre, accords, marriages, and other treaties and alliances which
they haue had common among them: yet hath he so distinguished them, as seeing
them all, you may easily read any one seuerally by it selfe, by the direction of notes
and inscriptions set in the margent at euerie section or breach, whereby you may
choose what belongs to Nauarre, Portugall, Castille, or to any other of those
realmes, and read the Historie apart from the beginning to the end.</p>
   <p>The antiquitie of this Spanish Nation (wherof he hath breefely made mention in
the beginning of the first Booke) he confesseth to be obscure and vncertaine, and
the writers thereof ignorant or negligent, so as it may be his discourse agreeth
not with some authors which treat of the same men of whom he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as of <hi>Hercules, Cacus, Gerion, Denis,</hi> and such like; but he pleads thus
much for himselfe, that he could not contemne nor reiect the Spanish authors
which haue so written of them, the which are to be receiued as obserued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by them. This Historie comes but to the winning of the Terceres, which
was in the yeare 1583: he hath finished the rest vnto these times, I my selfe haue
seene it in his studie at Paris, but he hath not yet put it to the Presse, so as I haue
beene constrained, in the continuance thereof, to helpe my selfe out of the best
that haue written of these later times, wherein I haue been assisted by some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
gentlemen in the relation of some great actions, and haue continued the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="4"/>
vnto my Lord Admirals returne out of Spaine. You must not hold it strange,
if you find a great part of <hi>Philip</hi> the seconds raigne barren of any great actions
done in Spaine: his chiefe designes were against foreine States, imploying his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
men abroad, either against France, England, or the vnited Prouinces, at
the Indies, or at Sea; all which actions are either related here, or in their distinct
Histories.</p>
   <p>I must aduertise the Reader, that, from the yeare 1530, I haue not directly
followed my Author, for I haue both inserted diuers things out of other Authors,
whereof he makes no mention, and haue related some more at large then he hath
done, for your better satisfaction, as I haue found them written in other approued
Authors. My last suit must be for my selfe and the Printer, yet will I not vse any
great circumstances to captiuate your fauors in mine owne behalfe: my stile (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse)
is plaine and harsh; it were folly (nay madnesse) in me to seeke to conceale
it, being so well knowne vnto you: yet let me intreat so much fauor at your hands,
that as I haue spent my spirits to giue you content, so you will spare your spleenes,
and censure fauorably, vntill you come to the like tryall: then shall you find, that
either by your owne mistaking, or by the errors of the Presse you shall haue iust
cause to sue for the like grace; which is, to supply all escapes and errors with your
iudicious reading. And so I rest</p>
