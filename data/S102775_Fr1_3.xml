      <pb facs="5"/>furthe to posteritie. Those I saie haue I sought out, gathered together, and acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the ordre of the storie and tyme, digested into this litle packe. Not for the hongre of gaine, or the ticklyng desire of the peoples vaine brute, and vnskilfulle commendacion: but partly moued with the oportunitie of my laisure, &amp; the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drefull profite and pleasure, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in this kinde of studie my self, and partly that other also delightyng in sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, might with litle labour, finde easely when thei would, the somme of thynges compiled in one Booke, that thei ware wonte with tediousnes to sieke in many. And I haue shocked theim vp together, aswell those of auncience tyme, as of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeres, the lewde, aswell as the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indifferentlie, that vsyng thē as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent examples, and paternes of life, thou maiest with all thine endeuour folowe the vertuous and godlie, &amp; with asmuche warenes eschewe the vicious &amp; vngodly. Yea, that thou maiest further, my (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) learne to discerne, how men haue in these daies amended the rude simplicitie of the first worlde, frō Adam to the floud and many yeres after, when men liued
<pb facs="5"/>skateryng on the earthe, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Money, or what coignement, or Merchauntes trade: no maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaūge, but one good tourne for another. When no man claimed aught for his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueralle, but lande and water ware as cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune to al, as Ayer and Skie. Whē thei gaped not for honour, ne hunted after ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, but eche man contented with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, passed his daies in the wilde fielde, vnder the open heauen, the couerte of some shadowie Tree, or slendre houelle, with suche companion or companiōs as siemed them good, their diere babes and children aboute them. Sounde without carcke and in restfull quietnesse, eatyng the fruictes of the fielde, and the milke of the cattle, and drinking the waters of the christalline springes. First clad with the softe barcke of trees, or the faire broade leaues, &amp; in processe with rawe felle and hide, full vnworkemanly patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not then enuironed with walles, ne pente vp with rampers, and diches of deapthe, but walking at free skope emōg the wanderyng beastes of the fielde, and where the night came vpon theim, there takyng their lodgyng without feare of
<pb facs="6"/>murtherer or thief. Mery at the fulle, as without knowledge of the euilles y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> aftre ensued as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worlde waxed elder, through diuers desires, and contrarie endeuours of menne. Who in processe for the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientie of the fruictes of the earthe, (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che she tho gaue vntilled) and for default of other thynges, ganne falle at disquiete and debate emong themselues, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoied the inuasion of beastes, and menne of straunge borders, (whom by themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues thei could not repelle) gathered into companies, with commune aide to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande suche encursions and violence of wrong. And so ioynyng in confederacie, planted themselues together in a plotte, assigned their boundes, framed vp cota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, one by anothers chieque, diked in thē selues, chase officers and gouernours, and deuised lawes, that thei also emong theimselues might liue in quiete. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng a rough paterne of tounes and of Cities, that aftre ware laboured to more curious finesse.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>AND</hi> now ware thei not contented, with the commodities of the fieldes and cattle alone, but by diuers inuencions of handecraftes and sciēces, and by sondrie
<pb facs="6"/>labours of this life, thei sought how to winne. Now gan thei tattempte the sease with many deuices, to transplante their progenie, and ofspring into places vnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and to enioye the commodities of eche others countrie, by mutuall traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficque. Now came the Oxe to the yoke, the Horse to the draught, the Metalle to the stāpe, the Apparel to handsomnes, the Speache to more finesse, the Behauour of menne to a more calmenesse, the Fare more deintie, the Buildyng more gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then habitours ouer all became mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and wittier, shaking of (euen of their owne accorde) the bruteshe outrages and stearne dealinges, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shamefully mought be spoken of. Nowe refrained thei from sleayng one of another, frō eatyng of ech others flesh, from rape and open defiling of mother, sister, and daughter indifferēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fro many like abhominacions to nature and honestie. Thei now marieng reason, with strength: and pollicie, with might: where the earthe was before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen with bushes, and wooddes, stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with many noisome beastes, drouned with meares, and with marshe, vnfitte to be enhabited, waast and vnhandsome in
<pb facs="7"/>euery condicion: by wittie diligence, and labour, ridde it from encombraunce, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the roughes, digged vp trees by the rootes, dried awaie the superfluous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, brought all into leauelle, banished barreinesse, and vncouered the face of the earth, that it might fully be sene, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the champeine to tillage, the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to pasture, the valley to meadow, the hilles thei shadowed with wooddes and with Vines. Then thruste thei in cultre and share, and with wide woundes of the earthe, wan wine and corne plenteously of the grounde, that afore scarcely gaue them Akornes and Crabbes. Then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited thei more thicke, and spred them selues ouer all, and buylte euery where. Of Tounes, thei made cities, and of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Tounes. Castles vpon the rockes, and in the valleis made thei the temples of the goddes. The goldē graueled sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, thei encurbed with Marble, &amp; with trees right pleasauntlie shadowed them aboute. From them thei deriued into ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Tounes, the pure freshe waters a greate distaunce of, by conduicte of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and troughes, and suche other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyaunce. Where nature had hidden the
<pb facs="7"/>waters, out of sighte, thei sancke welles of greate deapth, to supplie their lackes. Riuers, and maigne floudes, whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with vnbrideled violence, oftymes ouerflowed the neighboured aboute, to the destruction of their cattle, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and themselues: thei restrained with bancques, and kept them in a course. And to the ende thei might not onely be vada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but passed also with drie toote, thei deuised meanes with piles of Timbre, and arches of stone, maulgre the rage of their violent streames, to grounde brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vpon them. Yea, the rockes of the sea whiche for the daungier of the accesse, thoughte themselues exempte from the dinte of their hande, when thei perceiued by experience thei ware noyous to sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, with vnspeakeable labour did thei ouerthrowe &amp; breake into gobettes. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed out hauēs on euery strond, enlarged crieques, opened rodes, and digged out her borowes, where their shippes mighte ride saulfe fro the storme. Finally thei so laboured, beautified, and perfeighted the earthe, that at this daie compared with the former naturalle forgrowen waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; it might well sieme not to be that,
<pb facs="8"/>but rather the Paradise of pleasure, out of the whiche, the first paternes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde (Adam and Eue) for the trangres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Goddes precept, ware driuen.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>MEN</hi> also inuented and founde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wittie sciences, and artes, many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drefull workes, whiche when by practise of lettres, thei had committed to bookes, and laied vp for posteritie, their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours so woundered at their wisedomes, and so reuerenced their loue and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours (whiche thei spied to be meant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and the wealth of those that shuld folow of thē) that thei thought thē not blessed enough, with the estate of men mortalle, but so aduaunced their fame, and wondered at their worthinesse, that thei wan theim the honour and name of Goddes immortall.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>THO</hi> gan the Prince of the worlde, when men so gan to delight in thadour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde, to sowe vpō the good siede, the pestilente Dernell, that as thei multiplied in nombre, so iniquitie might encrease, to disturbe and confounde this blessed state.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>FIRST,</hi> therefore when he had with all kinde of wickednes belimed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world,
<pb facs="8"/>he put into their heades, a curious sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of the highest knowledge, and suche as dependeth vpon destenie of thynges. And so practised his pageauntes, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and doubtfully attempred Respō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and voices of spirites, that after he had fettred the worlde in the trauers of his toies, and launced into their hartes a blinde supersticion, and feare: he trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it whole to a wicked worship of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goddes and Goddesses, that when he ones had wiped cleane out of mynde the knowlege and honour of one God euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng, he might practise vpon manne, some notable mischief. Then sette he vp pilgrimages to deuilles, foreshewers of thynges, that gaue aduertisemente and answere to demaundes in sondrie wise. In the Isle of Delphos one, in Euboea another, at Nasamone a thirde, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Dodonians, the famous okes, whose bowes by the blastes of the winde resounded to the eare, a maner of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifemente of deuellishe delusion. To the whiche Idolles and Images of deuelles he stirred vp men to do the honour (He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) due onely to God. As to Saturne in Italie, to Iupiter in Landie, to Iuno in
<pb facs="9"/>Samos, to Bacchus in India, &amp; at The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes: to Iris, and Ostris in Egipte: in old Troie to Vesta: aboute Tritona in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrique to Pailas, in Germanie and Fraunce to Mercurie, vnder the name of Theuthe: to Minerua at Athenes and Nimetto, to Apollo in Delphos, Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Chio, Patara, Troade and Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra. To Diane in Delos and in Srythia, to Venus in Paphos, Ciprus, Enydon, and Cithera. To Mars in Thracia, to Priapus in Lampsacho of Hellespon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, to Vulcane in Typara and Lēnos, and in diuers other places to sondrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whose remembraunce was then moste freshe in the memorie of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the benefaictes and merueilous inuencions bestowed emong them.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>AFTERVVARD,</hi> also when Iesus Christe the verie sonne of the almightie father, shewyng hymself in the fleshe of our mortalitie, was conuersaunte in the worlde, pointyng to the same, as with his Engre, the waie to immortalitie, &amp; ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse blessednesse, and bothe with woorde and example, exhorted and allured them to vprightnes of life, to the glorie of his father, sendyng his disciples and scolers
<pb facs="9"/>into the vniuersall worlde, to condemne Superstition and all errour of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with the moste healthsome woorde: to plante true Religion, and geue newe preceptes, and directions of the life, and had now set the matier in suche forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and poincte, that the Gospell beyng generally of all nacions receiued, there lacked but continuaunce to perfeicte fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie: The deuell eftesones retournyng to his naturall malice, desirous to repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse that, that constrainedly he forsooke, betrappyng again the curious conceipte of man, some he reuersed into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abuses and errours, and some with newe Heresies he so corrupted, snarled, and blynded, that it had bene muche bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre for them, neuer almoste to haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the waie of truthe, then after their entraunce, so rashely and malicioussy to haue forsaken it.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>AT</hi> this daie in Asia the lesse, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianes, Arabians, Persians, Siriās, Assirians, and Meades: in Aphrique, the Egipcians, Numidians, Libiens, and Moores. In Europe, the whole coūtrie of Grecia, Misiā, Thracia, &amp; all Turquie throwyng awaie Christe, are become the
<pb facs="10"/>folowers and worshippers of Mahomet and his erronious doctrine. The people of Scithia, whom we now cal Tartares (a greate people and wide spred) parte of them worshippe the Idolle of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Kamme, parte the Sonne, the Moone, and other Starres, and part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostles doctrine, one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. The people of Inde, &amp; Ethiope, vnder the gouernaunce of <hi>Presbiter</hi> Ihō perseauer in Christiane godlinesse, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit after a sort, muche different frō ours.</p>
   <p>The sincere and true faithe of Christ, wherwith in time it pleased God to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the worlde, remaineth in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Italy, Fraunce, Spaine, Englande, Scotland, Ireland, Denmarke, Liuon, Pruse, Pole, Hungarie, and the Isles of Rhodes, Sicilie, Corsica, Sardinia, with a fewe other. This bytter ennemie of mankinde hauyng thus with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties enueiled our mindes, and disseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the christiā vniō, by diuersitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and facions of belief, hath brought to passe thorough this damnable wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of Sacrifices, and Rites, that whilest euery people (vndoubtedly with religious entent) endeuour theim selues
<pb facs="10"/>to the worshippe of God, and echeone ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpō him to be the true and best wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper of him, and whilest echone thinke theim selues to treade the streight pathe of euerlastying blessednes, and contēdeth with eigre mode and bitter dïspute, that all other erre and be ledde farre a wrie: and whilest euery man strugglethe and striueth to spread and enlarge his owne secte, and to ouerthrowe others, thei doe so hate and enuie, so persecute and annoy echone an other, that at this daie a man cannot safely trauaill from one countrie to another: yea, thei that would aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saufely or vnsaufely, be almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where holdē out. Wherof me thinkes I see it is like to come to passe, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest one people scant knoweth the name of another, (and yet almost neighbours) all that shall this daie be written or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of theim, shalbe compted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused as lyes. And yeat this maner of knowledge and experience, is of it self so pleasant, so profitable &amp; so praise worthy, that sundrie (as it is wel knowen) for the onely loue and desire thereof, leauyng their natiue countrie, their father, their mother, their wiues and their children,
<pb facs="11"/>yea, throwyng at their heles their sauf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and welfare, haue with greate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, vexations, and turmoilynges taken vpon theim for experience sake, to cutte through the wallowyng seas, and many thousande miles, to estraunge theimsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues fro their home. yea, and those men not in this age alone, but euen from the firste hatchyng of the worlde haue been reputed and founde, of moste wisedome, authoritie, and good facion, sonest chosen with all mennes consent, bothe in peace &amp; warre, to administre the cōmune wealth as maisters and counsaillours, Iudges and Capicaines. Suche ware thancient sages of Grece and of Italy, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Antisthenes, Aristippus Zeno, &amp; Pythagoras, who through their wisedomes and estimacion for trauailes wan them greate nombres of folowers, and brought furthe in ordre the sectes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Socratici, Academici, Peripateci, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici, Cyrenaici, Stoici,</hi> and <hi>Pythagorici,</hi> echone chosyng name to glorie in his maister.

To the vnlucky sailer V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisses, and to the banished Eneas, to Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Xerxes, and Alexander the Greate, to Hanniballe and Mithridate, kyng of Pontus, reported able to speake fiftie sō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie languages, to Antiochus, the greate and innumerable Princes of Roome, bothe of the Scripioes, Marij, and Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli.

Wherefore, seyng there is in the knowledge of peoples, &amp; of their maners and facions, so greate pleasure and profite, and euery man cannot, yea, fewe men will, go traueile the countries themselues: me thinkes gentill reader, thou oughtest with muche thanke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue at my hande these bookes of the maners and facions of peoples most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and famous, togyther with the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whiche thei enhabite: And with no lesse cherefulnes to embrase theim, then if beyng ledde on my hande from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to countrey, I should poynct the at eye, how euery people liueth, and where they haue dwelte, and at this daye doe.
