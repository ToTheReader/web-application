   <head>TO THE REVEREND and Right Worshipfull <hi>M. Doctor Boys, Deane of Christ-Church in Canterbury, all prosperity</hi> and happinesse in the LORD.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Sir:</hi> Albeit I am conscious to my selfe of my inability to answer the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion your loue long since hath conceiued of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in me for improuements of a Scholler: yet cannot <hi>Salomons</hi> word, being represented now to my thought <hi>(Stultus reputabitur sapiens si ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuerit)</hi> dishearten me from imparting such of my meditations vnto you, as some of them a good while since, and some more lately I had written downe, to satisfie (if I might) some scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<pb facs="3"/>consciences, touching the lawfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient vse of the gesture of Kneeling in the Acte of receiuing the holy Eucharist. About the signe of the Crosse in or after the other Sacrament, I had filled many sheetes of paper, before I could reade much of the more accurate writings of other men in that argument, and being loth according to the old Adage, to make that all onely my Cipresse tree: I vndertook vpon earnest request of a friend (more profitable I hope to the Church in his labours, then I can be) to shew the vanity of one who gloriously boasts in print, to make proofe; that the controuerted ceremonies are defended by no other arguments, then are vsed by Papists, and which by elder Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants haue bene long since answered. Betweene his second (though <hi>Senior Ignoto</hi> to me) and my selfe, the same was drawne so oft in writing <hi>con</hi> and <hi>pro,</hi> that yet I am not ashamed to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any vpon what termes I left him. Then an occasion was offered mee to answer some <hi>Quaeres</hi> about kneeling, and afterwardes more closely to ioyne issue for repelling all the Obiections which I haue obserued in reading, and which for the most part haue bin vrged in conferring with mee. My
<pb facs="3"/>arguments and answers such as they be, I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that I can get no reply to them: yet I doe not perceiue, that any one formerly opposite is willing to yeeld himselfe perswaded by them. And for this cause partly I present &amp; submit them to your reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend censure, whether contempt, or some more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wermeetest to be set against them. Partly, for that I am slow in extemporary speech, and so as is nothing likely to purchase an opinion of more iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or vnderstanding in me: therefore I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let my pen run as you see, then inter <hi>Vocales et reales amicos,</hi> to be still <hi>realiter a mute.</hi> I gratulate vnfeinedly your dignity, and no lesse the comfort of your owne soule, and esteeme in Gods Church, by your learned and godly labours publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: my desire is to adhere to you still in all serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of loue, and that with ingenuity: neither soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing nor expecting any thing else, but your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and encouragements, as formerly you haue vouchsafed me. The God of heauen grant vnto you many comfortable yeares to help to support his truth with <hi>Sions</hi> peace, and them that stand for both. So I rest. <hi>Ian. 1. 1619.</hi>
