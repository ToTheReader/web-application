   <head>THE PREFACE
To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an observation as
true as antient, that
such workes of God as
are done immediatly by
himselfe alone, though
for their excellent greatnesse farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
not onely mans apprehension, but
even admiration it selfe, yet are done by
him without any rubbe or difficulty at
all. Such was that glorious and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
worke of Creation. But such
workes as God doth by instrumentall
meanes, as by man, the greater they be,
the greater difficulties they are attended
with, and meet with many impediments.
And this is most seene in great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall


<pb facs="3"/>
Reformations of Churches or
States. Even Christ himselfe, The
<hi>onely Potentate,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts 15. 16.</note> the <hi>Mighty God,</hi>
when hee came to restore and re-erect
the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> which was
fallen downe, to wit, his spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Church, what opposition did hee
meet withall? what sweat did it cost him,
before hee could finish this glorious and
wondrous worke? In which respect the
Antients were wont to say, That God
with his word alone created the world;
but it cost the life of his onely begotten
sonne to redeeme the world for this was
opposed by Devills and men. And so it
was with the type of Redemption, Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels
deliverance from Egypt, where
Gods mighty wonders and plagues upon
Egypt, found a proud and hard hearted
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> with his blinde Egyptians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
resisting to the very last. So in
the reparation of the Temple in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
there wanted not most malignant
spirits,<note place="margin">Ezra 5. 6.</note> envious men, is <hi>Tatnai, Shether
Boznai,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Nehem. 4.</note>
      <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> who


<pb facs="3"/>
mocked and accused the Iewes to the
King, and by force sought to hinder the
worke. And therefore can wee wonder,
when in the proceeding of so great a
worke of reformation as we see begun in
our dayes (nothing inferior (all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
considered) to that deliverance
from Egypt, or to the restauration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
after Babylons captivity) difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and impediments both great and
many have and doe interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
which when wee see wee should
not be discouraged;<note place="margin">Cum reflavit affligimur. <hi>Cic.</hi>
      </note> for discouragement
in such cases is an argument and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of a mind too much relying upon
outward meanes, which while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
they are as a good gale filling the
sayles of our hope to attaine the wished
Port. But when an adverse winde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
but to whistle a little up, we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and are ready to cast away our
hope, being left as a ship without an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
floating, and without a rudder dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with every winde, ready to bee split
on every rocke or shelfe. But in such a


<pb facs="4"/>
case, we must, as in the first place look up
unto God the great master of the winds,
yea and mover of the mindes of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men: So herein behold and observe
the beaten wayes of the Lord, how hee is
pleased in all such great works to suffer
himselfe and his people to bee opposed.
And this he doth for speciall reasons, as
to shew forth the deepe wisdome of his
providence, in circumventing his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
to crosse and thwart them even
in those great and good workes which
himselfe will have to be done, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
purposeth to accomplish, &amp; which
he calleth them unto, and commandeth
them to doe, that so he may take them off
from trusting in the outward meanes,
though never so faire, and might teach
them still and stedfastly to trust in his
helpe, in his strength, in his faithfulnes,
and not to cease to call upon him and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend
on his promise, who will certainely
save, and fully answer the prayers of his
people, and in the happy issue of the work,
that his glory may in all shine forth the


<pb facs="4"/>
more clearely, when nothing shall be left
in man to glory in, but that we may
give all the honour and praise of the
worke to him alone.</p>
   <p>Againe, in all such great workes of
generall Reformation, especially of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the difficulties prove to be the
greater, by how much the vices and
corruptions to be purged out (as we see
in naturall bodies) are and have been of
longer continuance, and such also as
have received strength (under pretence
at least) even from the Lawes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by universall consent of the
whole State. Nor only this, but there is
also in our natures a kinde of Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
against that purity and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which ought to be the maine end
that all true Reformations should aime
at. And besides all this, although the
corruptions be so grosse, and of so high a
nature, as they proclaime themselves
intollerable grievances, no longer to bee
borne, but doe by a kinde of necessity
presse to a Reformation: yet there


<pb facs="5"/>
stands so great a gulfe in the way, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be removed, or so made up, as to be
made passable, it will be found no easie
matter to compasse so great a worke.
Now this gulfe is ignorance, and that
of a long standing, contracted partly
through a generall security and sloth,
and partly through the want of meanes,
while through the subtilty of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and cowardise of their inferiors,
the Light hath been put under a Bushel.
So as though the sense of our Aegyptian
burthens hath at length let us see in a
great measure our misery, yea, and
though God in his great mercy hath put
into our hands such an opportunity of
Reformation, even armed with a kinde
of necessity to worke it: Yet how unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
are many men of the manner and
measure of this Reformation, and what
God requires at our hands herein? Yet
can we not be otherwise perswaded, but
that all good men would joyne together,
quickly to goe through with this great
worke, did they but apprehend it to bee


<pb facs="5"/>
as well a matter of Conscience, as of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
For which cause, I have in
these straits of time, thought it one part
of my duty which I owe unto Christ, and
to his Church, to propound, and briefly
to resolve (as God hath enabled me)
some important Cases of Conscience,
which (hoping they may conduce to the
furthering of the great businesse now in
agitation concerning Religion) I have
adventured most humbly to recommend
unto the serious consideration of this
most just, sage and grave Senate, as to
which not only I, but all the people of
the Land doe owe our best service, and
for whose happy successe of all their
grave Counsels, we are all bound daily,
and that in a more than ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to solicite (as we still doe) the throne
of Grace, that the Spirit of Christ may
be abundantly poured forth upon this
most Noble Assembly, in all wisdome,
and understanding, and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
zeale, courage, constancy, unity,
unamity in the love of the Truth, that


<pb facs="6"/>
such a perfect Reformation may be
wrought as Christ at this time calleth
for, as his word appointeth, as all Gods
people every where thirst after, and as
the whole Antichristian faction is afraid
of, that so, when Christ alone shall be set
upon his Throne over our soules, to rule
us according to his word, and to dwell
among us by his Spirit, the Kings throne
may be for ever established in justice
and judgement, and Gods people in this
Land may enjoy both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace unto the day of Christ, and
so our posterity after us may blesse God,
and for ever call this Parliament, <hi>The
blessed Parliament.</hi>
