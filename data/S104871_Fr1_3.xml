The greatist nombre come and ever came and folowed even Christ hym se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lfe for a worldly purpose. As thou mayst well se (Iohn. vj.) how that allmost fyve th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousand folowed Christ ād wolde also have made hym a kynge / because he had well fed them.

Yet the people for the most parte receaved it not They were ever ready to ryse and to fyght. For ever when the scribes &amp; phareses went aboute to take Christ they were afrayd of the people.
