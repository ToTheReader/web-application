   <head>¶ To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THe vse of Chronologicall Tables is needfull to all Histories, that reach to anie length of time; and most of all, to those that are most generall: since they cannot, like Annales, yearely set downe all Occurrences not cohoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. This heere following, may serue as an Index to the present Part of this Worke; pointing vnto the seuer all matters, that hauing fallen out at one time, are farre disioyned in the Relation. Certainely it is not perfect: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> doe I thinke, that anie can be. For howsoeuer the yeares of the first Patriarchs may seeme to haue beene well-neere compleat, yet in the raignes of the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> wee finde manie fractions, and the last yeare, or yeares, of one King reckc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also as the formost of another. The same is most likely to haue fallen out in manie other; though not so precisely recorded. Hereto may be added the diuerse and imperfect formes of the yeare, which were in vse among sundrie Nations: causing the<note n="*" place="margin">See Lib. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

         </gap>. Chap. 3. §. 6.</note> Summer Moneths, in processe of some Ages, to fall into the Winter; and so breeding extreme confusion in the reckoning of their times. Neither is it a small part of trouble, to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, in excuse of such error as a more intentiue and perfect Calculator shall happen to finde herein. It may serue to free the Booke, and likewise the Reader (if but of meane iudgement) from anie notorious <hi>Anachronicisme;</hi> which ought to suffice. The Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will need it, euen in that regard; not onely for some errors of the Presse, in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of yeares, but for some hastie mis-reckonings of mine owne; which I desire to haue hereby reformed, in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> that the printing of this Table shall not want carefull diligence. The Reader, if he be not offended with the rest, shall finde reason to be pleased with this, as tending wholly to his owne ease.</p>
   <p>The Titles ouer the Columnes, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> reference to that which followes vnder them; as will readily be conceiued. Where two Titles, or more, are ouer the head, as<note place="inline">Rome Nabonassar</note>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> there doe the numbers vnderneath answere proportionably, the higher to the higher, the lower to the lower. For example: The walls of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were finished in the 319. yeare from the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the 314. from <hi>NABONASSAR.</hi> In like manner it is to be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, That <hi>IEHOSOPHAT</hi> began his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap> in the 3774. of the <hi>IVLIAN</hi> Aera, in the 3092. of the World, and in the 99. yeare os the Temple. This needes not more illustration; nor indeede so much, to those that are acquainted with workes of this kinde. To auoid prolixitie, I haue forborne to insert those yeares, which I finde not signed with some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> accident: as with the birth or death of some Patriarch; the beginning of some Kings Raigne; some change of Gouernment; some Battaile fought; or the like. So, of the 13. yeares wherein <hi>SYLVIVS CAPETVS</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> raigned ouer the <hi>Latines,</hi> I note onely the first; that is, omitting <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> betweene the 4. of <hi>IEHOSOPHAT,</hi> wherein <hi>CAPETVS</hi> began, vnto the 17, wherein <hi>SYLVIVS A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTINVS</hi> succeeded, and wherein <hi>IEHORAM</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> st raigned with <hi>IEHOSOPHAT</hi> his father. For I thouht it vaine to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> 2. 3. 4. 5. and so still onwards, till I had come to the first of <hi>AVENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS,</hi> and 17. of <hi>IEHOSOPHAT.</hi> In setting downe the Kings, there is noted ouer the head of euerie one, what place he held in order of Succession; as whether he were the first, second, fift, seuenth, or so forth, in ranke, of those that raigned in his Countrey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notable interruption: Before the name is the first yeare of his raigne; at the end, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of the name (as the space giues leaue) is the whole number of yeares in which he raigned; in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the spaces following <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> are those yeares of his, which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> concurrent with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of some other King, or with the yeare of anie remarkable accident. Where two numbers, or more, are found before one Kings name, there is it to be vnderstood, that the same yeare belonged, not onely to the King then beginning, but vnto some one, or more, of
<pb facs="781"/>
his fore-goers: as the first yeare of <hi>IEHORAM</hi> King of <hi>Isracl</hi> was the same with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his brother <hi>AHAZIA,</hi> and the 22. of his father <hi>AHAB.</hi> So, where two or three names are found in one space; as in the 3077. yeare of the World, <hi>ZIMRI, TIBNI,</hi> and <hi>OMRI:</hi> it is meant, that euerie one of them raigned in some part of the same yeare; which is reckoned the second of <hi>ELA,</hi> and the first of <hi>OMRI.</hi> Particularly, vnder the yeares of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings are set downe the yeares of those <hi>DYNASTIES,</hi> which it was thought meet to insert; as likewise, otherwhiles, the day of the moneth vpon which <hi>NABONASSARS</hi> yeare began: which, how it varied from other yeares, may be found in the place last aboue cited.</p>
   <p>Concerning the <hi>Aera,</hi> or accompt of yeres, from <hi>IPHITVS,</hi> who began the <hi>Olympiads,</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> from <hi>Rome</hi> built, from <hi>NABONASSAR,</hi> and the like; as much as was thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hath beene said, where due place was, in the Booke it selfe: so as it remaineth onely to note, that vnder the title of <hi>Olympiads</hi> is set downe first the number of the <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and beneath it, the yeare of that <hi>Olympiad:</hi> as that <hi>CYRVS</hi> began his raigne in <hi>Persia,</hi> in the 55. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the first yeare thereof.</p>
   <p>Now, for that the yeares of the World, of the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>NABONAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR,</hi> and other, had not beginning in one month, but some of them in March, some in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, some about Midsummer, and some at other times: the better to expresse their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> beginnings, some painefull Chronologers haue diuided them proportionably in their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Columnes; opposing part of the one yeare to part of the other: not (as I haue here done) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> cutting all ouer thwart with one streight line, as if all had begun and ended at one time. But this labour haue I spared, as more troublesome than vsefull; since the more part would not haue apprehended the meaning, and since the learned might well be without it. It will onely be needfull to obserue, that howsoeuer the <hi>Aera</hi> of the <hi>Olympiads</hi> be 24. yeares elder than that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and 29, than that of <hi>NABONASSAR,</hi> yet the raigne of some King may haue begun at such a time of the yeare as did not sute with this difference. But hereof I take little regard. The more curious will easily finde my meaning: the vulgar will not finde the difficultie. One familiar example may explane all. Queene <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> began her raigne the 17. of Nouember, in the yeare of our <hi>LORD</hi> 1558: Shee was crowned; held a Parliament; brake it vp; threw downe Images; and reformed manie things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all in her first yeare: yet not all in that yeare 1558, but the greater part in the yeare following; whether we begin with the first of Ianuarie, or with the 25. of March. The like may be otherwhiles found in this Table; but so, as the difference is neuer of a whole yeare.</p>
   <p>The <hi>IVLIAN</hi> Period, which I haue placed, as the greater number, ouer the yeares of the World, was deuised by that honorable and excellently learned <hi>IOSEPH SCALIGER:</hi> being accommodated to the <hi>IVLIAN</hi> yeares, now in vse among vs. It consisteth of 7980 yeares; which result from the multiplication of 19. 28. and 15, that is, of the Cycle of the Moone, the Cycle of the Sunne, and the yeares of an Indiction. Being diuided by anie of these, it leaues the number of the present yeare; or if no fraction remaine, it shewes the last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> yeare of that Cycle to be current. For example: in the 4498. of this Period, when was fought the great battaile of <hi>Cannae,</hi> the Prime or Golden number was 14, the Cycle of the Sunne 18, and consequently the Dominicall letter <hi>F.</hi> as may be found by diuiding the same number of the <hi>IVLIAN</hi> Period 4498, by 19. for the Prime, by 28. for the Cycle of the Sunne. This <hi>IVLIAN</hi> Perioà, after the present accompt, alwayes exceedes the yeares of the World by 682. Besides the former vses, and other thence redounding, it is a better Character of a yeare, than anie other <hi>Aera</hi> (as <hi>From the beginning of the World, From the Floud, From</hi> Troy <hi>taken,</hi> or the like) which are of more vncertaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
   <p>More I shall not need to write, as touching the vse or explication of these Tables. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> was thus much requisite to such as are conuersant in workes of this kinde: it sufficeth if hereby all be made plaine enough to the vulgar.</p>
