   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing we are all bound, in the dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a common iust cause, euen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend those who are strangers to vs; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seeme vnfit to any, if we affoord thē so much fauour, whose persons, and deserts are verie well knowne. There is no better contentment for our labour past, then in the assurance from our conscience, that it is well imployed: for doubtlesse the spurning at vertue, giueth a greater stroke to the doer, then to him that suffereth; &amp; yet euen that religion, that cōmandeth patience, forbiddeth not the iust defence of our selues in a good cause; especially then, when by wronging a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, there may be some hazard of the truth it selfe. Our Church hath had some enemies, more openly discontent in the case of Discipline, then they now appeare; whom to satisfie with reason, Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> indeuoured with much paines; that which might haue contented all, was in diuers, a spurre to a more violent choler: for medicines how profitable soeuer, worke not equally in all humours. From hence proceeded a desire in some, to make question of things, whereof there was no doubt, and a request for resolution, of some points, where in there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: to this end a Letter (which heere is answered) was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by certaine Protestants (as they tearme themselues) which I heare (how true I know not) is translated into other tongues; this they presume hath giuen that wound, to that reuerend and learned man, that it was not the least cause to procure his death. But it is farre otherwise; for he contemned it in his wisdome (as it was fit) and yet in his humilitie would haue answered it, if he had liued. Surely for mine owne part, I neuer thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb facs="4"/>
that the grauity of this present businesse, and the reuerend worthinesse of him that is accused, should not be answered with grauitie both of person and speech; and my witnesses are both in heauen and earth, how iustly I can excuse my selfe, as <hi>Elihu</hi> did: <hi>Behold, I did wait vpon the word of the ancient, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened for their knowledge:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 32.</note>
      <hi>I stayed the time,</hi> and a long time, vntill some elder and of viper iudgement, might haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me from all opinion of presumption in this cause; which being not done by thē, whom many reasons might haue induced to this Defence, I could not for that part which I beare in that Church, whose gouernment was defended by Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> with patience endure so weake a Letter anie longer to remaine vnanswered. And herein I haue dealt as with men (although to me vnknown) of some learning and grauitie, to whom peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in manie respects I am farre inferiour; and yet for anie thing that I know, or appeareth in this Letter, they may bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the same infirmities that I am. But if this had beene by himselfe performed (which I heare he hath done, and I desire thee to expect it) thy satisfaction (gentle Reader) would haue beene much more, yet vouchsafe in thy kindnesse, to accept this.</p>
