   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He farre traueller by Sea, vseth his Carde and Instruments, &amp; all his indeuoure, to finde out the course of a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous voiage. Wherein, the vncertaintie of the thing hee seeketh, causeth him often to faile his purpose. But in this course which I direct, the Reader shall not haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aduenture any such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, albeit the matter sought, be as precious, as whatsoeuer. Reason, which euerie man
<pb facs="5"/>should lodge in his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, is it which I aduise to be enquired; whereof, as men, by their originall natures doo participate, so ought they, by their reasonable Discretions, gouerne the whole course of their liues. Her excellencie can not in wordes bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which causeth her rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bee so slenderly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: Reason is in the son of God, perfect, pure, &amp; true: But in men, corrupted: what is there that she doeth not in some measure search into? Her viewe pearceth into the
<pb facs="5"/>earth, and all the Elements. The powers of heauen and Angels, into all things that may be comprehended with vnderstanding; And farther, euen into things that are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, &amp; aboue the compasse of her selfe: For though shee cannot reach into the depth of eternitie, and the sauing of soules: yet she bringeth to the knowledge of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in his mercies (whereby this saluation is wrought) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mysterie farre aboue the capacitie of men. Whatsoeuer concerneth vs, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb facs="6"/>of this present world, or otherwise, Reason sheweth, that it was possible to Gods power, agreeable to his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and mercie, answerable to his will and promises, and beseeming his glory, behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to manifest our basenesse, &amp; necessarie for our welfare. By her powerfull argument, she is able to put vngodlines it selfe to silence; wherupon it is fitly concluded, that credit is not to be giuen to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward person, but to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine thing within the person: whereby is meant, Reason,
<pb facs="6"/>whose originall purenes, is in some measure hereafter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
   <p>That this right Reason is corrupted in men, none can doubt, if they behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues truely what they are, in respect of what they should be. Wherfore, if Salomon therby found out the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his life, and hath not spared to leaue to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view of the worlde, his errors manifested, and the striuing hee had to reforme the same, no man hath Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be ashamed, secretly,
<pb facs="7"/>and priuately, in the closet of his owne hart, to view his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions and slidings from reason; and indeuor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of his actions to the rule and order of Reason. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of these things, I haue rather bent my selfe, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Reader out of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the learned, &amp; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son her selfe, then vpon any i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations of mine owne. I pray thee therefore take in good part my labor, &amp; good will, &amp; giue the subiect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I intreate, thy furtherance, howsoeuer thou mayest bee
<pb facs="7"/>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the maner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And let me desire (as Iustus Lipsius in his booke of Constancie) that thou wilt reade twise before thou once censure it; and I shall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for thy paines, and wish part of all Gods good blessings towards thee. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
