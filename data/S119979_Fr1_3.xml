   <head>To the Faithfull people of diuers nations, gathered together, <hi>and making profession of the Gospel, in the</hi> French Church at <hi>London:</hi> grace, and peace, <hi>through our Lorde Iesus</hi> Christe.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He kingdome of heauen (as saith our Lord Iesus Christ) is like vnto a pearle of great price, which when one hath found, he doubteth not to sel al that he hath, to buy the same. And in deede, if the heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be the soule of the Church, let men take away the knowledge of the Gospel, and then it shalbe nothing else, but a dead corps or carion of the world. If it be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible seede of life, let it haue no word, and then the Church will remaine a feelde altogether barren. Let men once put out this light, and we shal abide in the middest of deadly darkenesses. To be shorte, if we suffer this scepter and throne of our God to fall downe, the prince of lying will not faile to set vp his tyrannie in steede thereof. And yet notwithstanding, O how great is the vanitie of the worlde? O howe detestable is mens vnthankefulnes? God hath now of late set before vs this same excellent pearle, yea so that we might buy it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out siluer but it is for the most part troden vnder the feete of hogges and swine. God hath as it were newly breathed this vital spirit into his church, but ignorance doeth alreadie lift vp it selfe, to take it by the throte. He hath sent abroad his sowers with aboundance of seede, but it is for the most part choaked vp by the cares of this
<pb facs="9"/> worlde. The pure and cleare light of truth,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.22.</note> hath bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine kindled and lighted in our presence, but the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will not comprehend and conceiue the same:<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.5.</note> and this same honorable gouernment of the great king, hath beene established and set vp amongest vs, but wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together, and set open a breach vnto the enemie, to inuade againe by little and little the possession therof. And seeing we wonder at this,<note place="margin">Ioel 2.28. Act. 2.17.</note> that God hauing spread abroade his spirite vpon all flesh, euen so farre as that wee haue seene sonnes and daughters, young folkes and olde, learned and vnlearned prophecie, and that we nowe see the sunne turned into darknesse, and the Moone into bloud, should it not teache vs care and conscience? Wee reade with horror and feare (and that vpon good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) of the ignorance, vnthankefulnesse, malice, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate rebellion of the people of the Iewes, and withall we iustifie the Lord in those iudgementes, which he hath exercised and executed vpon them. But do we not feare, as the wicked seruaunts doe, that we shall be iudged by our owne mouth and saying?<note place="margin">Luke. 19.22.</note> For these thinges (saide S. Paul) are written for our instruction and learning:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.11. Heb. 12.25.</note> and if those escaped not, which despised him that spake on the earth, we shal be much more punished, if we despise him that speaketh from heauen. And in deede we haue not neede onely to feare pestilences, famines, warres, ruines, and desolations, by which it seemeth that God wil vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consume our generation, and ofspring, as he did them of the Israelites in the wildernes, but also other plagues, yet much more seuere &amp; sharp, which God kepeth shut vp in the treasures of his iudgmēt, &amp; by which he threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teneth to punish the contēpt of his word. Verily, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Isay reprouing the people of his time saith, that they
<pb facs="10"/> were, as wicked and disorderous children, which profite no whit at all in going to schoole,<note place="margin">Isay. 28.10.</note> although the Maister giue them commandement vpon commaundement, and one rule vpon an other. And therfore he declareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that God will speake vnto them, in a stamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tongue, and in a strange language, whereof they shall vnderstand nothing, no no more then if Gods word were vnto them a sealed booke,<note place="margin">Isay. 29.11.</note> or then if they had not eyes to be able to reade it. What more? S. Paul addeth that God will giue Sathan the strength of illusion &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.11.</note> to the end that they which would not receiue the truth, might obey lying, which is the most fearful venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, that we can imagine or thinke off: which also notwithstanding we see swiftly already to set vp it selfe, yea to be exercised and executed in diuers quarters. What then?<note place="margin">We muste be diligent in the hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of Gods worde Care of poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</note> What remaineth for vs to do, but this, that we stir vp that our first heate, and be attentiue in the hearing, reading, and meditating of gods word, that so we may communicate and leaue this goodly treasure, as a perpetuall inheritance, to our posteritie: of which if we haue any care at all, it is in this respect, that we ought chiefy to shew it. For God hath appointed vs to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful keepers of his graces, to the end we may communicate them, as it were from hand to hand, to those that shall come after vs. Thus saith the Lorde: Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do?<note place="margin">Gene. 18.17.</note> For I know, that hee will commaund his house, and his children after him to walke in the wayes of the Lord. And if fathers in the olde time were commaunded to cause their children diligently to vnderstand the deliuerances of the people out of Egypt &amp; Babylon:<note place="margin">Exod. 12.26. Psal. 78.5, 6. &amp;c.</note> how much more ought we to labour, both that the grace of Iesus Christ might not in our time be
<pb facs="10"/> darkened, and also that our race and stocke might after vs enioy so excellent a benefite? And to this end is it, that besides sundrie holy exercises practised amongst vs, we haue drawne back againe into vse, and that with some profite (vnlesse I be deceiued) that which was obserued in the olde Church: to wit,<note place="margin">Catechising olde and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note> that the children which are nourished and brought vp, in the middest of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should, before they be receiued to the supper, present themselues to the pastour, in the holie assemblie, to the end they might yelde a reason of their faith, and so be commended to God by publike prayers, and confirmed in the profession of godlinesse. This is then the duetie of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, diligently to trauel,<note place="margin">Parents dutie</note> as wel in their owne persons, as by the labour and helpe of schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that their children may be instructed and taught. And to the Children,<note place="margin">Childrens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> who are the heires of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and of the couenant, it appertaineth carefully to get and keepe this knowledge of saluation, as an assured foundation of their whole life, and all the workes they shal do. Wherein,<note place="margin">A faithfull &amp; carefull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour.</note> to the end I might more and more helpe you, <hi>I</hi> haue drawne this forme of instruction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it in such sort to the vse of children, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Masters of housholdes, instructing their little ones therein, may also themselues profite by the same, if it were no other ways but in refreshing their memories, with thinges which they haue learned before. I haue in the same also quoated the places of scripture, which is the onely rule, both of that which we ought to beleeue, and also of that which we ought to doe: to the end that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may in good time learne to beleeue with the heart, that which they shall confesse with the mouth, &amp; that they may be according to the doctrine of Saint Peter,
<pb facs="11"/> prepared to yeeld to all men a reason of their faith, by the worde of God.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.15.</note> Now I beseech this great God and Father, to inriche vs more and more with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his knowledge, which we may holde closed vp and kept fast within the cheste of a good conscience, to the end that he which hath reuealed the sonne of perdition,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.8.</note> may wholy abolish him by the comming of his sonne, and tread down Satan vnder our feete,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> to the glorie of his owne name. So be it.</p>
