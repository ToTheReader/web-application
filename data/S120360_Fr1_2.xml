   <head>THE CONTENTS OF THE seuerall parts of this Treatise.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first part (besides a briefe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō of the priuate spirit first prefixed therto) it is disputed <hi>Categoricè,</hi> and absolutly, that the Scripture is not the Iudge of Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies. And this euicted from the difficulty of the Scripture, in regard of its Subiect, seueral sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and phraze of the stile; as also from Reason, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Fathers, Doctrine of Traditions &amp;c.</p>
   <p>In the second Part it is disputed <hi>Hypotheticè,</hi> that supposing for the time, that the Scripture (as it is simply cōsidered in it self) were the iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies; yet it is proued, that of all the different kynds of Sectaries, that euer were, the Protestants can with the least reason insist in it, as Iudge. And this is made euident by three seuerall wayes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>First,</hi> because the Protestants cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, what Bookes are true Scripture, and consequently do not agree in assigning, which bookes doe concurre to the making vp of this Iudge;
<pb facs="3"/>
some allotting more bookes to it, some fewer; and so they make it of greater or lesser extent, then (euen according to their seuerall opinions) it should be.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly,</hi> because euen of those Bookes, which the Protestants ioyntly imbrace for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, there is not (in their iudgments) any one entire true Original, either Hebrew or Greeke now to be found, neither are there any traslatiōs of them now extant, but such as are (by the Ptotestāts assertions) false, corrupt, and impure: And so by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding the Scripture for Iudge, they obtrude (at least by their owne Doctrine) a false, corrupt, and impure Iudge.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thirdly,</hi> &amp; lastly, because euen of those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bookes only, or parts of Canonicall Scripture, whose Originalls in them yet extant are true, and whose translations in those passages are admitted by the Protestants for true and vncorrupted, the texts and testimonies do make against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and in behalfe of the Catholike Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if we insist either in the perspicuity of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words, or in the iudgment of the auncient Fathers interpreting the said texts, or finally in the implicit &amp; tacit censure &amp; acknowledgment of the Protestants thēselues. And thus the Protestants by appealing to Scripture, do wound themselues.</p>
