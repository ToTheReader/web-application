   <head>The Preface to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat many sollid and urgent reasons did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, who among the liberall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines which without controversie are very profitable to mans life, doe give the first place to the noble Art of <hi>Geographie,</hi> they shall best know and discerne, who shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider both the excellencie, and pleasure, as also the incredible profit of this Art. For, as concerning the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and excellencie thereof, it doth not intreate of meane matters of small moment, as brute <hi>beasts,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> pretious <hi>stones, mettalls,</hi> and other workes of nature, the handling whereof no reasonable man will contemne; but it presenteth to our sight the whole Globe of the Earth as it were in a Mirrour or Looking-glasse, and doth shew the beautie and ornaments of the whole Fabricke of the world, and containeth all things in her ample and spacious bosome, and like the vaste Sea, it doth not onely open and lay forth the hidden and remote Islands, but also all other Countries. To omit the neere affinitie which this noble Science hath with Astronomie, which mounting above the earth doth contemplate the Heavens.</p>
   <p>Moreover, if men as often as they heare some relation of this or that Country, of any strange unknowne people, or of any rare and unusuall Creature, or of the continuall burning of the Mountaine <hi>Aetna,</hi> also of divers Islands lying here and there in the great Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and also of Salvage Nations, some whereof goe naked without cloathes, others feede on mans flesh, and the like matters; or doe reade the wonderfull histories of the East and West Indies, (in which there are many things which doe rather seeme fabulous than
<pb facs="5"/>
true) doe apprehend them with such great admiration, and give such earnest attention thereunto, out of the desire which they have to heare such novelties; how much more may the curious Readers delight in this worke, which, as we said before, doth containe and represent the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the Countries, Kingdomes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Woods, Mountaines, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, People, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and innumerable Townes thereof, with the Seas flowing about it: all which any one may here view on dry land, without endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his body or goods; and in this travell his friends shall not be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous or take care for him in his absence, or earnestly desire his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Besides, in this peregrination or travell he shall want no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that may drive away the tediousnesse of the journey; for while he fixeth his eyes on severall Countries and places, he shall straight way behold the speciall gifts and peculiar excellencie of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and observe a wonderfull variety therein, which are very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the mind, for as the Proverbe saith, A good merry companion is as a Coach upon the way.</p>
   <p>But they shall chiefely discerne the great and manifold benefits of this Art of Geography, who in their eye-travell, and viewing of severall Countryes, shall consider the scituation and disposition of Countries; the Customes, observations, lawes, and manners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and shall afterwards traffique, and send commodities to severall places, or resolve to study the liberall Arts; seeing no Poet, nor Historian can be well read with profit, nor be conveniently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or declared by any Interpreter or Commentator, without the helpe and knowledge of this most Noble Science. I omit here to mention how absurd and unfit it is, that he who hath no skill nor knowledge in these matters, should give his opinion and judgement in the publicke assembly or councell of the Common-wealth, when consultation is held about the discovery of some unknowne Country, or in time of warre concerning the bounds and confines of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
   <p>But Princes and Noble men ought chiefely to bestow great paines in studdying this most excellent Art, in regard it may be very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them in undertaking journies and voyages when occasion requireth, as also at home for fortifying the Frontiers of their owne Territories, or the directing and conducting of any warlike expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For that irrecoverable dangers have ensued when an army hath beene led through places unknowne both to the souldiers and
<pb facs="6"/>
Captaine, both <hi>Livy</hi> and many other Historiographers have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly testified by cleere and manifest examples.</p>
   <p>And moreover, as it is very necessary, profitable and pleasant to know all Countries, Kingdomes, Dominions, and Provinces, with their scituation, disposition, and qualities; so in like manner the severall Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and memorable waters thereof, ought to be considered exactly in these times, when voyages are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made, unto knowne and unknowne Countries, so that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one will continually reside at home, and abstaine from making discoveries both by Sea and Land. So that <hi>Polidore Virgils</hi> complaint is now vaine, who in the fifteenth chapter of the third Booke concerning the Invention of Matters, doth condemne mankind of too much rashnesse, and madnesse, in regard he cannot bridle his affections and desires with reason: and though God hath given him the Earth, being a firme and immovable element, abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all things necessary and convenient for mans life, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not content therewith, hath made a Scrutiny and search into the starres, the heavens, and the vaste Seas. To the same purpose <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> sung formerly, in his first Booke, and third <hi>Ode:</hi>
      <q>
         <l>He had a heart of Oake or Brasse,</l>
         <l>Who did lanch forth a brittle ship, to passe</l>
         <l>At first through the rough Seas,</l>
         <l>And did not feare, when he set forth</l>
         <l>The Affrick wind striving with the North wind, &amp;c.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And a little after in the same place:
<q>
         <l>No sort of death he sure did feare</l>
         <l>That saw the Monsters swimming there,</l>
         <l>And could behold them with drye eyes</l>
         <l>With the swelling Sea and rockes which in it lyes.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And afterward he addeth;
<q>
         <l>In vaine did God divide the land</l>
         <l>from the unsociable Seas,</l>
         <l>If impious ships can sayle unto</l>
         <l>forbidden Ports when they doe please.</l>
         <l>But mankind bold still to adventure</l>
         <l>doth on forbidden mischiefe enter &amp;c.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And hereunto <hi>Propertius</hi> in his third Booke doth allude, in that Elegie wherein he be wayleth <hi>Petus</hi> his Shipwracke, where he singeth thus:
<q>
         <pb facs="6"/>
         <l>Goe crooked shippes, of death the fatall cause,</l>
         <l>Which on himselfe man with his owne hand drawes▪</l>
         <l>Vnto the earth, wee added have the Seas,</l>
         <l>That the miseries of misfortunes may increase.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And a little after:
<q>
         <l>Nature to ensnare the covetous man,</l>
         <l>Doth let him sayle upon the Ocean.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>But these reasons are not able to discourage any one, but rather to quicken their industry, greedily to take any occasion to know, view and discover divers Countries both neerehand and remote; partly by undertaking long voyages: and those that cannot conveniently travell, may gather the knowledge of all Countries out of Bookes and exact descriptions. And truely that studdy is irreproveable, so that it ought rather to be accounted laudible, profitable, pleasant and necessary. For <hi>Strabo</hi> in the first Book of his Geography saith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that man ought to live on the Sea as well as on the land, and that God made him equally an Inhabitant and Lord thereof Therefore they deserve great praise, who have laboured in this Art, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>elius, Daniel Cellarius, Anthony Maginus, Paul Merula, Peter Bertius</hi> and others: but especially that most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mathematician <hi>Gerard Mercator,</hi> although he were preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by death, so that he could not finish his Geographicall worke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Atlas.</hi> But <hi>Iodocus Hondy</hi> did supply this defect, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not onely those Tables which were wanting to make the worke perfect, but also accurate descriptions thereof, by the labour and stud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Peter Montane.</hi> This worke we doe publish againe in this new Edition, being accurately reuised, and purged from many grosse errours; and the studious Reader shall finde that the enlargement of this Booke is not to be contemn'd, being set forth with divers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and some new Tables added, as he may see in the descriptions of <hi>England, Ireland, Spaine, Friesland, Groonland, Vltra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum,</hi> and other Countries, that shall compare this Edition with the former. Therefore Curteous Reader, enjoy these our new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, favour them, and Farewell.</p>
