      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Owler addeth vnto his fiddle whiche he calleth a Psalter, an admonition. It may (I trust) be as lawefull for me, nowe in the ende of this booke to adde a few words in way of a necessary admonition. VVhen the Pope sheweth himselfe liberal in giuinge of Pardons to them which will pray so as he appointeth them, &amp; when papists are busie to make vs Psalters and such prety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes whereon to pray, a man woulde
<pb n="107" facs="54"/> thinke that both he &amp; they were become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuoute. But euen these very same men, when this word prayer is most busie in their mouthes, haue in their hartes &amp; hands fowle &amp; bloody practises, to cut the throates of thē whom they doe allure to pray with them. In which they do not so closely work, but God of his goodnes, doth discouer thē, blessed be his name for it. He doth bevvray vnto vs that blood thrist vvhich lieth in their hartes. For, they do in dede secretly labor &amp; practise the sheding of our blood &amp; the murthering of vs all, whilest they doe allure vs to pray, as they prescribe vs. And therfore iust cause we haue novve to complaine on these enemies as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid doth vppon his:
<hi>Psal. 55. The wordes of his mouth were softer then butter, yet warre was in his hart: His words were more gentle then oyle, yet they were swords.</hi> VVe may likevvise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine as he doth, <hi>Psal. 120. My soule hath to longe dwelt with him that hateth peace. I seeke peace, &amp; when I speake thereof, they are bent to warre.</hi> In these practises of the seede of Cain, that is of these romish catholikes (for so they vvil be called) vve do se that fulfilled vvhich vvas foretold vs by our Sauior Christ. <hi>Ioh. 16. That whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doth God seruice.</hi> Thus are the childrē of God
<pb n="108" facs="55"/> forevvarned that they shall finde enemies so deuout &amp; cruell, that they shall thinke them selues to do good and acceptable sacrifice to God in slaying &amp; killing of them. This is an opinion vvhich is putte into their mindes by the deuill that old murtherer &amp; liar: &amp; in this murthering, the murtherers do this their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the deuil him selfe. The old persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge Pagans thus serued their Gods, that is, the deuill him selfe in bloody slayinges and murtheringes of Christians. In deede it is the delight of the deuil to smell the sauor of such sacrifices. And therfore euen among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Idolaters, the deuill that olde mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer hadde sovved this delusion, that they vvere induced to thinke it to be a most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable seruice to their Idolls, to offer vnto them men, vvomen, &amp; children in slaine sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice like beasts. Yea some of thē did doate herein so egregiously, that they spared not their ovvne sonnes, and daughters, but made vnnaturall slaughters of their naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the deuil him selfe in their Idols. And this vvas amonge them a thinge so common and horrible,<note place="margin">Cl. Alex.</note> that euen of this their cruell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity did some olde doctors and vvry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Christes church gather argumentes to proue those Idols false deuils and their vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
<pb n="109" facs="55"/> Idolatry, and to dravv those Idolaters from their barbarous infidelitie to the faith of Christ. The same pagans also vvere taught by the deuill their schoolemaister to thinke sometime that it vvas meete for them to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie their gods, and to procure them selues felicity by makinge of hauocke and cruell slaughters of the godly olde Christians. The same murtherer the deuill vvhich vvrought these mischiefes then, doth vse still his olde pranckes, and doth sturre vp papistes novv to practise the like inhumaine &amp; cruell slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vpon the poore flock &amp; sheepe of Christ, as he did by Pagans then. They thinke it an acceptable seruice &amp; sacrifice to their God. But it is only a pleasing seruice to the deuill of hel, and the deuill it is vvhom papistes do serue herein. They thinke by these meanes to extinguish the faith, the religion, &amp; true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ, that their popish Idols may keepe the place of God, and be counted and vvorshipped as God only and alone vppon earth, vvherein they serue the deuill himselfe to the vttermost of their povver. Many are the vnnaturall slaughters vvhich not onelie before vs, but euen in our age papistes haue made in Fraunce, at Merindoll, Paris, and through that vvhole realme, in Flaunders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="110" facs="56"/> and Spayne, England and else vvhere as the histories of our age doe beare testimony. But if that God vvhom Papists vvorship be such a cruel belly god, that he is best pleased vvhen men are slayne for his pleasure, vve may safely say then that, that vvhich the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists doe vvorshippe vvith such seruice, is the very deuill of hell. For the Lord God the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heauen and earth, God the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, the onely true liuing God, accepteth no such seruice, no such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and he vvill in his appoynted time call these butchers and men quellers to as feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an accompte for these their cruell doings as once he called Cain for the slaughter of his brother Abell. Yea let them proceede, they shall but fill vppe the measure of their sinnes, that vpon them (as Christ sayth) may come all the righteous blood that vvas shed vpon the earth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.</note> from the blood of Abell the righteous, vnto the blood of Zacharias the sonne of Barachias, &amp;c. But you vvill say these men be deuoute in their prayers. They doe pray: so did Cain: so did Doeg, make a semblance of praying and sacrificing, but this vvas but the counterfetting of these cast-avvayes. And the Papists do think that vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest they do thus nourish this vnsatiable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="111" facs="56"/> and deuise of these bloody massacres in their heartes, yet that they doe pray so vvell thēselues, that they may allure others to pray vvith them. But in these their thoughtes they do erre, and are deceaued. For the Lord him selfe sayeth by the Prophet.
<hi>Isai. 1. VVhen you shall stretch out your hands I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers, I will not heare, for your hands are full of blood.</hi> The prayers therfore of these bloody papists are not hearde, thankes be to God for it. But let vs al vvhich do professe the religion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in truth, be admonished vvith care and diligence to practise right prayer accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Iesus Christ our Sauior, and not forget that vvhilest vve do pray, papistes haue still their secrete practises to cut all our throates, and therefore let vs be prepared for them.</p>
