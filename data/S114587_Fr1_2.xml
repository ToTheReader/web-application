   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N regard of your many kindnesses, and no other meanes remaining in mee of requitall, except such as my condition alloweth: I send you this small labour of mine, being the seuerall conuersions of foure learned men, from Popish errour and blinde superstition. The fame of them hath beene farre extended, in regard of the learned handling of each dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: which, vpon consideration, I am sure good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both haue, and will confesse no lesse. I desire you to accept my good will, and burie all defects in the honestie of mine intent toward you, till better occasion may afford me a larger measure of loue on your behalfe. This should haue been accōpanied with another excellent Treatise, of a great Duchesses conuersion in the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> a learned Epistle of hers to her Lord and husband, declaring her souls high comfort in her forsaking Idolatry, and the maine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes of Popery very learnedly discouered: but wanting
<pb facs="3"/> leasure, in regard of other very serious imployments, I am enforced to let it rest till more apt opportunitie. But I hope within short time to perfect it: which (then) shall helpe to supply what wanteth in this toward you. Till when, as heretofore, so shall I still remaine your poore wel-wishing friend, any way by you to be vsed or commanded.</p>
