   <head>TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY MONARCH, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, KING OF GREAT <hi>BRJTAINE, FRANCE,</hi> AND <hi>IRELAND,</hi> DEFEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER OF THE <hi>FAITH,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are justly placed in a glorious sphere, elevated in a most conspicuous altitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other inferiour and subordinate Orbes, from whence (as a soveraign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter) you behold and judge of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they either relish of worth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, and (like the Sunne) impartially dispense the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames of your favour, as well to the humblest plant, as the tallest Cedar. As I am a recent and fresh existent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your life-tendring influence, for when depressed and trampled upon by the insolency of an unkinde-adversary
<pb facs="3"/> that raised me up to tread upon an equall Basis with him, who lately had designed me for his foot-stoole. An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of Clemency and Iustice, eminent vertues, and truely inherent in your most Royall bosome: for which with all humility I bow, and thankfulnesse acknowledge, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely honouring them so conspicuous in your Majesty, and by you so frequently exercised. Thus restor'd, I come charg'd with a Booke, which I most humbly prostrate at your feete, because I feare it is not conscious of so much worth, as to merit a kisse from your sacred hand. It is the Embrion of my study, travels, experience, and practise, and cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to forme and perfection without the reflection of your Majesties favour. It brings with it a front not altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, of <hi>Horsmanship</hi> and <hi>Ferriery;</hi> the first not incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the most illustrious title and Heroick Spirit; the second not unworthy the knowledge, yea the practise of the most accomplish'd Gentleman. I know this Treatise cannot hold proportion with so elated a patronage, as that of your Majesty, although it were inform'd with a farre nobler Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; yet for all this infinite disproportion, the Dedication of it unto your sacred Majesty will not appeare much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for first I received the ability to prosecute it from your Grace and favour: so that deriving its being from you, it belongs of right unto you, and must have recourse unto your Majestie for its safety and protection. Secondly, it is the off-spring of my age, and cannot but leave a fatall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in its Parents infirmity, and therefore (especially in these censorious times) cannot possibly subsist without your Royall protection. Lastly, as you have taken the rationall creatures of this your tripartite Kingdome into your titular care, so have you not excluded the irrationall, albeit in a different condition, much lesse the <hi>Horse,</hi> whose Generosity, and use have given him the precedency in your Majesties esteeme, before all other bruit species; so that this Booke (which beautifies his shape, encreases his courage, delivers rudiments for his menage, prescribes cures for his diseases,
<pb facs="3"/> and in all, enables and advances his race and bravery) hopes to finde your Majesties hand extended and open to receive it. The worke concernes the Common-wealth in generall, and if accepted and perused with as much zeale and care as I have us'd in the publishing of it; I presume it will not be found empty of profit. My many yeares have given me the priviledge to have seene and knowne this kingdome rich both in the number and quality of her Horses, and it would infinitely grieve me that I now live to see her reduc'd to so deplorable an indignity, but that I am confident I shall see her restor'd to her precedent glory and opulency by your Majesty: and now that I have assum'd the boldnesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate her poverty, my zeale and respect to my Country, transports me yet a little further to discover the causes of it, together with the redresses and remedies. First, those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, Parks, Commons, Fennes, Moores, and other marrish and waste grounds, which paid yearely so rich a tribute of young, able, and serviceable Horses to the universall use of this Kingdome, are at this time disafforrested, dispark't, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, drain'd, laid dry, and converted to other (but much different) uses, so that those brave breeds and races of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are much extenuated, or altogether intermitted. Then the Gelders, who in every shire so confidently and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise their faculty in a most unlawfull manner, and spay yong Fillies, by which meanes they become barren, the breeds of Horses discontinued, and the Common-wealth highly prejudic'd and unfurnish'd; for instance I can and will (upon occasion) produce a Gelder who spayes more then a hundred Fillies. For redresse of the first, your Majesty may be pleased to command that those Statutes which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted for the breeding of Horses, may be speedily and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly put in execution. For the second, that you will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise please by your Proclamation to inhibit all Gelders that unlawfull and prejudiciall exercise of their profession, then shall your Majesty see the noxious and exorbitant disease meet with a sudden and easie cure, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="4"/> derive a sensible and inestimable benefit from it. Now it rests that I make an humble Apologie for my boldnesse, which indeed would be a matter of trouble and difficulty for me to accomplish; did I not know your Majestie to be a Prince infinitely tendring the good and welfare of your Kingdome; so that this treating of a businesse not inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I despaire not of obtaining your Royall pardon, but promise my selfe from your benignity and clemency, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of that I have most zealously delivered.</p>
