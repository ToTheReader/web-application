      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y directing of this piece un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, renders me obvious to many censures, which I would willingly prevent by declaring mine owne and your right thereto. Mine was the fortune to be made the unworthy preserver of it; yours is the worthy opinion you have of the Author and his Poems: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it easily be determined, whether your affection to them hath made you (by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) more able to judge of them, then your ability to judge of them hath made you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

In this presumptuous act of mine, I expresse my two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold zeale; to him and your noble selfe, who have built him a more honourable monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that faire opinion you have of him, then any inscription subject to the wearing of time can be. You will finde him in this Poem as active as in others, to many of which, the dull apprehensions of former times gave but slender allowance, from malitious custome more than reason: yet they have since by your candid selfe and others beene cleerely vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. You shall oblige by your acceptance of this acknowledgement (which is the best I can render you, mine own weake labours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too unworthy your judicious perusall) him that is ambitious to be known</p>
