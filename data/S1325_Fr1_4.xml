   </head>
   <l>ON this book, Reader, lay thy hand and swear,</l>
   <l>Ovid himself is Metamorphos'd here.</l>
   <l>Was his old Romane gown thread-bare and old,</l>
   <l>Whom thou hast rob'd in cloth of English gold?</l>
   <l>'Twere infidelitie to think (I trow)</l>
   <l>His Muse with golden feet a begging go.</l>
   <l>Yet I admire at this unwonted store:</l>
   <l>Poet had ne'r two suits at once before.</l>
   <l>Who views these wel-form'd lines with judgement, shall</l>
   <l>Think 't not translated but Originall:</l>
   <l>'T is known what bloud by these most active strains</l>
   <l>The Muse of Ovid carri'd in her veins.</l>
   <l>Compare them both and you shall find it true,</l>
   <l>The gold 's the same, but the impression 's new.</l>
   <l>The noble heat of thy inspired brain</l>
   <l>Tri'd, found it pure, and minted it again.</l>
   <l>'Tis so true done, it seems in every line</l>
   <l>Thy soul was in his breast, or his in thine.</l>
   <l>He 's metempsychos'd, and these verses fame</l>
   <l>Speak but old Ovid in a newer name.</l>
   <l>O had my thoughts but seen the sense, when thine</l>
   <l>Unti'd the knots of everie golden line,</l>
   <l>I might have learn'd to make a verse by thee,</l>
   <l>In viewing Wit in its Anatomie.</l>
   <l>Thy modest Muse doth not know how to rore</l>
   <l>Like a Xantippe or an Oyster whore.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>Thy breath is short but sweet: It shews thy style</l>
   <l>Runnes like smooth Helicon, not troubled Nile:</l>
   <l>Not like bold ignorance, whose thundring words</l>
   <l>Strike the sense dead, whose sawcie vein affords</l>
   <l>Nothing but wind and storm, at length to have</l>
   <l>Their wit o'rwhelmed in the troubled wave.</l>
   <l>Now Ovid hath his wish, that he may be</l>
   <l>In English read upon a Ladies knee.</l>
   <l>The Romane Caesars plac'd their names upon</l>
   <l>The gladded brow of everie crowned moon;</l>
   <l>And to preserve their Saints deceased fames,</l>
   <l>Into their Calendar enroll'd their names.</l>
   <l>Thy name outfaceth all their glories; here</l>
   <l>It fills a Calendar and crowns a Year.</l>
   <l>'T is thou alone dost not subscribe to Fate:</l>
   <l>Thy Calendar shall ne'r be out of Date.</l>
