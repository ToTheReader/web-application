      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nnumerable are the sleights of Satan, to hinder a Christian in his course towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by exciting the corruption of his own heart to disturbe him, when he is about to doe any good; or by discouraging him with inward terrours, when he would solace himselfe with heavenly comforts; or by disheartening him under the feares of sufferings, when hee should be resolute in a good cause. A type whereof were the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whose servitude was redoubled, when they turned themselves to forsake <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Wherefore we have much neede of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian fortitude, according to that direction; <hi>Watch ye, stand fast, quit your selves like men:</hi>

      </note> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since Satan, like a Serpentine Crocodile pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is by resistance put to flight.</p>
   <p>But, as in warres, (which the <hi>Philistines</hi> knew well in putting their hope in <hi>Goliah</hi>) the chiefe strength of the Souldiers lyeth in their Captaine, so in spirituall conflicts, all a Christians strength is in Christ, and from him. For, before our conversion, we
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>were of no strength:</hi> since our conversion, <hi>we are not sufficient of our selves to think a good thought.</hi> And, to worke out from the Saints all selfe-confidence, God, by their falls teacheth them, <hi>To rejoyce in the Lord Iesus, and to have no confidence in the flesh.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whatsoever Christ hath for us is made ours by <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the hand of the soule enriching it by receiving Christ, who is <hi>the treasure hid in the field,</hi> and with him, those <hi>unsearchable riches</hi> of grace, which are revealed and offered in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: Yea it is part of our spirituall armour. That which was fabulously spoken of the race of Gyants, is truly said of a Christian, hee is borne with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour upon him;<note place="margin">

   <p>Now, as all rivers returne into the sea, whence they came, so the beleeving soule, having received all from Christ, returneth all to Christ. For thus the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever reasoneth. Was Gods undeserved, unexpected love such to me, that he spared not his onely begotten

Sonne, but gave him to die for mee? Its but aequall that I should live to him, die for him, bring in my strength, time, gifts, liberty, all that I have, all that I am, in his service, to his glory. That affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whence these resolutions arise, is called <hi>Love,</hi> which so inclineth the soule, that it moveth in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line towards that obiect, wherein it expecteth contentment. The soule is miserably deluded in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the winde, and in taking ayme at a flying fowle, whilest it seekes happinesse in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which appeares in the restlesnesse of those irregular agitations, and endlesse motions of the mindes of ambitious, voluptuous and covetous persons, whose frame of spirit is like the lower part of the elementary region, the seate of windes, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests and earthquakes, full of unquietnesse; whilest the beleevers soule, like that part towards heaven, which is alwayes peaceable and still, enioyeth true rest and ioy. And indeed the perfection of our spirits cannot be but in union with the chiefe of spirits, which communicateth his goodnesse to the creature according to its capacity. This affection of Love, as it reflecteth upon Christ, being a fruit and effect of his love to us apprehended by faith, is the subiect of the second part of the following Treatise in 7. Sermons.</p>

into the methods of the Tempter, knowing upon what rockes the faith of many suffers shipwracke; that neither the weak Christian might lose the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his faith, through want of evidences, nor the presumptuous rest upon a fancy in stead of faith, nor the adversaries be emboldened to cast upon us, by reason of this doctrine of Iustification by faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their wonted nicknames of <hi>Soli-fidians,</hi> and <hi>Nulli-fidians</hi>; throughout the whole Treatise, and more especially in the last Sermon, he discourseth of <hi>good Workes,</hi> as they arise from faith and love. This is the summe of the faithfull and fruitfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this Reverend, learned and godly Minister of the Gospell, who whilest he lived was an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the life of faith and love, and of good workes, to so many as were acquainted with his aequall and even walking in the wayes of God, in the severall turnings and occasions of his life. But it will be too much iniury to the godly Reader to be detained lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the porch. Wee now dismisse thee to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this profitable worke, beseeching God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease faith, and to perfect love in thy heart, that thou maist be fruitfull in good workes.</p>
