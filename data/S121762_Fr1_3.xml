   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of loue and
honor, that the
nature of <hi>Truth</hi>
is, the more sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull
without
doubt, and hatefull it must be, to doe
any violence vnto it. For, where more
occasions are offered, to staie men from
their euill purposes, there to passe the
bondes of rightuousnes, it proueth a
greater impudencie. As for example,
in young ladies, whom cōplexion hath
made bewtifull, and lacke of brothers
onlye heires, and good education wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of all praises, and pure loue of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
hath perswaded to contynue vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
if any act dishonorable, or vile ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
be committed, what straunger is so
vnkind and far of from the countrie
or sight of that person and vertue,
which but hearing only of her iniurie,
doth not rise in his hart, againste the
<pb facs="3"/>
worker of it. But, what virgin euer
was there, so faire, so princelie, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so chast, and so without all spott,
as <hi>Truth?</hi> And what greater vilanie
can be practised, then by dissimbling,
lying, slaundering, &amp; blind reasoning,
to go about to defloure such a vertue?
Surelie, yf those eyes and iudgementes,
by which spirituall bewties are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
were as generallie and cōmonlie
in mens heades, as the bodilie eyes are,
which iudge of colours, it would offend
the gentell bloude and hart, a thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
tymes more, to see the truth abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
then to behold a Lucretia (yf you
will) of their familie violentlie to be
taken of some villane, and constrayned
to serue hym at his pleasure. But, so
greate and greauouse is the plage,
which thorough Adam his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
falleth vpon euery soule, our edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
allso and conuersation is so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
&amp; corruptible, by reason of grosse
<pb facs="3"/>
and sensible thinges, with the which we
are so well acquaynted, that a blowe
geauen vnto some worshipfull frinde
of ours, or a fowle worde and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
spoken to the face of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Prince, doth more frett the hart
with compassion or indignation, then
when we heare it readen neuer so plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie
and treatablie, that: <hi>Pilate then
toke Iesus and whipped him.</hi>
      <note place="margin">10. 19.</note>
      <hi>And
the souldiars, platting a crowne of
thornes, dyd put it on vpon his
head, and set a purple robe abowt
hym. And thei came to hym, and
saied: Haile, o kyng of the Iewes,
and thei boxed and buffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ed him.</hi>
After which sort, yf but a cusson of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
Christian Prince in the world▪
should be ordered of his tenantes and
seruantes at this present, what excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
would we make, and what
detestations would we cōceiue against
them? There is not vndoubtedlie, ther
<pb facs="4"/>
is not, that zeale for the truth it self,
which is vttered in defence of playne
vanitie: and God most allmightie and
glorious, is not so attentiuelie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as a man, or a mase, or a badge
onlie vpon the sleeue, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison. For defence yet
of which thinges so small, how greate
angers and stomakes are taken, and
how much is he cōtemned in the world,
which dissembleth an iniurie in such
matters? And in deede, allthough the
thinges them selues are but simple, yet
the truthe is in them allso, moderatelie
to be folowed, and in right iudgement
it were not to be suffered, that either
officers, either orders, should be freelie
disgraced: how much more iustlie then
are the sacramētes &amp; the auncient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Catholike faith, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of all sober heades, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
in all humilitie, and if truth in
wordlie and common matters be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb facs="4"/>
of euery honest man, whi is the
euerlasting veritie, and cause of owr
sowle, which should be chiefest, either
not sought for, when it is easelie to be
fownd, either els not cared for, when
it is euidentlie perceaued. Hath he
(trow you) a good iudgement or a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hart, which either affecteth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and wil not turne ouer the leffe,
least he should haue a conscience of
the truthe once knowen, either being
conuinced by euident reason, that his
forfathers beleiued well and trulie,
doth thinke that diuines onlie haue to
thinke of such matters, and foloweth
outwardlie the fond and newfound
brothers? Or thei, which reade the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
of both sides, and either through
lightnes and vanitie doe beare awaye
no more then the phrase and maner of
writing of the authors, either for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and enemitie, consider onlie how to
find faultes with the writer, doe thei
<pb facs="5"/>
shew therein, anye point of great witt
and grauitie? And so, whiles some
thinke, and those I feare no young ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
or beggars, <hi>I hold with Christ
whom all confesse, and further if
I should consider the question, I
might be made, to my cost, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist:</hi>
and others saie priuilie, <hi>in deed
the old religion is best, when all is
done, but we must beare a litle
with the world:</hi> further when on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort reporteth, <hi>it is smoothelie
done, or he paieth his aduersarie
home, or he runneth lyke oile, or
he byteth lyke vineger:</hi> and finallie
whiles others saie, directing their eye
not to the matter, but against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that, <hi>herein he declareth litle
good nurture in not belording so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
person, or he misseth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie
of speach, or he telleth old
dreames and stories, or he iesteth
and dalieth all togeather:</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb facs="5"/>
is, that verie few do honor the
truth, or seeke ernestlie for it. For,
thei which refuse to be acquainted
with it, or dissimble the knowledge
thereof, doe without all doubt geaue
occasion to disgracing of it. Like as in
court, to make as though you knew
not some notable and worthie Lord,
it is halfe a dishonor vnto hym. And
others, which busie themselues about
wordes and titles, and passe ouer, with
out consideration, the sense of thinges
and the matter, are lyke them which
loke a man in the face, whiles he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them a sadd tale for their profite,
&amp; thinke all that while vpon nothing
els in a maner, but what tailer it shold
be, which made his cote and apparell.
I appeale therefore vnto euerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and my selfe I prouoke to the
vttering, and the, (Reader) to the
considering of the truthe.</p>
   <p>It is not inough to reade, but thow
<pb facs="6"/>
must allso consider, and it litle profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to consider, except it be a truthe
worth the marking. Of the .ij. women,
which striued before Salomō, one told
a long tale, of her dwelling in one hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
togeather with her felowe, of her
owne and her felowes childebearing,
of her quicke child taken in the night
season from her side, and the placing
of her companions dead boye in her
bosome, with other such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
more, to moue perchaunse some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
When she had ended: <hi>It ys
not so</hi> (quod the other woman vnto
her) <hi>as thou saiest,</hi>
      <note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note>
      <hi>but thy soune
ys deade, and myne lyueth.</hi> But on
the other side, <hi>Thou lyest,</hi> saieth she,
<hi>for my soune ys a lyue, and thyne
ys deade.</hi> And thus thei striued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
te kinge. Now, what sentence the
wise Prince gaue, it is commonlye
knowen, as how he called for a sword,
and commaunding the quick child to
<pb facs="6"/>
be diuided in .ij. partes, sought to find
out thereby, in which of the .ij. women
the naturall compassion ouer her child
would sonest appeare. Which strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vttering it self brimly, in one of
them, as he wittilie had cōceiued, vnto
her he apointed the quicke child, and
sensiblie dissolued a secrete question.
Of which example, this I thinke, may
be well gathered, that in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
we goe strayt to the quicke of
the question, and rest not vpon the
by matters. For, in disputing of the
Sacrament of the aultar, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
whether some allwaies should
communicate, thou lyest saieth one,
thou blasphemiest saieth the other,
this is an itching folie saieth one, this
is sluttisshe eloquence saith the other,
you playe apishe partes saieth one, you
be like S. George an horsebacke saieth
the other, and this is no litle sport vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
manie to see, how contrarie sides can
<pb facs="7"/>
cutt one the other. But this vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlye
is nothing to the question, how
euen one is with the other. For cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
such odd wordes, as I can not tell
hou thei come in, and serue to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of affections, so let hym take
heede which vseth them, that thei cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and agree with the matter, and
let other be warned, which are the
readers or hearers, not to gape after
such glauncies, which happ now and
then in sadd writing, but to marke
aduisedlye what truth is in question,
and neither by acclamation to the
wordlie proceedinges, neither indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against the old faith and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
to shrinke in anye part from
it. Wich is (me thinketh) to call for
a Salomons sword, and not to sitt still
in iudgement with harkening after
such by phrases, as are not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the question. The sharpnes
of which sword will shew, who is the
<pb facs="7"/>
false harlot, and who is loth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie
examined, caring not what
absurditie he permitteth, so that he
be not openlie confounded, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as I may saye) of the question
be not espyied. And this, I speake, not
onlye for the indifferent reader his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
whom I wisshe to consider the
truth ernestly, but for our ease allso in
this fight with the Protestantes, that
we might come to some peace and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusion.
For, to the bokes of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
which of late haue ben printed,
some of the answers, and the most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
are these: <hi>It is an vnlerned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
it doth not obserue the stiles &amp;
titles which it should doe, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
hym but Master, whom it
should call my Lord, it alleageth
such authorities as we neuer saw,
it reciteth visions which are not
in scripture, it hath false Latin in
it, it is full of skoffes and tauntes.</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
As who should thinke, the argument
were dissolued, if the maker of it were
reproued, for lisping in his vtterance,
or making a wrie mouth vpon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.
For, if these were heighnous
faultes, and might in deede be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
against the Catholikes, or if there
were not a perfect hatred, which the
holye Prophete boldlye confesseth,<note place="margin">Psal. 138</note> in
louing the persons of his enemies, with
detesting to the vttermost, and defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their iniquities, yet a wise prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
would not speake at all of them,
or lightlie passe away from such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and go exactlie to the point of the
question, and proue that it toucheth
not the state of his religion.</p>
   <p>Yet I graunt, if a religion were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by long vse of all Christendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
it were inough to tell the people,
that the contrarie is not to be credited:
and thei without more wordes ought
to be perswaded, as bound to folow an
<pb facs="8"/>
vniuersall authoritie of Catholike prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
and Bishopes. But when new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are brought furth in to open pul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pites,
and thei cōmended by no formar
authoritie, allso when straunge Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spells
are confirmed by no miracles, but
onlye by naked affirmations, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
interpretatiōs, that <hi>this is true,</hi>
and <hi>this we vnderstād it,</hi> or els by no
likelie and probable reasons, by which
the vnderstanding might be sumwhat
directed, it is no honest and indifferent
dealing, that when such their wordes
and argumēts are disproued, it should
be inough for them to answer againe,
<hi>you lie,</hi> or <hi>you iest,</hi> or <hi>you fauor
not the pure and sincere Ghospell.</hi>
I gather by the handeling of other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
what I haue to prouide for,
about my owne doings.</p>
   <p>A preacher at paules crosse, (in an
euill houre) prouoked all the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
in the world, vpon manifold arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb facs="9"/>
against him (for part of his lying)
a short confutation was straitwaies
put in writing. which for the shortnes
of it, being easelie copied out, and for
the truth and soundnes of it, liked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
well of the Catholikes, through
much goeing abrode in to manie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and free communicating of it vnto
diuers persons, it cummeth at length
vnto a protestāts handes, which befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that, was desirous of it. Which, (to
the cōmendacion of his zeale vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie,
although not of his science) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
with speede an answer vnto it, and
intitled it, <hi>An answer in defence of
the truth. &amp;c.</hi> Wherin you may note,
how much in a short time the world is
chaunged. For, at that season, simple
and familiar letters of Catholikes, not
framed to such purposes, were out of
hand answered, and put in print. Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisies
also, which went abrode without
name from frind to frind, were sought
<pb facs="9"/>
and inquired for curiouslie, and set
furth in print to be considered. Yet
now, when thei are prouoked againe
and againe, to make good the crakes
sett on their Ghospell, thei worke (I
feare) by deceipts and subtelties, and
haue either no answer at all to make,
or that which thei haue made is not
lyked of their fauorers, or els thei will
make so manie wordes and so greate
a worke, that lyke craftie wormes
thei maye couer themselues vnder lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and still mainteine a russhing,
with creeping yet awaye from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or els thei are not so hott in spri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
as thei were wont to be. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that called <hi>Defence of the
truth,</hi> being sent vnto me by a great
fauorer of the proceedinges, and sent
of verye good will and frindshipp,
that I should be reformed (after his
desire) by it, by considering how the
<pb facs="10"/>
Papi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es are allwayes repelled, I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
not long, but made a reply again<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
it, the veritie of our cause was so
euident, and the false demeanure of
the aduersarie, that I might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Catholike, and turne the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of crakers in to confusion. What
I dyd, that it might come in to the
handes of our aduersaries, and find
emong them a direct answer vnto it,
or els a quiet geauing ouer of their
further striuing against the truthe,
allthough it be harmelesse, yet being
needelesse, I will not declare it. Yet,
this I am bold to saye, that thei might
(if thei would) haue done by this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
as thei dyd by the Apologie (as
thei termed it) of priuate masse, and
haue set it furth in print with their
answer vnto it, for the glorie of their
religion, and much liberalitie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
poore Catholikes, whose writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="10"/>
without the author his labors and
charges, full diligentlie thei haue
printed. Which, whether it were
worth the answer, or no, therein let
anye reasonable men be iudges, and let
the truthe be considered, I praie the
(Reader) most hartelye, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of anye my manner of writing.
Not because I am not willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
to euerye point that thei maye
haue against me, but that the truthe
should be seen the better, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
inuectiues are not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For, (as I haue saied,) I feare,
by the examples of other, lest this will
be their chiefest answer: <hi>It is not
worth the answering, it is full of
toyes and fancies. It forgetteth
good nurture in writing. &amp;c.</hi> As
who should thinke, that thei (like
gentle doues) had no manner of gall
<pb facs="11"/>
in their writinges, or as though that
a wiseman might not dissimble an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
and answer to the matter direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
But, be it so, you be patient, quiet,
fairespoken, innocent, harmelesse, you
thinke euill of no man, you praie for
the Pope and the Cardinals, you reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the name of religious folkes, you
know not how to nickname the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
no bitternes, no skoffing, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteousnes,
is in your preachinges and
writinges espied, and the contrarie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are in Catholikes. Forgeaue vs
then, I praie you, these our singular
faultes, considering yourselues, that
you allso maye be tempted. And if a
sharpe word or sentence, allthough it
be medicinable, must not be spoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, take awaye all such wordes in
this boke, as may troble your patience,
and let the truthe by itselfe be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

and briefelye answer iust ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</p>

   <p>Therefor let the truthe be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the substance of the matter
regarded, that, when preachers and
prelates find fault with our maner of
wrytinge, as though all the boke we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

nothing els to be in it, thou (indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

we be like Luther and skoffers,

<pb facs="13"/>
what religion thei be of, and how sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefullie
they abuse their whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
The end is this, let no honest
man be ashamed of the truthe, let no
protestant belie the truthe, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a euill cause, there are wittes to
discusse it, and prouing our matters
so euidentlie, why is no more regard
made of them? Yf our Lorde be the
God, folow hym, if Baal be he, folow
hym. Yf we slaunder or misreport our

   <p>That they maye be short and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious,

of all Christendome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them by longe contynuance,
may with reason beleue rather the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
whose wordes shall be found
more truer, &amp; more certaine to build,
or els beware vpon (as thei haue to
mistrust their deuotions) lest in deede
thei be of no religion. For which kynd
of men, if it were not, lesse preuailyng
against the truthe and lesse alteration
would be permitted, but seeing man is
free and master of his owne actions,
<pb facs="14"/>
thei can be no more then warned, that
thei seeke after truth, and folowe it.
God be mercifull vnto vs, and if he
hath saied it by some of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
