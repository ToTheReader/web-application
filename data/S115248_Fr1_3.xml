And yet it greatly greeues thee that thy glory which thou wishest for, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which thou hopest for, and thy King and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome for whom thou so lokest, and longest for, is so long from thee: And no maruel, for it is the property of a faythfull louer, not quietly to beare the absence, but ardently to desire the presence, the pleasaunt speeche, and louing, embracings of her beloued.
<pb facs="4"/>
And yet most of all it greeues thee to see the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse boldnes of that abhominable strumpet the whore of Babilon, which blusheth not to call her selfe the onely spouse of thy Christ: and to call thee an harlot: to boast of her externall beautie, and to cast in thy teeth thy outward deformitie: to bragge of her antiquitie, fame and glorious estate, and to tell thee of thy noueltie, pouertie, and miserie. Hence it commeth, that thou art no where in quiet from such taunts and chidings, nor thy mēbers any where safe frō her bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye persecution. Hence it is, that before the world, which is the Sonne of this naughtie houswife, thou art contemned, hated, and afflicted: and she as the Queene of heauen is adored, loued, and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: with her haue all nations committed fornication, and the Kings of the earth haue become frantike with Idolatrous wyne of her poysoned doctrine. And hence commeth thy deepe sighes, thy mournfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and the intolerable vexation of minde which thou art in. Hence it is that thou canst not be mery. But comfort thy selfe, faint not (thou beloued of Christ) for thy husband for thy sake hath made her naughtines to be knowen,<note place="margin">Apoc. 17,</note> and she which was so loued is now hated, and was glorious for her externall fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is nowe become odious to many, for her spiritual filthines. Haue pacience therefore but a little whyle, and thou shalt see her, to be of none accompt: for thy louer in whom thou delightest, shall bring her to such shame, as she shall not be able to showe her head out of hell, when thou shalt be in glorye with thy beloued. Nowe will I make thee priuie, with whom this naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiepacke (which now is many wayes knowen to all the world) hath had to do a long whyle since, first shee lefte to fauour the, and began to fancie the wicked doctrine of the Gentiles: her baude, &amp; thy sworne enemy.

But what happened afterward? These Locustes, to wit, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and horrible crewe of idle prelates, Priestes, and Friers, with their abhominable king, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Paule</hi> dooth call <gap reason="foreign">

But now would you haue them better described? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth they are for theyr intolerable pride, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, lyke vnto horses, prepared to the battaile, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens heare they haue, because they are in dealinges light, in behauior wanton: Lions teeth, for their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, shieldes as it were of iron, to note their obstinacie▪ In wordes they seemed courteous, and therefore they

had the faces of men, but in deede they prooued villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and therefore they had in their tailes the sting of Scorpions. These made a noyse as it were of manye winges, which noted the fame of the Popes holinesse. And these had power to hurt, and yet not all thinges, but onely men, and yet not all men, but those which had not the marke of God in their foreheads. And yet they could not plague at their pleasure, but in certaine monthes: and those not in Winter, but in Somer.

   <p>Now marke I beseech thee, and call into mynde the woordes of thy beloued, which gaue his Apostles to vnderstand, that before his comming (meaning before he celebrates his marriage in the kingdome of his almighty father) the sounde of the Gospell as it were by a Trumpet,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> should be heard throughout all the world, that so, both the number of thy friendes might be greatly multiplyed &amp;, this child of perdition by the final end of al thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Which things to thy comfort thou mayst perceaue to be com to passe already euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the sixt houre or midle of of the sixt day, or six thousand yeare of the worldes creation. Thou seest how the voyce of the Gospell hath sounded in al quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, thou seest how that son of perditiō with the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> sitting vpō a purpled and bloodye beast, is by the breath of Gods woorde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: thou seest also (which is most to thy glory, and their perpetuall prayse) how the Kings of the

earth (which were sometime the tenne hornes and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of that beast, by whom shee receyued both such aucthoritie that shee myght persecute, and such titles, that shee was honored as a Goddesse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced as the Queene of heauen) thou seest I say, whom they did honour as a Queene, how they doo hate for a Queane: and whom they did reuerence like a Goddesse, how they renounce as the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye to godlines: and whom they did by an ignorant zeale enrich with all things that myght cause her to be in the eyes of all mē glorious, how they worthily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerish, &amp; endeuour by all meanes to make her odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, hath caused me for your comfort by wryting to place before your eyes such vndoubted signes of his cōming, although I will not take vpon me to tel the very houre, day, and yeare, which is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to God alone) that easely you will beleue and perswade your selfe that it will not be long before he come: this day will he visit thee before the Sunne be set, of which the most part is consumed, noone is past it is now one of the clocke, and therfore his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming must needes be nigh. These and such like things you shall perceyue to be handled in this booke. Where I haue erred, amend the fault, and forgeue the maker: (for to your iudgement I submit me) which is the onely thing I desire, after I haue obtayned your ernest prayers to your beloued, in my behalfe, that I may accompany you in the fayth, and spiritual blessings, with which in Christ through the meere grace of God the father you are especially adorned: and that with you I may haue the same communion of all celestiall benefites, and be partaker of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, and God the father. Fare you well, and God graunt you now and euermore the quietnes of mind, and perpetuall delight, with euerlasting comfort in Christ by the holy Ghost. Amen. From Emden.</p>
