of iudgements (sweet <hi>Ma:</hi>) wandring
like pasportles men, in contempt of the
diuine discipline of Poesie, that a man
may well feare to frequent their walks:

   <p>But that Poesie should be as peruiall as Oratorie, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
her speciall orna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

and to make the Asse runne proude of his eares; to take away
str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ngth from Lyons, and giue Cammels hornes.</p>
   <p>That, <hi>Enargia,</hi> or cleerenes of representation, requird in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Poems is not the perspicuous deliuery of a lowe inuention;
but high, and harty inuention exprest in most significant, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
phrase; it serues not a skilfull Painters turne, to draw the
figure of a face onely to make knowne who it represents; but hee
must lymn, giue luster, shaddow, and heightning; which though
ignorants will esteeme spic'd, and too curious, yet such as haue the
iudiciall perspectiue, will see it hath, motion, spirit and life.</p>
   <p>There is no confection made to last, but it is admitted more
cost and skill then presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

that which being with a little endeuour serched, ads a kinde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie

   <p>Obscuritie in affection of words, &amp; indigested concets, is pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall

that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>rknes wil I still labour to be shaddowed; rich Minerals are
digd out of the bowels of the earth, not found in the superficies and
dust of it; charms made of vnlerned characters are not consecrate
by the Muses which are diuine artists, but by <hi>Euippes</hi> daughters,
that challengd them with meere na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ure, whose brests I doubt not
had beene well worthy commendation, if their comparison had not
turnd them into Pyes.</p>
   <p>Thus (not affecting glory for mine owne sleight labors, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
other should be more worthely glorious, nor professing sacred
Poesie in any degree,) I thought good to submit to your apt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
