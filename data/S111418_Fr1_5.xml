   <head>¶To my Lord the Right <hi>reuerend Cardinall of Sens, keper of</hi> the great seales of France: Andrew Theuet wisheth peace and felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Lorde,</hi> being sufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, (how greatly) after the moste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and no lesse great and paynfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, to the which it pleased the King to employe and bestowe your prudencie (&amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casting witt) you take pleasure not onely to reade, but also to see and taaste, some fayre Historie, the which among so many cares, might recreat your spirite and giue it a delectable libertie of his moste graue and carefull businesse. I haue boldened my selfe to present vnto you this my discourse of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger farre voyage made into <hi>India America,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by vs named <hi>Fraunce Antartike,</hi> being partly peopled and partly discouered by our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes, a land which at this day may be called <hi>the fourth parte of the vvorlde,</hi> not onely by the withdrawings of our orizons, as by the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of nature of bests, and temperatnesse of the ayre of the countrey. Also for that none hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath sought it out, supposing al Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb facs="6"/>
(yea persuading with themselues) that the world was lymitted in that which the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to vs had shewed. And although that this worke semeth to me of it selfe to be very litle to be offered before the eyes of your Lordship, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the greatnesse of your name will extol the basenesse of my worke: seing also that I am assured wel of your wonted clemēcie, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and desire to heare wonderfull things, that easily you will iudge howe that my intention doeth tende to no other ende but onely to make you vnderstand, that I haue no other delyght than to offer vnto you that thing, of the which you may draw and receiue some contentation, and wherein sometimes, you shalbe eased of the great and troublesome affayres which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in thys degree and office, that you holde. For there is no mind or spirit be it neuer so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but that sometymes is troubled with the quicke dispatch, graue and weighty affaires of a common weale. Therefore it is needefull sometimes to ordayne as the learned Phisition doth to a pacient or sicke body, some chaunge of meates to recreate the appetite of them which by their infirmitie and sicknesse, cannot broke nor taste one kind of meate continually, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so pleasant.</p>
   <p>This therefore is the cause why the ancient Philosophers and others did oftentimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe themselues from being wrapped in or charged with the publike affayres. As also the
<pb facs="6"/>
great Orator <hi>Cicero</hi> witnesseth to haue absen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe many tymes from the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to the great displeasure of the cytizens) for to remayne in his countreyhouse to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the plesant and Harmonicall melodie of the birdes. Seing then that among oures, as he among the <hi>Romaynes,</hi> for your singular erudition, prudencie, and eloquence, you are as chiefe and principall minister of the triumphant common weale of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and such a one as describeth <hi>Plato</hi> in his common weale, that is to know, great Lorde, and a louer of vertue and science, therefore it is not without reason to imitate and folow him in this point. Euen so (my good Lorde) as returning all weake and wery of so long a voyage, I was by you first of your grace receiued and welcomed home, which gaue me to vnderstand and know, that you are the singular patron of vertue and of all those, that folowe it also to my iudgement, I thinke I could not direct this my little labour to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to you, the which if it please you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue so beningly as with a good &amp; affectioned will I do present and direct it, and also to reade and peruse it, you shal find in my opinion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to recreate your spirites, and to holde me yours for euer. Although that already for many causes I feele my selfe greatly bound and holdē to do most humble and obedient seruice to your lordship: to whom I besech the creator to giue all good lucke and prosperitie.</p>
