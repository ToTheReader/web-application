      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Haste, and matchlesse VIRGIN, I might iustly be taxed to haue forgot my selfe doubly, at one time: as well, concerning my bounden duety towards your beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous selfe, as in respect of the many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, which that great Scholler learned <hi>Varchi,</hi> doth merit, if I should not (without lingring or temporising any longer) make a Present vnto the world, of this his admirable and dainty conceited Lecture, shadowed vnder your sweet and much prised Name; for then, like a malitious fore-stauling Merchant, I should engrosse vnto my selfe, that deare commoditie of Praise, which is onely due to such a worthy man alone, and like an vnthankefull person, shew but little, or rather nothing at all, how much I am beholding vnto you, as well in my thoughts, as in all other my proceedings whatsoeuer. Which Acknowledgement (although I must needes confesse I am to blame therein) enuiting, and as it were, wooing mee to make you some satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for my backewardnesse in this poynt, to which your

peerelesse Worth, and spotlesse Vertue draw mee on, and not knowing what fit course to take (considering I haue not (as now) any thing of mine owne, worthy of your gracious acceptance) yet hath it beene some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto mee, in that my minde giueth mee, that this Discourse following shall be sufficient to shew some part of my good meaning towards you: as likewise in some sort to satisfie the excellency of graue VARCHI'S selfe. And because I know that it is a meere vanitie of such, as praysing and extolling the Bountie and Goodnesse of God, imagine that by their many words (onely) they shall be able to commend it the more; therefore I hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and concealing the prayses of VARCHI, and of Monsig<seg rend="sup">or</seg>
      <hi>De la</hi> CASA, will onely say, that they (both) will hold themselues sufficiently commended, when they shall vnderstand, that this their much wisht-for Treatise, shall be read and esteemed of, by such a prayse-worthy Creature as is your selfe, your admirable wit and sound Iudgement in euery thing, being such as you farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any one of your sexe, and therefore, counted one of our Italian Paragons, and that not vnworthily. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make bold, to present you with this deepe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Oration or Speech, and relying vpon the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Affabilitie of your courteous Nature, desire to be commanded by the same alwayes.</p>
