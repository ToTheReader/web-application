   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HERE AS</hi> AVGVSTINE <hi>TOOKE OC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by the captiuity of the</hi> Romaines <hi>to write of the</hi> Cittie of GOD, <hi>to answer them, which iniuriouslie slaundered the</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>as the cause of those enormities and miseries, which befell them: It shall not be lost labour for vs (sounding the depth of the matter) to relate from the Originall, what kinde of people the</hi> Gothes <hi>were, how they came into</hi> Italie, <hi>and surprized the</hi> Cittie of Rome. ¶ <hi>First it is cleare and euident, that the former age named those</hi> Getes, <hi>whome the succeeding age named</hi> Gothes, <hi>because this age adulterated, and corrupted many of the ancient wordes. For those two Poets, to wit,</hi> RVTILVS <hi>and</hi> CLAVDIAN, <hi>when-soeuer they speake of the</hi> Gothes, <hi>doe alwaies name</hi> Getes. OROSIVS <hi>also in his Historie sayth, the</hi> Getes <hi>who now are named</hi> Goths, <hi>departing out of their Countrie with bagge and baggage, leauing their houses emptie, entred safely into the</hi> Romaine Prouinces <hi>with all their forces, being such a people, as</hi> ALEXANDER <hi>said were to be auoided,</hi> PYRRHVS <hi>abhorred, and</hi> CaeSAR <hi>shunned.</hi> HIEROME <hi>vpon</hi> Genesis, <hi>testifieth that the</hi> Gothes <hi>were named</hi> Getes <hi>of the learned in former time. Also they were</hi> Getes <hi>which inhabited about the Riuer</hi> Ister, <hi>as</hi> STRABO, MELA, PLINIE, <hi>and others auerre: possessing the Region adiacent, a great part of it lying waste and vnmanured, being intemperate through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of cold: also the further parts of</hi> Ister <hi>to</hi> Scithia, <hi>and the hether parts towards</hi> Thracia. <hi>Where the Towne</hi> Tomus <hi>is, famous by the banishment of</hi> OVID, <hi>who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten writeth, that he liued amongst the</hi> Getes: <hi>They also inhabited the</hi> Mediterranean <hi>parts towards</hi> Germanie, <hi>and the spring head of the Riuer</hi> Ister. STRABO <hi>writeth in his seauenth book, that in former time they were named</hi> DACI <hi>and</hi> DAVI, <hi>when those nearer vnto</hi> Pontus <hi>were named</hi> GETES <hi>by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and that both those people
<pb facs="6"/>
spake one kinde of language. Although</hi> PLINIE <hi>intimateth vnto vs, that there was no other difference betweene this people, but that the</hi> Greekes <hi>named them</hi> Getes, <hi>whome the</hi> Romaines <hi>called</hi> Daci. <hi>But wee will follow</hi> STRABO <hi>in this place. The</hi> Getes <hi>(sayth hee), are a barbarous and sauage nation, strong and of a stout minde, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death, because they are perswaded that the soules doe returne againe, as</hi> MELA <hi>writeth: or if they doe not returne, yet that they are not vttterly extinguished, and that they remoue into better places: But if neither happen, yet that death is better than life. It is reported that in later times the</hi> Getes <hi>were named</hi> Ostrogothes, <hi>and the</hi> Daci <hi>called</hi> Visigothes <hi>after their countrey names: because these bordered more toward the West, and the other more toward the East. But oftentimes these names are attributed as well to the one as to the other, without any difference, both by the olde and new writers. They report that this nation when the</hi> Romaines <hi>did flourish most, made an inuasion into a Prouince of the people of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the warre of</hi> MITHRIDATES: <hi>whome</hi> LVCVLLVS <hi>beeing Generall, and managing the military affaires in</hi> Asia, <hi>with a great armie expelled out of</hi> Misia.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>After that they departed out of their owne countrey boundes with</hi> Baerebista <hi>their Captaine after hee had accustomed them to labour and millitary discipline, and that they brought many Nations vnder the yoke of subiection. And that hauing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the riuer</hi> Isther <hi>with a great armie, they wasted and spoyled</hi> Thracia, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Illiryum <hi>farre into the countries, putting the</hi> Romaines <hi>in great feare of them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And that while the</hi> Romaines <hi>were making ready their forces to goe out against them</hi> BaeREBISTA <hi>their Captaine dyed.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>AVGVSTVS <hi>sent forth almost tenne Legions against them, and so wasted and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed their forces, that hee brought them from two hundred thousand to forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and sped so well against them, that he had almost subiugated the whole Nation to the</hi> Romaine <hi>Empire. But a few yeares after they entring into the boundes of the</hi> Romaines, <hi>slew</hi> OPPIVS SABINVS, <hi>and his armie, who had borne the office of a</hi> Consull: <hi>yet</hi> CORNELIVS FVSCVS (DOMITIAN <hi>being Emperour) after many bickerings at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their fury.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>TRAIANVS <hi>the Emperor warred often against them, whereby he gotte him-selfe greate glory and renowne.</hi> ANTONIVS CARACALLA <hi>plagued them grieuously, oportunity seruing his turne, when they neither dreamed nor suspected any such matter. Also in the daies of</hi> GORDIANVS <hi>they spread them-selues often into the bounds of the</hi> Romains: <hi>But</hi> GOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIANVS <hi>the younger compelled them with little labour to depart out of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince with great losse. Now this stout and mutinous people, discontented with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their owne abode, many times hunted after oportunity to inuade the possessions of other nations.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Therefore</hi> PHILIPPVS VOSTRENSIS <hi>being Emperor (who first of the</hi> Romaine <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces professed Christian religion) More then three hundred thousand of them, making a great slaughter and spoyle, entred forciblie into</hi> Thracia <hi>and</hi> Mysia, <hi>adioyning neae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto them.</hi> DECIVS <hi>was sent to driue them away, who had such bad lucke in his attempts, that hee gaue ouer before he obtained his purpose, which thing he closely smothered succeeding</hi> PHILIPPVS <hi>in his gouernment.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Afterward</hi> GALLVS <hi>the father and</hi> VOLVSIANVS <hi>his son concluded a peace with them vpon conditions vnprofitable vnto them-selues, which the</hi> Gothes <hi>kept not very long, bearing them-selues bolde vpon the slothfulnesse and idlenesse of</hi> GALIENVS <hi>the Prince, and assayled not only to make an attempt against</hi> Thracia, <hi>and</hi> Mysia, <hi>but also against</hi> Asia Minor. <hi>They wasted and spoiled</hi> Bythinia, <hi>and returning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap>
      </hi> Europe, <hi>they made great spoyle and wast in</hi> Thrasia <hi>and</hi> Macedonia: <hi>and when</hi>

      </gap> put them to flight, pursuing them so hard at the heeles, that hee draue them into their owne boundes. But they did not stay long there, although now departing out of their bounds, they were to deale with a most valiant Prince, who had bone no lesse fortunate than he was valorous, if he had liued longer in his Princely gouernment <hi>CLAVDI S</hi> was the man which partly destroyed, and partly tooke CCC thousand of them. Which is an argument that the number of this people were almost infinite. For not many yeares after they rose vp in armes against <hi>AVRELIAVS,</hi> possessing the Empire, and were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished at the first encounter at <hi>Danubius. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> COTANTINVS</hi> made such a slaughter of them, that at last he inforced them to be at quiet for many yeres. For the condit on of their fight was such, that they did neither conquer without great harme done to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> enemies: nor were ouercome without much hurt done to them-selues And these things were acted by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> while they had proper places of their owne to inhabite. Now in the raigne of Prince <hi>VALENS,</hi> the <hi>Hunns</hi> which are likewise <hi>Scythians</hi> them-selues, yet more cruell, barbarous and rude, in the affaires of humane Commerce, remaining neare the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountaines, enclosed betweene <hi>Tanais</hi> and the people, named <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sagetae:</hi> chased the <hi>Gothes</hi> by force out of the region which they did inhabite. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this region be not very commodious for the vse of men, by reason of the extreme coldnes: yet the <hi>Hunns</hi> did esteeme it to bee more wholesome and pleasant than all the rest, being a people bred and brought vp in a soile seldome warmed with the beames of the sun. Now the <hi>Gothes</hi> driuen out of their country houses and dwelling places hauing <note place="margin">The Gothes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> driuen out of their country by the Hunns,</note> bene accustomed before time to inuade the bounds of other Nations, were now in such a narrow streight, that they must either valiantly lose their liues, or remaine within the possessions of strangers, hauing none of their owne. There are some that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that those <hi>Getes</hi> (which we said were named <hi>Ostrogothes)</hi> came into the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that the <hi>Visigothes</hi> dismayed and amated with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse fortune of their associats, aduised them-selues to shift their dwelling, dreading to abide the like tempest, that the <hi>Ostrogothes</hi> had suffered, the forces of the <hi>Hunns</hi> ouerflowing al, like the swelling Sea) spoiling and destroying the neighbouring countries round about. This matter induced the <hi>Visigothes</hi> to dispatch Ambassadors with spee dy expedition to <hi>VALENS</hi> the <hi>Romame Emperor,</hi> who in the name of the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humbly intreated, that he would grant them the countrey of <hi>Mysia,</hi> which is on this side the Riuer <hi>Danubius,</hi> for their habitation and dwelling, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>arnestly pretesting and vowing in the behalfe of all their Countrey-men; that they would all receiue the <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Religion,</hi> and become true and faithfull Tributaries to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defending those bounds of the <hi>Romanes</hi> by their sword and goods, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inuasions of the rest of the <hi>Scythians. VALENS</hi> pleased with their conutions, sent <hi>LVPI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>INIVS</hi> and <hi>MAVINVS</hi> vnto them, as <hi>Duumuiri</hi> to deuide the grounde, and assign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> places of habitations to the <hi>Visigoths.</hi> But they began to lay burthens of oppression vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the necks of the people through their coueteousnesse and crueltie: now for a while the <hi>Gothes</hi> did patiently beare and lightly regarded the wrong done vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were loath, beeing but lately entered into the bounds of strangers to kindle any fire of sedition: supposing that those greedy Captaines being glutted with wealth would make an end of their oppressions. But while these coueteous wretches had little care for the distribution and prouision of victuals: they caused such a greeuous famine as was not onely a destruction to those hungry Captaines them-selues, but also to the <hi>Romaine prince,</hi> For the <hi>Gothes</hi> being assailed with pinching famine (like hungry beastes) tooke vppe their weapons hastily, killing the <hi>Romaine</hi> Captaines and their
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Guard, and then hauing armed them-selues, they range ouer all</hi> Mysia, <hi>and so from thencepasse into the nearest</hi> Thracia, <hi>which they compelled to become tributary vnto them. Here</hi> VALENS <hi>encountred them, and there was a sore and bloody battell on both sides, so that the</hi> Romaines <hi>were scattered and put to flight, and a great many of them slaughtered. The Emperour him-selfe beeing wounded was taken prisoner by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whome they burned aliue, so great was their furie after the effusion of so much</hi>
      <note place="margin">Valens the Emperor burnt aliue</note>
      <hi>blood. And then beeing proud of their victory, they march forward to</hi> Bizantium, <hi>and no repugnant forces stopping their passage, they besiege the Cittie, which held out for some space of time by her owne strength, by the industry and councell of</hi> DOMINICA, <hi>who was wife vnto</hi> VALENS: <hi>for the hartes of the Cittizens were fast vnited toward the Prince by the great bounty and liberality of</hi> DOMINICA. <hi>Afterward, the siege bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raized by the valour and power of</hi> VALENTINIANVS, <hi>brother to</hi> VALENS, <hi>they retired backe and departed.</hi> VALENTINIANVS <hi>adopted</hi> THEODOSIVS <hi>a Spaniard, sent for out of</hi> Spaine, <hi>and made him partaker of his Empire. He vanquished and putte the</hi> Gothes <hi>to the worst in many battels, compelling them to bee humble sutors for peace, which beeing graunted,</hi> HALARICVS <hi>their King comming to visite</hi> THEODOSIVS <hi>beeing sicke, fell him-selfe also into a disease, of which hee died within a few moneths after: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they any other King, or Captaine but such as the</hi> Romaine Emperor <hi>elected and appointed ouer them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>In the meane while</hi> THEODOSIVS <hi>of</hi> Millan, <hi>who was a prince without all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie equall to the rest, and inferior to none of the most renowned, as well in warre, as peaee, departed out of this life, leauing two sonnes behinde him, named</hi> ARCHADIVS <hi>and</hi> HONORIVS, <hi>and one daughter called</hi> PLACIDIA. <hi>He made</hi> ARCHADIVS <hi>gouernour ouer</hi> Byzantium <hi>and the</hi> Orientall Regiment, <hi>and</hi> HONORIVS <hi>ouer the</hi> Occidentall, <hi>and the Cittie of</hi> Rome. <hi>And because they were some-what young, hee assigned Tutors and Gardians ouer them in his Testament, for their better education: namely</hi> RVFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS <hi>ouer</hi> ARCHADIVS, <hi>and</hi> STELICO <hi>ouer</hi> HONORIVS, <hi>both of them beeing crafty and wicked wretches, and so qualified by nature, as they could easily insinuate them selues into the bosome of Princes. These two bad Protectors abusing the Minority of these Princes (beeing an age subiect to iniury) that they might increase their owne ritches and strengthen them-selues with great power; did not bend their affects to the fruition of any priuate greatnesse: but their ambitious and treacherous thoughts aymed at the highest steppe of Royall dignity.</hi> RVFFINVS <hi>coueted the Empire for him-selfe,</hi> STI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICO <hi>for his sonne. Thus both of them busied their wittes, and stretched the sinewes of their strength to satisfie their aspiring thoughtes: but they perceiued, that they could not come to the vpshotte of their desires but in the time of warre: because then the peaceable state beeing troubled, with the tempest of warre, their hatefull thoughts could not so well be discouered, and might with farre greater facility bee effected, the mindes of the Princes being perplexed with terrors of the warres, which might bee an occasion to grant any thing to men nearest vnto them, and such as should haue the chiefest command in the administration of all affaires. For they were not ignorant that in quiet time of peace (as in a fayre and calme day) the darke cloudes of their blacke mindes would soone haue beene discerned, and that punishment should with more expedition bee inflicted vppon them, the Princes and Nobles hauing leasure of consultation concerning that matter. Wherefore both of them solicite and incite the</hi> Gothes <hi>(a people ready to blow the bellowes to kindle the flame of sedition and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of war) that they would make war against their Prince, setting an edge vpon their greedy appetit with hope of a great rich booty: the</hi> Gothes <hi>supposing now that oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was their friend, so that they might do some great good for themselues: or at least (the
<pb facs="7"/>
war not attempted) returne home again with no smal prey: betooke themselues to armes, and hauing created</hi> HALARICVS <hi>to bee their King, one of their owne bodie, and of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous house of the</hi> BALTHI: <hi>depart out of their owne bounds, not without great feare and terror of those which bordered neare vnto them. And within a while after</hi> RADAGAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS <note place="margin">The house of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi.</note>
      <hi>ioyned himselfe vnto their King with two hundered thousand</hi> Gothes: <hi>and when as no one land was able to nourrish two such hugh armies, the Generalls were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to seperate their Tents, and one of them going one way, and the other another way through</hi> Panonia, Illiricum, <hi>and</hi> Noricum, <hi>they burne, and spoile all things, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in their way, and at last they come into</hi> Italy. <hi>Now</hi> RVFFINVS, <hi>foolishly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his designments, was slaine by those souldiers at</hi> Thessalonica. <hi>But</hi> STILICO <hi>more</hi>

And now</hi> RADAGAISVS <hi>was come to the</hi> Cittie of Rome <hi>with his army marching through</hi> Etruria, <hi>putting all in great feare and terror, which way soeuer hee went. The</hi> Citty of Rome <hi>troubled with exceeding feare sendeth mercenarie captaines against him at his first approch.

         </gap>isedly and rashly ordering his army, threw himselfe, as it were, head-long into places of disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. So that the multitude of his souldiers pyned, &amp; were consumed with famine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their victual, And he himselfe seeing things were come to this vnlucky euent, attempted with a small company, to escape by flight be a secret and priuate way, but hee was intercepted, and slaine by the</hi> Romane <hi>souldiers, and a great multitude of</hi> Gothes <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaisus.</hi>

      <hi>were sold at a very low rate.

   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Afterward, hee marched forward towardes them by the coast of the vpper sea, with all the forces of his horse-men and foote-men. The two armies pitch their Tents neere</hi> Rauenna, <hi>the</hi> Gothes <hi>got that part which is named</hi> Pollentia via, <hi>who in respect of their infinit number did farre exceed the</hi> Romanes: <hi>but in regard of skill, and militarie discipline, they were in no sort comparable vnto them. Now</hi> STILICO <hi>had often times gotte the vpper hand ouer the</hi> Gothes <hi>by his warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like policie, and had cooped them vppe in such a narrow place, that sitting idlie at home hee might haue ended the warres at his pleasure, if hee had beene willing. But hee resolued to remaine with his armie vntill the</hi> Vandalls <hi>his friends and fauorites were come into</hi> France. <hi>For hee was perswaded without any doubt that then good occasion would bee offered vnto him for obteyning the Empire for</hi> EVCHLRIVS <hi>his sonne.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Therefore he trifled away the time by making a few light skrmishes with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But when</hi> HALARICVS <hi>had ferrited out his hidden drift by secret passages, hee disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to</hi> HONORIVS. <hi>And when as by this good turne (as by a ritch gift) hee supposed hee should both calme the fury, and insinuate himselfe into the fauor of</hi> HONORIVS: <hi>hee was encoraged to make petition vnto him, by the same ambassadors which he sent to reueale the treason of</hi> STILICO, <hi>that hee would grant part of</hi> France <hi>vnto him for his people to inhabit there, promising that they should liue after the lawes of the</hi> Romans, <hi>to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancment of the</hi> Romane <hi>Empire, and their warres; and that they would be inferior to none of their Prouinces either in fealty, or dutifull seruice. The Emperour amazed with this doubtfull mischiefe, made choice rather to admit the</hi> Gothes <hi>into part of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion then to procure a finall destruction to him and his, by the disloyalty of perfidious</hi> STILICO.
<pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>But</hi> HALARICVS <hi>was not the first, that discouered to</hi> HONORIVS <hi>what villanie</hi> ST<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>was forging. Neuerthelesse he thought it was dangerous for him at any time to put such a man to death, as was father in law vnto him by his two wiues, beeing also so potent and mighty by his ritches farre aboue the highest degree of any priuat person. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dispatched his letters, hee sendeth them vnto</hi> STILICO <hi>by the ambassadors of the</hi> Goths, <hi>willing him without delay to permit the</hi> Goths, <hi>to haue free accesse into</hi> France. STILICO <hi>gaue but cold entertainment to this newes: for hee saw tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> he was defrauded of his great hope, and hee likewise suspected that his secret consultations some-time hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in his brest, were now divulged and dispersed into the ayre. Yet for all that, his stout, and stuborne minde made some pause vpon the matter: at last making choice of that which was safest for him, hee answered that hee would obey the commaundement of his Prince.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Neuerthelesse being loath to giue ouer so, and that the matter might not slippe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie out of his hands, hee suborneth one named</hi> SAVLVS <hi>and the souldiers of the</hi> Iewes <hi>to follow the</hi> Gothes <hi>hard at the heeles, who killing some thousands of them, oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beeing offered, might by that meanes exasperat the mindes of the people and mooue them to breake the league. Now this</hi> SAVLVS <hi>vpon the</hi> LORDS Day, <hi>which by the ancient institution of our religion wee obserue as sacred and holie: wherein the</hi> Gothes <hi>were wholie intentiue to diuine seruices: made a suddaine and violent assault against them, and in the first tumult and vprore slew some of them. The</hi> Gothes <hi>being terrified with this vnexspected accident, consult suddenlie, as well as they might, in such a sudden and fearefull case, whether they should arme themselues for their defence, or not. For they held it a haynous crime, to touch any weapons, to shedde mans bloud, to make any slaughter of men on the festiuall day of</hi> Our Sauiour. <hi>But when the furie of the</hi> Iewes <hi>was without any meane, and measure in killing, murdering and slaying, then euery priuat person following his owne minde, armed himselfe for his owne safety, attending no longer what councell might asigne them to doe. Now many of them bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed, and come together,</hi> HALARICVS <hi>hauing put his companies in arr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap> the</hi> Iewes, <hi>and put them to flight.

   <p>
      <hi>Now not long before</hi> STILICO <hi>had dismissed some of his souldiers, as men of small reckning, and of no vse but in time of warre: but by reason of the instant terror of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent daunger, hee was constrained to send to the Emperor, to haue them sent backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto him, with a new supplie of other companies, that hee might goe with all the strength they could make to withstand the enterprizes of the</hi> Gothes.

      <hi>of these two Traytors was acted at</hi> Rome <hi>in</hi> Foro Paci, <hi>in the Market place of peace. But the improuident and carclesse Emperour, after his generall was slaine, had no care to place another in his roome. I think he did it to preuent that any other hauing the like powre should attempt the like practize. So that now the army beeing destitute of a chiefe commander, was pittifully discomfited by the</hi> Gothes, <hi>who made such hauoke, and slaughther of the souldiers, that the very name of the</hi> Gothes, <hi>bred an exceeding terror and discoragement in the hearts of them all. Now the</hi> Gothes <hi>hauing put the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes <hi>to the foile, bring their bloudie ensignes to the</hi> City of Rome, <hi>and tooke the same, afflicted with a long siege, and beeing entered into the towne they beginne to rifle, ransacke and spoile it, beeing farre more greedy euery man to get a good bootie, then to commit slaughters, rapes, adulteries, and such like odious and filthy facts as are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acted by the vnbridled out-rage of dissolute souldiers, at the sacking of Cities. For when</hi> HALARICVS <hi>was ready to enter into the Citty, he caused two</hi> Edicts <hi>to bee proclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his souldiers. The one was, that euery man should abstaine from slaughter, and laying violent handes vpon any person: because such cruell deedes, did highly displease him. The other was, that whosoeuer had taken</hi> Sanctuarie <hi>in the temples of the chiefe Apostles, should haue no harme done vnto them, nor those holie temples bee prophaned by any, and that the offendor should suffer death. The</hi> City of Rome <hi>was taken by the</hi> Gothes, <hi>after it was founded</hi> Anno. M. C. L. XIIII. Cal. April. PLAVIVS, <hi>and</hi> VARRO <hi>being Consulls. But after what manner is was taken, the</hi> Historiographers <hi>make small relation.</hi> PAPT STA EGNATIVS <hi>saith, that he had the manner of the taking of it, out of the workes of</hi> PROCOPIVS <hi>a Greeke author: and that hee did not a little maruell why the</hi> Interpreter <hi>did wittingly, and willingly ouer-skippe that place: or if it were so, that hee lighted vpon an vnperfect booke, that hee tooke no better heed to marke what was wanting. I my selfe haue not seene</hi> PROCOPIVS <hi>the Greeke author, therefore the truth of the cause shall relie vpon the credit of</hi> EGNATIVS: <hi>a man verie industrious and learned, as farre as I canne iudge by his workes. These are his words ensuing.</hi> HALARICVS had now besieged <hi>Rome,</hi> the space of two yeares, when HONORIVS re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning carelesse at <hi>Rauenna</hi> was neither able, nor durst come to succor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the <hi>Citty.</hi> For hee regarded nothing lesse then the wel-fare and safety of the <hi>City,</hi> after the death of STILICO, hauing no care to place another Generall in his roome, which might haue managed the warres against the <hi>Gothes.</hi> These things were motiues to stirre vp the <hi>Gothes</hi> to besiege the <hi>Cittie,</hi> perceiuing that either the <hi>Romane</hi> souldiers daylie decaied, or that they went about their affaires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any corage. But when they found that they could not winne it by force, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing besieged it a long time in vaine: then their barbarous enemies turne their thoughts to attempt what they may doe by policy. And now they beginne to make a false shew of their departing home into their owne country, wherefore they call three hundered young men, out of their whole army, excelling in actiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body and corage of minde, which they giue as a present to the Noble-men of <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing instructed them before hand, that by their lowly carriage, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious seruice, they should bend themselues to win the fauor, and good liking of their maisters; &amp; that on a certaine day concluded betwen them, about noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when the <hi>Romane</hi> princes were either a sleepe, or idly disposed, they should come speedily to the gate, which is named <hi>Asinaria Porta,</hi> &amp; there suddenly rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the keepers, murder them speedely, and then set open the gate for their country-men to enter, beeing ready at hand. In the meane while the <hi>Gothes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed their returne, dissembling cunningly that some-time they wanted this
<pb facs="9"/>
thing, and some-time that. At last these three hundered young men wake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>il to take the tide of oportunity, dispatched their taske coragiously, which they had vndertaken, &amp;, at the appointed day set the gate wide open to their countri-men, and friends. Now the <hi>Goths</hi> hauing gotten entrance, rifle, ransack, spoile, and wast the whole City, procuring far greater dishonor, &amp; shame vnto the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, then they did losse by the taking of it. There are some which thinke the gate was set open by the meanes of PROBA, a most famous, &amp; wealthy woman, pittying the lamentable, and distressed case of the common people, who died euery where, like brute beasts, pined with famine, and afflicted with grieuous diseases.</p>
   <p>There are two things worthy of serious marking, first that HALARICVS made an Edict, that no violence or harme should be offered vnto them, which fled into the Temples of the Saints, especially of Saint PETER and PAVL, which thing was carefully kept. Next, when it was told HONORIVS being at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> was lost: hee thought it had beene meant of a certaine French-man a quarrellous, and fighting fellow whose name was ROME, maruelling that hee was so soone gone, with whom hee had so little before beene most pleasant. <hi>And thus much writeth</hi> EGNAT<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>VS.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now the most blasphemous and wicked people fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>sly imputed the cause of all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and enormities vnto the</hi> Christian Religion: <hi>denying that euer it would haue come to passe, that</hi> Rome <hi>should haue beene taken, if they had kept still the</hi> Religions <hi>deuoutly obserued by their</hi> Ancestors <hi>and commended by tradition vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>o their</hi> Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>As though the French-men before time had not taken, wasted, and ransacked that Citty, for the very same cause, namely for the breach of their oth: yea at that time when the prophane ceremonies of their Heathenish Religion (as they say) were in their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest prime, and pride. And as though few Christian Emperors had managed their affaires well, or as though the decay of the Empire and ruine of it did not begin vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of the Gentiles. And as if</hi> HONORIVS <hi>had not lost</hi> Rome, <hi>by the same negligence, and sloathfulnesse, that</hi> GALIENVS <hi>lost</hi> Aegipt, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore against these slanderous persons who would haue beene enemies, and aduersaries of the Christian Religion though no calamity had happened to them,</hi> AVGVSTINE <hi>wrote two and twenty bookes: defending the</hi> Citty of God <hi>(that is to say) the</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>against the rage, and fury of their frantick and impious calumniations.</hi>
