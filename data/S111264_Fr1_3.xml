   <head>¶ To the most excellent and learned both Orator and Poete, Mayster Gabriell Haruey, his verie special and singular good frend E. K. commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the good lyking of this his labour, and the patronage of the new Poete.</head>
   <p>VNCOVTHE VNKISTE, Sayde the olde famous Poete Chaucer: vvhom for his excellencie and vvonderfull skil in making, his scholler Lidgate, a vvorthy scholler of so excellent a maister, calleth the Loadstarre of our Language: and vvhom our Colin clout in his Aeglogue calleth Tityrus the God of shepheards, comparing hym to the worthines of the Roman Tityrus Virgile. VVhich prouerbe myne owne good friend Ma. Haruey, as in that good old Poete it serued vvell Pandares purpose, for the bolstering of his baudy brocage, so very vvell taketh place in this our nevv Poete, vvho for that he is vncouthe (as said Chaucer) is vnkist, and vnknown to most mē, is regarded but of fevv. But I dout not, so soone as his name shall come into the knovvledg of men, and his vvorthines be sounded in the tromp of fame, but that he shall be not onely kiste, but also beloued of all, embraced of the most, and vvondred at of the best. No lesse I thinke, deserueth his vvittinesse in deuising, his pithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in vttering, his complaints of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, his pastorall rudenesse, his morall vvisenesse, his devve obseruing of Decorum euerye vvhere, in personages, in seasons, in matter, in speach, and generally in al seemely simply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of handeling his matter, and framing his vvords: the vvhich of many thinges which in him be straunge, I knovv vvill seeme the straungest, the vvords them selues being so auncient, the knitting of them so short and intricate, and the vvhole Periode &amp; compasse of speache so delightsome for the roundnesse, and so graue for the straungenesse. And firste of the vvordes to speake, I graunt they be something hard, and of most men vnused. yet both English, and also vsed of most excellent Authors and most famous Poetes. In vvhom vvhenas this our Poet hath bene much traueiled and throughly redd, hovv could it be, (as that vvorthy Oratour sayde) but that vvalking in the sonne although for other cause he vvalked, yet needes he mought be sunburnt; and hauing the sound of those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poetes still ringing in his eares, he mought needes in singing hit out some of theyr tunes. But whether he vseth them by such casualtye and custome, or of set purpose and choyse, as thinking them fittest for such rusticall rudenesse of shepheards, eyther for that theyr rough sounde vvould make his rymes more ragged and rustical, or els because such olde and obsolete wordes are most vsed of country folke, sure I think, and think I think not amisse, that they bring great grace, and, as one vvould say, auctoritie to the verse. For albe amongst many other faultes it specially be obiected of Valla against Liuie, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Saluste, that vvith ouer much studie they affect antiquitie, as coueting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by credence and honor of elder yeeres, yet I am of opinion, and eke the best learned are of the lyke, that those auncient solemne wordes are a great ornament both in the one &amp; in the other; the one labouring to set forth in hys worke an eternall image of antiquitie, and the other carefully discoursing matters of grauitie and importaunce. For if my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fayle not, Tullie in that booke, vvherein he endeuoureth to set forth the paterne of a
<pb facs="3"/>
perfect Oratour, sayth that ofttimes an auncient worde maketh the style seeme graue, and as it were reuerend: no otherwise then vve honour and reuerence gray heares for a certein religious regard, which we haue of old age. yet nether euery where must old words be stuffed in, nor the commen Dialecte and maner of speaking so corrupted therby, that as <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> old buildings it seme disorderly &amp; ruinous. But all as in most exquisite pictures they vse to blaze and portraict not onely the daintie lineaments of beautye, but also rounde about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts, that by the basenesse of such parts, more excellency may accrew to the principall; for oftimes we fynde ourselues, I knowe not hovv, singularly delighted with the shewe of such naturall rudenesse, and take great pleasure in that disorderly order. Euen so doe those rough and harsh termes enlumine and make more clearly to appeare the brightnesse of braue &amp; glorious vvords. So ofentimes a dischorde in Musick maketh a comely concordaunce: so great delight tooke the worthy Poete Alceus to behold a blemish in the ioynt of a wel shaped body. But if any vvill rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame such his purpose in choyse of old and vnvvonted vvords, him may I more iustly blame and condemne, or of vvitlesse headinesse in iudging, or of heedelesse hardinesse in condemning. for not marking the compasse of hys bent, he vvil iudge of the length of his cast. for in my opinion it is one special prayse, of many vvhych are dew to this Poete, that he hath laboured to restore, as to theyr rightsull heritage such good and naturall English words, as haue ben long time out of vse &amp; almost cleare disherited. VVhich is the onely cause, that our Mother tonge, which truely of it self is both ful enough for prose &amp; stately enough for verse, hath long time ben coūred most bare &amp; barrein of both. which default when as some endeuoured to salue &amp; recure, they patched vp the holes with peces &amp; rags of other languages, borrowing here of the french, there of the Italian, euery where of the Latine, not vveighing hovv il, those tongues accorde vvith themselues, but much vvorse vvith ours: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> they haue made our English tongue, a gallimaufray or hodgepodge of al other speches. Other some no so wel seme in the English tonge as perhaps in other lan guages, if thē happen to here an olde vvord albeit very naturall and significant, crye out streight way, that we speak no English, but gibbrish, or rather such, as in old time Euāders mother spake. vvhose fitst shame is, that they are not ashamed, in their own mother tonge straungers to be counted and alienes. The second shame no lesse then the first, that what so they vnderstand not, they streight vvay deeme to be sencelesse, and not at al to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode. Much like to the Mole in Aesopes fable, that being blynd her selfe, vvould inno wise be perswaded, that any beast could see. The last more shameful then both, that of their ovvne country and natural speach, vvhich together vvith their Nources milk they sucked, they haue so base regard and bastard iudgement, that they vvill not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not labor to garnish &amp; beautifie it, but also repine, that of other it shold be embel lished. Like to the dogge in the maunger, that him selfe can eate no hay, and yet barketh at the hungry bullock, that so faine vvould feede: vvhose currish kind though cannot be kept from barking, yet I conne them thanke that they refrain from byting.</p>
   <p>Novv for the knitting of sentences, vvhych they call the ioynts and members therof, and for al the compasse of the speach, it is round vvithout roughnesse, and learned wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hardnes, such indeede as may be perceiued of the leaste, vnderstoode of the moste, but iudged onely of the learned. For vvhat in most English wryters vseth to be loose, and as it vvere vngyrt, in this Authour is vvell grounded, finely framed, and strongly trussed vp together. In regard wherof, I scorne and spue out the rakehellye route of our ragged rymers (for so thēselues vse to hunt the letter) vvhich vvithout learning boste, vvithout
<pb facs="3"/>
iudgement iangle, vvithout reason rage and some, as if some instinct of Poeticall spirite had newly rauished them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> the meannesse of commen capacitie. And being in the middest of all theyr brauery, sodenly eyther for want of matter, or of ryme, or hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten theyr former conceipt, they seeme to be so pained and traueiled in theyr remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as it were a woman in childbirth or as that same Pythia, vvhen the traunce came vpon her.</p>
   <l>Os rabidum fera corda domans &amp;c.</l>
   <p>Nethelesse let them a Gods name <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap> on theyr ovvne folly, so they seeke not to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the beames of others glory. As for Colin, vnder vvhose person the Authour selfe is shadovved, hovv <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>rre he is from such vaunted titles and glorious shovves, both him selfe sheweth, vvhere he sayth.</p>

      <q>Of Muses Hobbin. I conne no skill.</q> And
<q>Enough is me to paint out my vnrest, &amp;c.</q>
   </p>
   <p>And also appeareth by the basenesse of the name, vvherein, it semeth, he chose rather to vnfold great matter of argumēt couertly, then professing it, not suffice thereto according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. vvhich moued him rather in Aeglogues, then other wise to vvrite, doubting perhaps his habilitie, which he little needed, or mynding to surnish our tongue vvith this kinde, wherein it faulteth, or follovving the example of the best &amp; most auncient Poetes, which deuised this kind of wryting, being both so base for the matter, and homely for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the first to trye theyr habilities? and as young birdes, that be nevvly crept out of the nest, by little first to proue theyr tender vvyngs, before they make a greater flyght. So flevv Theocritus, as you may perceiue he vvas all ready full fledged. So flew Virgile, as not yet vvell feeling his vvinges So flevv Mantuane, as being not full somd. So Petrarque. So Boccace; So Marot, Sanazarus, and also diuers other excellent both Italian and French Poetes, vvhose foting this Author euery vvhere follovved; yet so as few, but they be wel sented can trace him out. So finally flyeth this our nevv Poete, as a bird, whose principals be scarce grovven out, but yet as that in time shall be hable to keepe wing with the best</p>
   <p>Novv as touching the generall dryft and purpose of his Aeglogues, I mind not to say much, him selfe labouring to conceale it. Onely this appeareth, that his vnstayed yougth had long vvandred in the common Labyrinth of Loue, in vvhich time to mitigate and allay the heate of his passion, or els to vvarne (as he sayth) the young shepheards <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls and companions of his vnfortunate folly, he compiled these xij. Aeglogues, vvhich for that they be proportioned to the state of the xij. monethes, he termeth the SHEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEARDS CALENDAR, applying an olde name to a nevv vvorke. Hereunto haue I added a certain Glosse or scholion for thexposition of old vvordes &amp; harder phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: vvhich maner of glosing and commenting, vvell I vvote, vvil seeme straunge &amp; rare in our tongue: yet for somuch as I knew many excellent &amp; proper deuises both in wordes and matter vvould passe in the speedy course of reading, either as vnknovven, or as not marked, and that in this kind, as in other vve might be equal to the learned of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I thought good to take the paines vpon me, the rather for that by meanes of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintaunce I vvas made priuie to his counsell and secret meaning in them, as also in sundry other vvorks of his. vvhich albert I knovv he nothing so much hateth, as to promulgate, yet thus much haue I aduentured vpon his frendship, him selfe being for long time furre estraunged, hoping that this vvill the rather occasion him, to put forth diuers other excellent vvorks of his, vvhich slepe in silence, as his Dreamcs, his Legendes, his Court of Cupide, and sondry others; vvhose commendations to set out, vvere verye

These my present paynes if to any they be pleasurable or profitable, be you iudge, mine ovvn good Maister Haruey, to vvhom I haue both in respect of your vvorthinesse generally, and othervvyse vpon some particular &amp; special cousiderations voued this my labour, and the mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of this our commen frends Poetrie, himselfe hauing already in the beginning dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to the Noble and vvorthy Gentleman, the right worshipfull Ma.
