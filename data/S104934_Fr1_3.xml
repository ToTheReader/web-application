   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause in most opinions of transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a most asinine error hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eare and head, that men must attempt it as a mastery in rendring any originall into other language, to doe it in as few words, and the like order; I thought it not amisse in this pore portion of translation; to pick out (like the rotten out of Apples if you please so to repute it) apoore instance or two that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to demonstrate a right in the contrary. And the rather I take this course ocularily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with example of what I esteeme fit to saue the liberty and dialect of mine owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; because there are many valetudinaries, that neuer know the goodnesse of their stomacke till they see meat afore them.</p>
   <p>Where therefore the most worthy Satyrist, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the differences of pages that attend the Lord and the guest at the table, and expresses the disdaine of the Lords page to attend his guest; he speakes for his pride thus;
<q>
         <l>— sed forma sed aetas</l>
         <l>
            <hi>digna supercilio</hi>— Which I take out with this bold one:</l>
      </q>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>And to say truth, his forme and prime beside May well alow him some few grains of pride.</hi> To speake truth, is too much, you say; I confesse it, in policy; but not in free and honest poesie. In the other, the words are vtterly altered; it should be so, to avoid verball seruitude. But the sense, I might wish my betters could render no worse. It followes: where hee sets downe the difference betwixt the Lords bread and the guests; where he hath plaid vpon the coursenesse and mustinesse of the guests pantry; he differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his Lords thus;
<q>
         <l>Sed tener &amp; niveus, mollique siligine factus,</l>
         <l>Servatur domino. <hi>Which I thus</hi>;</l>
         <l>But for his bread, the pride of appetite,</l>
         <l>Tenderly soft, incomparably white,</l>
         <l>The first flowre of fine meale subdu'd in paste</l>
         <l>That's a peculiar for my Lords owne taste.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>O this you will say is a bold one; which I am too bashfull to answere otherwise then thus, that here the purest bread affects a full description; which I amplifying no more then is needfull for the full facture of it; if I be ouerflowing, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is arid; but who would not greedily here haue falne vpon snowy? it lying so faire for him,
<pb facs="5"/>
put soft faithfully in his proper place, and would euer haue dreamed of subdu'd in paste? because it was not put in his mouth. And I hope it will seem no ouer-broad bold one, to enter where the purest bread out of industry, should make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected apparance. A number more out of this of no number, I could instance, that would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men made of greatest number to imitate. But all mastery hath his end, to get great men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. It is the outward not the inward vertue that preuailes. The candlestick more then the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is the learning with which blind fortune useth to preferre her fauorites. And who but the spawnes of candlesticks (men of most lucubration for name) winne the day from such Dormise as wake sleeping; and rest onely in those vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abhord knowledges, that no man either praises or acknowledges.</p>
