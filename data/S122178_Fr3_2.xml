   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seeme (Right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) a great presumption in mee, to haue taken in hand the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Scotish historie, and other of diuers regions, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so many sufficient men as liue in these daies, farre more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe the same. But where at the motion of a speciall friend, I vndertooke to deale therein, more vpon trust of his promised aid than of mine owne abilitie, it pleased GOD to call him to his mercie before the worke could be fullie brought to an end: but yet to answer the expectation of his friends, and trust which he had committed to them and me in this behalfe, I haue doone my good will to accomplish part of that, which in his life time was intended, although not to my wished desire, by reason of such wants as had beene supplied if he had liued to haue seene it published himselfe.</p>
   <p>It resteth (right noble Earle) that it may please your Honor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my dooings in good part, to whom I offer this parcell of my trauels in this historie of Scotland, in regard of the honor due to your noble father, for his incomparable valure well knowne and approoued, as well within that realme as else-where in seruice of two kings of most famous memorie, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the eight</hi> &amp; <hi>Edward the sixt,</hi> sounding so greatlie to his renowme, as the same cannot passe in silence, whilest any remembrance of those two most peerelesse princes shall remaine in written histories. I therefore most humblie beseech your Honor, to beare with my boldnesse in presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="28" facs="277"/>
you with so meane a gift, proceeding from one, although vnknowen to your Lordship, yet not without experience of your bountifull goodnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards those, to whome I reckon my selfe most beholden. As what is he within this realme almost of anie degree, which findeth not himselfe bounden to your Honor, either in his owne causes or his friends? For such is your inclination to pleasure all men, as the same may seeme a peculiar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue planted in your noble heart, mouing you so much to delight therein, as no time is thought by your Honor better spent, than that which you employ in dooing good to others.</p>
   <p>But least I should enter into so large a discourse, as might be framed of this and other your excellent vertues (a matter far exceeding my simple knowledge) I will ceasse to speake further thereof, sith the same is spread ouer all, aswell this as other regions: for no where doo want great numbers of such as haue abundantlie tasted of your exceeding courtesies. In making you owner therefore of this abstract of the Scotish histories, I most humblie beseech your Honor, if anie thing be amisse, to impute the same to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and defect of better instructions, and with your benigne and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable interpretation to haue me therein excused. Such as it is, I addresse it to your good Lordship with so dutifull a mind as may be imagined, beseeching God to preserue your Honor with plentifull increase of wisedome, vertue, and all wishfull prosperitie.</p>
