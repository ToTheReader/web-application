   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a true saying, that the <hi>lives of some men are like a long vacation:</hi> I cannot altogether excuse my selfe of some fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse vacancies, and do therfore sincerely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my selfe a debtor to the Common
<pb facs="3"/>weale: yet upon the occasion of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment by a very worthy friend <hi>Thom. Hughes Esquire,</hi> in the County, where I live, upon the execution of his Majesties Commission addressed into that, and other severall Counties for the discovery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a monstrous and growing evill, Depopulation; this small treatise, by my slender labours of the last long vacation, had its conception, birth, and being. A little creature it is, and though it hath obteyned license to walke abroad into the world, yet it cannot be bould without the protection of authority to adventure into the hands of this age for feare of crushing. As under his Royall Majesty, and his most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privy Councell, it properly apperteyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the eminent trust of your place to provide for the discovery, and prepare for the suppression of such, and the like oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
<pb facs="3"/>(wherein your faithfull care, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy hath beene sufficiently remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) so is it most proper for your worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to patronize the labours of any well affected Subject in this kinde from the spurnings and tramplings of the grander sort of delinquents. To you therfore Right worshipfull, this little <hi>one</hi> doth humbly present it selfe, and earnestly implores your favourable patronage &amp; safe conduct to be vouchsafed to it, wherewith being incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it will not feare the face of any greedy and grinding <hi>Achabs</hi> or <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the times, it will modestly presume to tell those peop e how injurious they are to his highnesse royall State in the diminution of his people, in the multitude of whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the honour of a Prince, as also in the lessening of his revenewes: It will tel them, how sacrilegious they are to the Church and
<pb facs="4"/>painfull ministery: how pernitious they are to the Common weale, and what wretched starvers they are of all sorts of poore: The criminous actors in this mischiefe have spread themselves throughout all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Kingdom, and have scattered and dispersed the many samples of their worst actions, as the Levite did the twelve parts of his Concubine <hi>per omnes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minos,</hi> through all the quarters of Israel. I might more aptly say that his Majesty hath dealt in justice with this crying crime, as the Levite did in the case of his dead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, with the <hi>Gibeathites.</hi> He dispersed her <hi>membratim,</hi> by pieces and morsels, aswell for a shame, a byword, and a parable against the unruly actors in that tragedy, with a <hi>nunquam res talis facta est in Israel:</hi> As also to summon a generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for the just destruction of them; This
<pb facs="4"/>only puts the difference; there was then no King in Israel. Blessed be God, we have a blessed King over our Israel, who (not for destruction) for reformation of oppressing Depopulators hath by his gratious directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his honourable Iudges circuiting all the quarters of his Kingdom, seconded with his carefull Commissions, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences insuing therupon, indeavoured to distribute all parts of Royall justice in <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes terminos Israelis;</hi> And as the offence of late time hath growne so monstrous, as never was it so great, nor so exemplary in its evill in any former age: So the unpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terned proceeding in proportionable Iustice by his Majestie, and his right honourable Counsell, doth justly meet with it: <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam res talis facta est in Israel;</hi> Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as in other things your prudent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident care neither hath been, nor is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb facs="5"/>And that it may long continue, and increase with length of happie and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dayes, he, who beggeth pardon for this presumption, will not faile to offer up his continuall prayers to Heaven.</p>
