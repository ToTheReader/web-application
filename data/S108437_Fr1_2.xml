   <head>A Declaration by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the religious and deuoute.</head>
   <p>I Haue published these Himnes and spirituall Sonnets, not in vaine affectation or osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my owne skill, which ingeniously I confesse to be but small and mediocrious: but onely in an vnfeigned affection &amp; earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the humbled hearts (together with mine) may reape profit and consolation by singing or reading of them. If thou art not skillfull in Musicke, then mayest thou read them or sing them in the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie tunes beseeming such a subiect: But for them who either delight in Melodious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or else are themselues skillfull in Pricksong, I intend (God willing) likewise to divuldge very speadely in print, some sweete Musicall Ayres and Tunable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, whereof some of the plainest sort are mine owne Ayres and the rest are done by expert and famous learned men in that science and facultie, as hereafter in the same booke appertayning to this shalbe expressed, to which tunes all or the most part of all thiese songs, Hymnes or Sonnets are at the pleasure of all those that delight in Musique, to be sung or plaid, as shalbe most pleasing vnto them.</p>
