To add to Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> I know is rashnesse; a fault pardonable in me, if custome might as well excuse the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as youth may prescribe in offending in this kinde. That he should undergo that burden, whose mother tongue differs as much from this language, as <hi>Irish</hi> from <hi>English</hi>; augments the danger of the enterprise, and gives your expectation perhaps an assurance what the event must be. Yet let no man judge wrongfully of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: I have added a limme to <hi>Apelles</hi> picture; but my minde never entertain'd such vaine hopes, to thinke it of perfection sufficient to delude the eyes of the most vulgar, with the likenesse in the workmanship. No, no, I doe not follow <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his opinion of transmigrations: I am well assur'd divine <hi>Sidney's</hi> soule is not infus'd into me, whose Iudgment was only able to finish, what his Inventiō was only worthy to undertake For this, courteous Reader, let it suffice I place Sir <hi>Philip Sidney's</hi> desert (even in mine owne esteeme) as farre beyond my endevours, as the most fault-finding censor can imagin this assay of mine, to come short of his <hi>Arcadia.</hi>
