   <p>AS our men do more willingly go to warfare / and fyght with greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage agaynst straungers / then agaynst theyr countreymen: so it is with me in thys spirituall warfare. For I would haue wyshed that thys contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy had bene with the Papystes / or with other (if any can be) more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stylent and professed ennemyes of the church: for that should haue bene les griefe to wryte / and more conuement to perswade that which I desire. For as the very name of an ennemy doth kyndle the desire of fyghting / and stirreth vp the care of preparing the furniture for the warre: So I can not tell how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe / that the name of a brother staketh that courage / and abateth that carefulnes which should be bestowed in desence of the truth. But seeing the truth ought not to be forsaken for any mans cause / I enforced my selfe / considering that if the Lord myght lay it to my charge / that I was not for certayne conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations so ready as I ought to haue bene to publyshe the truth / he myght more iustly condemne me / if being oppugned and slaundered by others / I should not according to that measure which he hath dealte vnto me / and for my small haby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie defend it / and delyuer it from the euill report that some endeuor to bring vpon it. And as vnto other partes of the gospell / so sone as the Lord openeth a dore for them to enter in / there is for the most part great resistance: so in thys part concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the gouernment and dyscipline of the church / which is the order which God hath left / as well to make the doctryne most effectuall / and to geue as it were a sharper edge vnto the preaching of the word / as also to be a wall to keepe it / and make it contynue among vs / I see there be sondry lettes / which doe as it were with weapons stande vp to stoppe the passage / and to hynder that it should not be setled amongst vs. With the which albeit I wrastle hande to hande in thys booke / yet for as much as we haue all dronke so deepe of the cuppe of vntruth / that we do not only stumble at blockes / which other men lay in our way / but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes we gather lettes vnto our selues in framyng a preiudice agaynst the truth: I thought good to note shortly what those stumbling blockes are / and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I can not remoue them / yet to geue warning of them / and to lende my hand to the weaker and simpler sort to helpe to ouerstride them.</p>
   <p>The offences which are taken herein / be eyther in respect of the cause / or in respect of those / which seeke to defend / and promote the cause. The cause is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged first with newnes / and strangenes / then as author of confusion / and of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / and last of all as enemy to princes / magistrates / and common wealthes. For the first / besides that it is no sufficient chalenge / to say it is new &amp; strange / there is no cause why it should be counted new / which is confessed of those which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke it / to haue bene for the most part / vsed in the Apostles tymes / nor why it should be esteemed straunge / which is vsed now farre / and neare / of thys &amp; that side the sea / and of no strangers / but of those which are of the housholde of fayth. And it shall more largely appeare in thys Booke / that thys is no innouation / but a renouation / and the doctrine not new / but renued / no stranger / but borne in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / whereunto (it being before vniustly banyshed) ought now of ryght to bee restored.</p>
   <p>And of confusion &amp; dysorder it is yet more vntruely accused. For iustice may be as well accused for doing wrong / as thys doctryne / for bringing in disorder / whose whole worke is to prouyde / that nothing be done out of place / out of time / or otherwise / then the condytion of euery mans calling will beare: which putteth the people in subiection vnder their gouernoures / the gouernoures in degree / and
<pb n="2" facs="4"/> order one vnder an other / as the Elder / vnderneath the Pastor / and the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con / vnderneath the Elder / whych teacheth / that a Particuler church / shall giue place vnto a Prouinciall synode / where many churches are / and the Prouincial / to a Nationall / and likewyse that / vnto the Generall / if anye be / and all vnto Christe / and his worde. When on the contrary parte / those whych stand against thys doctrine / are thereby compelled to bryng into the church great confusion / and maruellous disorder / whilest the pastors office is confounded wyth the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons / whilest women do minister the sacraments / whych is lawful only for men: whilest priuate men do that / whych belongeth vnto publicke persons: whilest publicke actions / are done in priuate places: whilest the church / is shuffled wyth the common wealth: whilest ciuill matters / are handled by Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons / and Ecclesiasticall / by those whych be ciuill: and to be short / whilest no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the church keepeth his standing / and one member doth take vpon it / the office of an other. Which things as they hazard the arme / and destroy the body: so they do presently hinder / and will shortly (if remeady be not prouided) vtterly ouerthrowe the churche. And therefore onles good order be in that whych was brought into the church by poperye / and confusion in that whych was left vnto the church by the Apostles / and that it be order / that publike actions / should be done in priuate places / by priuate persons / and by women / that is appoynted to be done by men / and confusion / when the contrary is obserued / and finally / onles order / haue an other definition or nature / then hitherto hath bene read / or heard of / there is no cause / why this doctrine which containeth the discipline / and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the churche / should be thus shamefully slaundered wyth confusion / and disorder.</p>
   <p>For the third poynt / whych is / that it is an enemy to magistrates / and the common wealth: if it be enough to accuse wythout proufe / to say and shewe no reason / innocency it selfe shall not be giltles. Thys doctrine was in times past / euen by their confession / which wryte against it / a friend vnto princes and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates / when princes / and magistrates were enemies vnto it: and can it nowe be an enemy vnto princes / and magistrates / whych are frendes vnto it? It helped / and vpholded the common wealths / whych were gouerned by tyrantes / and can it hinder those / whych are gouerned by godly princes? And in what is it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to princes / and magistrates? Note the variance / set downe the enemitie. If the question be / whether princes / and magistrates be necessary in the church / it holdeth / that the vse of them / is more then of the sunne / wythout the whych the world cā not stand. I fit be of their honor / it holdeth / that wyth humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nussion of minde / the outward also of the body / yea the body it selfe / and all that it hath / if nede so require / are to be yelded / for the defence of the prince / and for that seruice / for the whych the prince will vse them vnto / for the glory of God / and maintenance of the common wealth. If it be asked of the obedience due vnto the prince / and vnto the magistrate / it answeareth that all obedience in the Lord / is to be rendred: and if it come to passe / that any other be asked / it so refuseth / that it disobayeth not / in preferring obedience to the great God / before that whych is to be geuen to mortall man. It so resisteth / that it submitteth the body / and goodes of those that professe it / to abide that whych God will haue them suffer in that case. And if it be shewed / that this is necessary for the church / it can not be / but profitable for the common wealth: nay the profit of it / may easly appeare / for that by the censures / and discipline of the church / as they are in thys booke described / men are kept back from committing of great disorders of stealing / adultry / mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. &amp;c. whilest the smallest faultes of lying / and vncomely iesting / of harde and cholericke speaches / whych the magistrate doth not commonly punishe / be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. And vndoubtedly / seeing that the church / &amp; common wealth / do embrace / and kisse one an other / and seeing / they be like vnto Hypocrates twinnes / whych
<pb n="3" facs="4"/> were sicke togither / and well togither / laughed togither / and weeped togither / and alwayes like affected: it can not be / but that the breaches of the common wealth / haue proceeded from the hurtes of the church / and the wants of the one / from the lackes of the other. Neyther is it to be hoped for / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the common wealth shall flourishe / vntill the church be reformed. And it is also certaine / that as the church shall euery day more / and more decay / vntill it be made eauen wyth the ground / onles the walles be builded / and the ruines repaired: so the weight of it (if it fall) will eyther quite pull downe the common wealth / or leaue it suche / as none whych feare God / will take any pleasure in it. For seing Salomon sayth / y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <note place="margin">Prouer. 8. 15.</note> by wisdom (whych is the word of God) kings do gouerne / and princes do beare rule / it can not be / but as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wisdome is either contemned / neglected / or otherwise abridged of hir free and full course / so princes / and magistrates / and consequently their common wealthes / either goe to wracke / or decay / or at the least / want so much of their flourishing estate / as there wanteth of that worde of God / which he hath appoynted to be their stay. And howsoeuer (before the comming of our sauioure Christ) amongst the Athenians / Lacedemonians / and Romanes / and since hys comming in diuers places / where thys wisedome hath not bene heard of / there may seme to haue bene some shewes of either florishing / or tollerable cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes / yet neither haue those endured / but according to the prophesye of * Daniel / haue bene broken all to peeces: so that there is not so much of them left / <note place="margin">2. Chap. 34.</note> as a sheerde to fetche fire in / neither yet can those kingdomes / whych haue the knowledge of the gospel reuealed vnto them / loke for that long suffering / and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience of God towardes them / wherewith these ignorant kingdomes haue bene borne with. For as the benefite is greater towardes these / then towardes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / so is the iudgement swifter agaynste them / then againste the other / if that grace which was not offred vnto them (being offered vnto these) be refused / and made light of. And in these especially is / &amp; shall be fulfilled / that whych the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet * Esay sayeth / that it shalbe in the later dayes / that euery nation and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">60. chap. 12.</note> whych shall not serue the church shalbe destroyed / as of the other side / the full / and whole placing of our sauior Christ in his throne / is the perpetuall stay / and stayed perpetuitie of all princes in their seats. And therfore / if this boke shal come / into the hands of any / that haue accesse vnto her maiestie / the head of this cōmon wealth / or vnto her most honorable counsel / the shoulders therof / my hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sute / and hearty request / in the presence of God is / that according as their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings will suffer them / they will put them in remembrance of these things / whych otherwise they know better then I / and that they would set before them / the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Moses / who was not contented to haue brought the people out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt / <note place="margin">3. Deut. 25.</note> but would very faine also / haue conducted them into the land of Canaan: that is / would gladly haue bene the instrument / of the ful / and whole deliuerance of the people. And seeing that the Lord doth offer vnto them this honor / which he denied vnto his seruaunt Moses / that they would not make themselues gilty of so great vnthankfulnes / as wil folow of the forsaking of so incomparable a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite. That her maiestie especially / and her most honourable counsaile / wold set before them the example of * Dauid / who although he made a great reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / <note place="margin">2. Samu. 7. 2. Psal. 132.</note> of those things whych were defaced by Saule / yet he was not content / that the Arke of the Lord / should dwell vnder a tabernacle / and therfore desired mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously / that he might build the temple vnto the Lord. And seeing that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord hath graunted that vnto them which he denyed vnto his seruaūt / that they wold not be narow / and straight in them selues / seeing the Lord openeth the treasures of hys goodnes so largely vnto them. That they would set before them / the zeale of * Zerubbabel / who although he had (after the returne out of captiuitie) aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <note place="margin">Esra. 3. 3. 10.</note> idolatry / laid the foundations of the temple / and set vp an altare vnto god / whervpon the morning and euening sacrifice was daily made: yet being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="4" facs="5"/> by the Prophet Aggey / that God woulde not be pleased / vnles the temple <note place="margin">Agg. 1. 14.</note> also were fully buylded / dyd (all feare of the nations rounde about / and other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synesses laid aside) cause it forthwith / and with all possyble speede / to be made an ende of. Finally / that it would please them / to consider the examples of * Iosias / <note place="margin">2. kin. 22. 23. 2. kin. 18. 2. Chr. 17.</note> * Ezechias / and * Iehoshaphat / who are therfore / to their euerlasting commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation praysed / of the holy ghost / for that / they made whole / &amp; through reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions / whereas the honor of other some (albeit they were otherwise good) is stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / and caryeth the marke of their imperfection / by this and like exception / that although they did such good things / and such / yet they left also such / &amp; such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Which I do not speake / as though we had not already / by her maiesty es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially / and afterwarde by their honors handes / receiued a singuler benefite / but that we hauing the whole / might haue our hearts / and mouthes filled wyth the prayse of God / and continue the possession of that whych we haue / which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for our vnthankfull refusall / shall be taken away. Wherin as we haue espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regarde / that the name of God shoulde be magnified / not by vs alone / but by our posterity to the worldes end: so is it not the smallest part of our care / that her maiestie / and your honoures / to whom we are so depely bound / and of whom we haue receiued so singuler benefits of peace / and preaching of the gospel / myght with your successions continue / and flourish amongst vs for euer. But the desire of reformation / and feare of Gods heauy wrath to come vpon vs / hath caried me further heerein / then I purposed. I will therfore make an end of these poynts / considering that the vntruth of these accusations of newnes and straungenes / of disorder and confusion / of being ennemy to princes and common wealthes / shall better appeare in the discourse of thys boke.</p>
   <p>Emongst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> offences taken by occasion of those / which prefer this doctrine / this is the chefest / that comparison being made betwene those excellent men / both in vertue / and learning / which suffered for the testimony of the truthe / &amp; betwene vs / of the one side: Also betwene the Archbishops / Bishops / Deanes / &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons whych now are / and vs on the other side: it seemeth vnto many / that it is not lyke to be good / whych was not founde out by those excellent personages / and whych being now propounded / by men of no great shew / is eyther misliked / or at the least / by no open approbation alowed / of those whych cary greater coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces / and be in greater dignities.</p>
   <p>Vnto the first / although answer is made more at large / in this boke / yet I wil adde thus much / that as for my part / I confes my self / to be a great deale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior vnto the least of them: so the omitting of these necessary things / ought to be no more preiudice against them / or against those that prefer them / then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> omitting of the celebration of the feast of tabernacles / so many hundreth yeres / by so many good high priests / in the raignes of so many good kings / was preiudicial vnto y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ministers / which caused it to be celebrated / when the people returned out of their captiuitie / for it appeareth in the boke of Nehemias / that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feast of tabernacles / <note place="margin">8 Chap. 17. 18</note> which was commaunded of the Lord to be celebrated euery yeare / was not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in such sort / as it was commaunded in the law / from the dayes of Iosua / the sonne of Nun / vntill the returne of the people from their captiuitie. And yet were there / in this space / diuers bothe iudges / and kings / both priestes / and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets singularly zealous / and learned. If therfore the omitting of so necessary a thing / so many hundreth yeares / by suche godly zealous learned persons / could not bring any prescription / against the truth: the lacke of this necessary discipline / by the space of. 30. yeares / through the ouersight of a fewe (if they be compared with that multitude) ought not to be alledged / to kepe it out of the church.</p>
   <p>The dignitie also / and hygh estate of those / whych are not so earnest in thys cause / can not hinder it / if we consider / the wisdome of God / almost from time to time / to consist / and to shew it selfe most in setting forth his truth / by the simpler / 
<pb n="5" facs="5"/> and weaker sort / by contemptible / and weake instruments / by things of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue / to the end / that when all men see the basenes / and rudenes of the instrumēt / <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 27. 28</note> they might the more wonder at the wisedome / and power of the artificer / which wyth so weake / and foolishe instruments / bringeth to passe so wise / and mighty things. And if men will wyth such an eye of fleshe / loke vpon matters / they shall condemne that excellent reformation / vnder the godly king Ezechias / whych the holy ghost doth so highly commend: in whych it is witnessed / that the Leuites / <note place="margin">2. Chro. 29. 34 2. Chr. 30. 17.</note> whych were a degree vnder the priests / were more forward / and more zealous / then the priests them selues. Yea wherin it is witnessed / that the people were yet more earnest / and more willing / then either the Leuites / or the priestes. Whych thing / if euer / is verified in our time. For when I consider the zeale for religion / whych sheweth it selfe / in many / as well of the nobility / and gentry of this realme / as of the people / their care to continue it / and aduaunce it / their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary charges to maintaine it / their liberality towards them / which bend them selues that way / as I do therby conceiue some hope / of the fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce / and continuance of Gods goodnes towards vs: so I can not be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of mine owne slackenes / and afraid of the displeasure of the Lord / for that those / whose proper worke thys is especially / and whych should beare the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darde / and cary the torche vnto the rest / are so colde / and so careles in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord.</p>
   <p>And I humbly craue / and most earnestly desire of those / whych beare the cheefe titles in the Ecclesiasticall functions / that as we doe in parte correct oure negligence / by the example of the forwardnes / and readines of the people: so they would suffer themselues / to be put in remembrāce of their dueties / by vs / which are vnderneath them / and that they would not neglect thys golden gift of Gods grace / in admonishing them / because the Lord doth offer it in a treene / or earthen vessell / but that they would first consider / that as * Naaman the Syrian prince / <note place="margin">2. Kin. 5. 4. 14</note> receiued great commodity / by following / the aduise of his maide / and after / of his man: And * Abigael being a wise woman / singuler profit / by obeying the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 18</note> of her seruaunt: so they may receiue oftentimes profitable aduertisement / by those / whych are in lower places then they them selues be. Then let them thynke that as Naaman was neuer the les noble / for obeying the voyce of his seruaūts / nor Abigaell neuer the les wise / because she listened vnto the words of her man / so it can not deminishe their true honoure / nor empaire the credite of their godly and vncounterfait wisdome / if they geue care vnto that / which is spoken by their inferioures.</p>
   <p>And last of all / that as / if they had not listened vnto those simple persons / the one had pearished in his leprosie / the other had bene slaine with her familye: euen so / if they shall for any worldly respect of honor / riches / or feare of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted eyther vnaduised in taking this course / or light / or inconstāt in forsaking it / stop their cares against thys louing Admonition of the Lorde / they prouoke hys anger / not against their health / or against their life / but against their owne soules / by exercising of vnlawfull authority / and by taking vnto them partly such things / as belong by no meanes vnto the church / and partly whych are common vnto them / wyth the whole church / or els wyth other the ministers / and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the same / wherof I beseche them humbly to take the better hede / for that the iudgement of the Lord wil be vpon a great part of them / by so much the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier / by how much / they haue not only beleued the gospel / but also haue receyued this grace of God / that they should suffer for it. So that if they wil neither take example of diuers their superiors the nobles of this realme / nor be admonished by vs of the lower sort (wherin we hope better of them) yet they would remember their former times / and correct them selues / by them selues. And seing they haue ben content for the gospels sake / to quit y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> necessary things of this life / they wold
<pb n="6" facs="6"/> not thinke much / for the discipline / whych is no small parte of the gospel (hauing both things necessary and commodious) to part from that / whych is not only in them superfluous / and hath nothing but a vaine ostentation (whych will vanish as the shadow) but also is hurtfull vnto them / and pernicious vnto the churche / whych thing I do morelargely / and plainly lay forth in thys boke.</p>
   <p>Another exception against the fauorers of this cause / is taken / for that they propoūd it out of time / whych is that the Iewes sayd / that the time was not yet come to build the Lordes house: but it is knowen / what the * Prophet answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">1. Agg. 234.</note> And if no time were vnseasonable / in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kinde of materiall building / wherin there be some times (as of summer) more opportune and fit then others: howe can there be any vntimely building / in this spirituall house / where as long / as it is called to day / men are commaunded to further thys worke. And as for those which say we come to late / and that this shuld haue bene done in the beginning / and cannot now be done / wythout the ouerthrow of all / for mending of a peece: they do little consider / that * S. Paul compareth that which is good in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 12. 13</note> vnto gold / and siluer / and precious stones / and that whych is euil layd vpon the foundation / vnto stubble / and hey / and wode. Likewise therfore / as the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the hey / and the wode be easely by the fire consumed / wythout any losse vnto the gold / or siluer / or precious stones: so the corrupt things in this building / may be easely taken away / wythout any hurt / or hinderance vnto that which is pure / and found. And if they put such confidence in thys similitude / as that they wil therby / wythout any testimony of the word of God / stay y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> further building / or correcting the faultes of the house of the Lorde (whych by his manifest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ought to be done wyth all spede) then besides that they be very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunning builders / whych can not mende the faultes / wythout ouerthrow of all / (especially when as the fault / is not in the foundation) they must remembre / that as the meane / whych is vsed to gather the children of God / is called a building / so is it called a planting. And therfore as dead twigs / riotous / and superfluous braunches / or whatsoeuer hindreth the groweth of the vine tree / may be cut of / wythout roting vp the vine: so the vnprofitable things of the church / may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away / without any ouerthrow of those things / which are well established. And seeing that Christ / and Beliall can not agree / it is straunge / that the pure <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 15.</note> doctrine of the one / &amp; the corruptions of the other / should cleaue so fast togither / that pure doctrine / can not be wyth her safetie / seuered from the corruptions / when as they are rather like vnto that part of Daniels image / which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">Cap. 2. 42. 43.</note> of clay and iron / &amp; therfore could not cleaue / or sticke one with an other.</p>
   <p>It is further sayde / that the setters forwarde of thys cause / are contentious / and in mouing questions / giue occasion to the papists of slaundring the religion / and to the weake of offence. But if it be found to be both true which is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / and a thing necessary about which we contende / then hath thys accusation no grounde to stande on. For peace is commended to vs / with these conditions / * if <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> it be possible / if it lye in vs. Now it is not possible / it lyeth not in vs / to conceale the truth / * we can do nothing agaynst it / but for it. It is a prophane saying / of <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 8. 2. Cor. 13. 8.</note> a prophane man / that an vniust peace / is better then a iust warre. It is a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine saying / of an Heathen man / <hi>Agathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>d eris hede brotoisi:</hi> It is good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende for good thinges. The papistes haue no matter of reioysing / seeing they haue greater / and sharper controuersies at home / and seing thys tendeth / both to to the further opening of theyr shame / &amp; thrusting out of theyr remnantes / which yet remayne among vs. The weake may not be offended / considering (y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> euen in the church of God / and among those of the church) there hath bene as great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of iudgementes / as these are. For what waightier controuersyes can there be / then whether we shall ryse agayne or no / whether circumcision were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be obserued of those which beleued? And yet the first / was amongst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church
<pb n="7" facs="6"/> of the * Corinthes / the other was first in * Ierusalem and Antioche / and after in <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. Act. 15. 1. 2 Gal. 3. 3.</note> the churches of * Galatia / and yet they the churches / and that the true relygion / which was there professed. And it is to be remembred / that these controuersyes for the most part / are not betwene many. For sondry of those thinges / which are comprehended in the answere to the Admonition / haue (as I am perswaded) few fauourers / of those especially / which are of any stayed / or sounder iudgement in the scriptures / and haue sene / or red of the gouernment / and order of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: so that in deede (the father of that answere excepted) we haue thys contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy oftentymes / rather with the papistes / then with those which professe the gospell / as we do. And whereas last of all / it is sayde / that thys procedeth of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy / of singularitie / and of popularitie / although these be no sufficient reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the truth of the cause / which is neyther enuyous / singular / nor popular / and althoughe they be suche / as myght be seuerally / by great lykelyhodes / and probalyties refuted / yet because the knowledge of these thinges / pertayneth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God which is the searcher of the hart and raynes / and for auoyding of too <note place="margin">Act. 1. 24.</note> muche tediousnesse / we will rest in his iudgement / tary for the day wherein the secretes of hartes shall be made manyfest. And yet all men do see / how vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we be accused of singularity / which propound nothing / that the scriptures do not teache / the wryters bothe olde / and new for the most part affirme / the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the primitiue churches / and of those which are at these dayes confirme.</p>
   <p>All these accusations / as well agaynst the cause / as the fauourers thereof / al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be many and dyuers / yet are they no other / then which haue bene long sithens in the Prophets / Apostles / and our sauior Christes / and now of late in our tymes obiected agaynst the trueth / and the professors therof. And therefore / as the sunne of the truth then appeared / &amp; brake through all those cloudes / which rose agaynst it / to stoppe the lyght of it: so no doubt thys cause / being of the same nature / will haue the same effect. And as all those slaunders could not bryng the truth in disgrace / with those that loued it: so the children of the truth / through these vntrue reportes / will neyther leaue the loue of thys cause / which they haue already conceaued: nor yet cease to enquire dyligently / and to iudge indifferently / of those surmises / which are put vp agaynst it.</p>
   <p>Moreouer / seing that we haue once ouercomed all these lets / and clymed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them / when they were cast in our way / to hynder vs from coming from the grosse darknes of popery / vnto the gloryous lyght of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospell: there is no cause / why now they should staye our course to further perfection / considering / that neyther the style is hygher nowe / then it was before (being the very selfe same obiections) and in all thys tyme / we ought so to haue growne in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth / that in stead of being then able to leape ouer a hedge / we should now haue our feete so prepared by the gospell / that they should be as the fecte of a hynde / hable to surmount euen a wall if neede were.</p>
   <p>The summe of all is: that the cause may be looked vpon with a single eye / without all miste of partialitie / may be heard with an indifferent care / without the waxe of preiudice: the argumentes of both sides / may be waighed / not with the chaungeable waightes of custome / of tyme / of men / which notwithstanding (Popishe excepted) shall be shewed to be more for the cause then agaynst it: but with the iust balances of the incorruptible / and vnchangeable worde of God.</p>
   <p>And I humbly beseeche the Lord / to encrease in vs the spirite of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge / and iudgement: that we may discerne thinges which differ one from an other / and that we may be syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere / and wythout offence / vntill the day of Christ.</p>
