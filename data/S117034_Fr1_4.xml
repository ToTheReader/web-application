      <hi>I</hi> Lately met with that Conference which I had with you in the <hi>Tilt-boat,</hi> printed; wherein I found my selfe much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, in the Answere you put out in my name; and that which you say much mended, and deliuered to the best aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I found also a Dedication fixed to the Front of your Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, as if you meant to make your best friend sharer of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you atchieued by the supposed victorie ouer mee. In all which regard, I could not but take notice of your falshood; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="5"/> because I saw you did not onely wrong mee, by concealing what I said, and affirming what I neuer sayd, but laboured also to wrong the cause, through the weaknesse of my person. Lest therefore any of my Countrimen should bee wonne by your cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to thinke better of your Cause, and worse of ours, then they would, and reason requires; and so bee easily wooed to leaue vs, to seeke and finde repentance with you, I haue incerted what I sayd, or might haue sayd to your emptie allegations; and likewise haue dedicated my indeuours to a worthy Commander; who is not (as yours commonly are) a Souldier Swallow-like for a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer onely, or a siege, but whose very name is famous thorow your Armie, and his person knowne to all of yours, that for almost these thirtie yeeres past haue seene an English Enemie in the Field or Trenches: In either of which place if you dare meet me. I will make good vpon your person with Sword and Pistoll, what here I subscribe with my Pen, that you haue wronged me, the truth, and your selfe, if you had any honour to lose by lying.</p>
