The vse of which iewel, is so aboundant and ample, that it leadeth any man practising thereon, the direct pathway ... through the whole artes of astronomy, cosmography, ... and briefely of whatsoeuer concerneth the globe or sphere: ... The most part newly founde out by the author, compiled and published ... by Iohn Blagraue of Reading gentleman and well willer to the mathematickes, who hath cut all the prints or pictures of the whole worke with his owne hands. 1585</title>

   <head>The conclusion.</head>
   <p>THus gentle Reader, an hundred times heartily farewel, beeing sorye that my other 6. litle bookes of the <hi>Iewel</hi> be not ready to go to the presse with these: but I hope by that time these shalbe throughly perused to send the rest after somwhat more industriously performed, I feare some will take it vnkindly that those bookes to come, being chiefly for the bent of this present time to be desired should bee kepte in. But truely I could not doe withall, except I should haue set the cart before the horse: such hath beene my want of leysure through the malice of fortune. And therefore considering I haue kept a needful order in this my woorke by passing from the lowest matters to the highest, the one to explane the other: &amp; that I haue done my vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most (as is wel knowne) that my leysure would permit, I hope I shalbe the lesse blamed.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The order of the sixe bookes behinde.</head>
      <p>THe 7. booke of the Mathematical <hi>Iewel</hi> of singuler and perfect meanes as well to describe as to deuyde the lineaments of my <hi>Iewel,</hi> as of my great quadrant to come: to performe the crosse staffe or any prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue proiection of the globe howsoeuer, and of certaine vses of the crosse staffe.</p>
      <pb n="124" facs="71"/>
      <p>The 8. booke of certayne Geometrical propositions, and of working both rectilineall and spherical trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles <hi>adminutum,</hi> most exactly.</p>
      <p>The 9. of Rectifications of fyxed starres, of Parellaxes, of comets, or of the moone, of their distances frō the earth, of getting the moones exact place by obseruation and such like.</p>
      <p>The 10. of Cosmography, Geography, Topography, mensurations, distances, and such like.</p>
      <p>The 11. of the Theoricks of the Sun and moone, and setting, their <hi>Radices</hi> of the longitude of regions, and of nauigation.</p>
      <p>The 12. of making all manner of dialles Geometrically for artifycers or any other that woulde not enter into the studie of Astronomy, so exceeding easie, that the like hath not (I presume) beene written in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
      <p>And in all these wil stil keep me to the vse of my <hi>Iewel,</hi> except it be where I must perforce vse my great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant and crosse staffe, to pearce vnto the exact proofe of thinges</p>
      <p>This figure must stand in the 6. booke 19. chap. and the figure whiche you see placed in the same 19. chap. must be placed topsie turuie according to the wordes zenith and Nadir in the beginning of the 20. chap.</p>
