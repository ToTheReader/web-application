Christian to take vnto him <hi>vniuersam

      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 13.</note> that same compleat
armour of a godly man, willeth him
to girde himselfe with the girdle of
truth. This truth seemeth to haue
great affinitie with mans nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee are made after Gods owne
image, (who is truth it selfe) that wee might expresse the
same in our life, in our words, and in our maners. But by
reason of original sinne, we all haue made shipwracke of
the truth, &amp; euerie man is become a liar. Yet, what man
is he so vnregenerate, that in open shew seemeth not to
like and loue truth? Doe not the greatest liers and most
false accusers pretend truth? Celsus and Antiphon, two
heretiques, called their bookes, Bookes of truth. The
false Prophets which deceiued Achab, made a great brag
of truth. The deuill (who can transforme himselfe into an
Angel of light) when he tempted Christ, had in his mouth
the infallible truth of Gods word. But Prosper sayth very
well, <hi>Parum est, si verum in ore est, et falsum in corde.</hi> And an
other father to the same purpose saith: <hi>Nihil prodest, quia
hymnum cantat lingua tua si sacrilegium exhalat vita tua.</hi> It
is a verie vile thing to haue truth in the mouth, and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in the heart. A theefe many times is not knowen
by his face from a true man. Experience proueth, that as
poisoning hearbes do grow greene as well as the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
And as counterfait golde looketh to the eie so
faire as good coine: so doth falsehoode appeare often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like the truth, yea to some, more plausible and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.
For art and science, which should serue for the
truth, are by the subteltie of sathan verie often retayned
against the same.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>The wisest creature among beasts (the serpent I meane)
was by the deuil abused to set forth lies, to the seducing
of the first man. And do we not see that the same deuill
imploieth still art, learning, ripe wittes, and other good
gifts which God hath giuen vnto men, against the truth?
to wit, such as are in the Papists, Heretiques, Brownists,
the familie of Loue, Martinistes, and all Schismatiques,
which neuer cease peruerting the truth? It were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
that the lips of these men might be continually sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as was the mouth of the image Angerona, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of silence. For better it were for them to be dumbe
images of a vaine Goddesse, then the clattering false spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of sathan.</p>
   <p>The hurt that may come vnto thee (Christian Reader)
by the poison of these vipers, if it do but touch thee, for
<hi>Sub melle latet venenum,</hi> vnder the greene grasse lieth a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and falsehood is couloured with truth, hath made
me carefull for thy good, to publish this small treatise.
Therefore such as it is, take it well in worth, and forget
not this caueat of our sauiour Christ, saying: <hi>Take heede
what ye heare.</hi>
