   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR <hi>IOHN LEVENTHORP,</hi> KNIGHT, and to the most wise and vertuous Lady IOANE his wife, Grace and Peace from God the Father, and <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ, bee multiplied.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY causes there were (<hi>Right Worshipfull</hi>) that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee to penne this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but especially these following.</p>
   <p>The first cause was, the hindering at least of Satans busie working, euen in our reformed Church, who as in the times of darknesse hee murthered mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of soules through Idolatrous Deuotions, and the false imagination of
<pb facs="3"/> meritorious workes: euen so doth hee now in the cleere light of the Gospell, slay a great number through a liuelesse faith, and outward empty profession: Yet in both times hath there been a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number, whose workes were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and whose faith is fruitfull: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end that they who through selfe-loue, and ignorance of Gods lawes seeme to bee somewhat, may see what sinnes they daily commit, and what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they continually omit, that they (I say) who seeme to themselues beautifull and rich enough, may see themselues to bee but wretched, miserable, poore, blind, and naked, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 17. For their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite and good, I first attempted this short Treatise.</p>
   <p>A second reason was, because I saw very many, yet so ignorant, as that they thinke they can keepe the whole Law, grossely, and Pharisaically, examining themselues by the outward letter of the tenne Words, or Commandements, euen which notwithstanding they make small conscience continually to breake,
<pb facs="3"/> because God is mercifull: so that with them, as with carnall Gospellers, the commandements are quite growne out of request.</p>
   <p>A third reason like to this was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that many euen on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, doe comfort themselues onely in their owne righteousnesse, which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this, that they haue alwaies paid euery man his owne; That they neuer hurt their neighbour by word or deed; That they haue euer carryed a good meaning whatsoeuer they said, or did; That they haue giuen almes to the poore, whereupon some, being exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Minister to repent, and to call vpon God for mercy in Iesus Christ, haue answered, that they knew no sinne they had. Others againe, being more then wontedly sick, haue maruelled that God should so vndeseruedly punish them.</p>
   <p>A fourth reason was, because that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not willing to buy a larger Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, partly for the cost, partly for the length thereof (as they thinke, who are
<pb facs="4"/> cumbred with <hi>Martha</hi> about many things) might bee induced, and allured to buy, and reade this short Exposition, both for the little price, for the plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and for the many proofes, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie thereof.</p>
   <p>A fifth reason was, that children and yong folkes, hauing learned by heart the Principles of Christian Religion, might be instructed further in the Law, which is the end of vertuous and godly life, both that they may vnderstand Sermons the better, when they heare that whereof they haue already a fundamentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (which must needes stirre vp in them, a desire to heare and know further therein, whereof commeth dilligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) and also, that knowing when they do well, and when they do ill, not onely in deed, but in word and thought, they may bee brought to make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of euery sinne, which the ignorant cannot do; that their mindes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences being possessed with the lawes of God in euery particular, in their yong age, the head of sinne may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<pb facs="4"/> and kept vnder; that they may truely repent of their sinnes, which they that know not sinne, cannot do; and that they may know to what commandement euery vertue and sinne is referred.</p>
   <p>And lastly, the reasons why I was bold to offer so small a present to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, of whom I haue receiued so many kindnesses, and am indeed for sundry respects for euer obliged vnto you, are. First because I haue alwaies knowne you to be a sincere louer of learning, simply for it selfe without by-respects, which plainely appeareth in this; that you haue not onely beene alwaies a speciall fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Patron of the learned, but also separating your selfe from the world, as much as your place and calling will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, haue euer deuoted your selfe to all good learning. Moreouer the inward and sincere loue and affection in the Lord, that I haue alwaies heeretofore, at this present, and euer shall beare vnto you, and your good Lady, for these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and most amiable vertues, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, truth, vprightnesse, kindnesse,
<pb facs="5"/> compassion tender-heartednesse, haue enforced mee to shew forth my hid and smothered loue, wherein I am able, and wherein it could finde passage: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I desire your Worships both in one, whom coniugall and Christian loue, and vnanimity, haue made one, to accept this little gift, which I am bold to cast into the treasury of Gods Church, vnder your Worships protection.</p>
   <p>The Lord continue still his fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindnesse, goodnesse, and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, in powring downe still his manifold blessings vpon your ancient and honoured Family, from generation to generation for euer:</p>
