      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue here set for the (moost deare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) a rude worke, whome it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me to call the manuall of prayers, because it is so commenly had in hande wyth the people, whyche before was called the prymer, because (I suppose) that it is the fyrste boke that the tender youth was instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in. And in thys prymer were conteyned a greate nomber of vnnecessary prayers, and some very superstycyous, but in especyall therein was the chefe suffrages, that is to saye, the matens wyth the houres, euensonge wyth complene, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be of oure Lady. For thys cause so called (as some vnlearned hathe bothe fayned and taughte) that she shulde vse to saye it, but howe false and folyshe thys is, let the learned iudge, but rather it was so called, because that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes, hymnes, lessons, responces, chapters, and collectes, were thoughte to be of oure Lady, yet were there many scriptures dystorted vnto oure Lady, whyche in theyr owne natyue sence are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge mente of her, but of Chryst, the wysedome of the father. As for an example at the fyrste howe the Chapter is, <hi>in omnibus requiem quesiui,</hi> wrytten Ecclesiastici. xxiiii. wyth the chapters of the houres and of complene. For thys cause haue I thoughte it my bonde deute towardes Goddes true and syncere honoure to sette forthe suche a maner of prymer, wherein myghte be no suche di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted scrypture or false honoure of that mooste
<pb facs="10"/>
immaculate mother of God, least the youth shuld learnd to take such scriptures to be of our Lady, whyche are of God, and to geue such prayse to her as shulde onely be geuen to God, but to knowe fyrste the true honoure of God, and to knowe the honoure that belongeth to that blessed vyrgyne Mary and to the holy sayntes. And for as much as the prymer is not had in hande of so many, but all they, ye euery Christiā is boūde fyrst to learne to lede a christian lyfe, therfore haue I here in the proces of thys prymer in maner poynted and set forthe the true lyfe of a Christian, that as ofte as he shall handell hys prymer, he maye so oftē learne and remember the true lyfe towarde God, whych lyfe consysteth princypally and wholy, in fayth, in prayer, and in good workes, and these thre are not only taught in the thre lessons of Matens, but al so in the thre partes of thys prymer so diuided. For in the fyrste parte thou arte taught thynges of faythe, where in thou haste the Symbole or Crede of Athanase, the .xij. articles or Crede, a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of eche of the foure euangelistes, puttynge the in remembraunce of the faythe that thou arte bounde to haue to the gospels &amp; word of God. In the seconde parte thou haste thynges concernyng prayer. Fyrste the beades, the pater noster, and the salutacyon, a prayer to be sayde in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, grace afore dyner, grace after dyner, grace before supper, grace after supper, a prayer whan thou goeste to bedde, a prologe to the Matens,
<pb facs="11"/>
wyth the, houres, than the Matens and houres, a prologe to euensonge, Euensonge, a prologe to Complene, Complene, Salue rex misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, O bone Iesu, Conditor celi, the .xv. Does, wyth theyre prologe, the seuen Psalmes wyth the prologe, the Letany wyth the prologe, a treatyse of the sacrament of the aulter wyth thre prayers, the Dirige wyth his prologe. In the thyrde parte thou haste thynges conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nynge workes, as the commaundementes set forthe at large wyth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claracyon of the kyndes of workes, these haue I set out, both in Englysshe and Laten for the more parte to thende that the deuoute (for hys choyse) maye reade whether he wyll. But where there shall seme to the reader in the Psalmes ony dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the Laten and Englysshe, let the same remember that the Englyshe is accordaunte to the Hebraicall Psalter translated by saynt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, and the laten is the vsuall Psalter, whyche in some places are not correspondent in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thus haue I ioyned them, that such as de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyteth in the Englysshe, myghte haue the playner sentence, and that the other that readeth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shulde not thynke that we shulde brynge in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strannge psalmony.</p>
   <p>Moreouer where as the Psalmes and anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, hymnes, lessons, whyche were ryghte good, are nowe chaunged, thys dyd I, not that I shulde thynke them worthy of reieccyon, other that I wolde be noted to be of suche rare and excellente
<pb facs="11"/>
iudgemente, that I wolde correcte the vse of the church so longe continued, but rather thys haue I enterprysed, because that in the sayde anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, hymnes, and lessons are suche sentences, and in the sayde psalmes is suche abscuryte and darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, that the rude and the vnlearned (which hath mooste the vse of suche kynde of bokes as thys is) myghte not comprehende the misteryes of them, and here by had the lesse deuotion, hauynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe psalmes, anthemes, lessons and hymnes of more playne sentēce, they maye better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the same, and in vnderstandynge shall haue more contemplacion and deuocion.</p>
   <p>To auoyde prolixite (whyche often tyme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth deuocion) the greate nomber of memoryes of the sayntes vsed in the Matens, of the whyche some doth playnly derogate the honoure of god, is omytted.</p>
   <p>I omytted also the greate nomber of sayntes commenly set forth in other prymers in the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not because that I wolde go aboute to teache here in, the people that they shulde not praye to sayntes, other that I do mystrust the holynes of the sayntes, that are here omytted, but that they (accordynge to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kynges graces iniunction) shuld haue the greater deuocion in the suffrages that followeth in the letany then in nombrynge so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sayntes.</p>
   <p>In the Dirige set forthe in other prymers, were made anthemes, responses, and lessons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb facs="12"/>
for the deade whyche semed more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentacions of the myserye of mans lyfe then the prayers for the deade. I thoughte it conueniente to chaunge the same, &amp; to declare by the thre fyrste lessons, and responses, the myserable state of mās lyfe, by the seconde, the condicion of the sepulture and by the thre last lessons, to declare the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generall that the deuoute reader encombred wyth the mysery of thys presente lyfe, by faythe and hope of the laste resurreccyon myghte wyth the more paciens tollerate this iourney abydyng Christ the iudge of quycke and deade, whyche ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and reygneth euerlastynge. So be it.</p>
