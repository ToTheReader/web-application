   <l>IF painfull pilgryme for his toyle, deserues a guerdon due</l>
   <l>In seeking of the sacred sorte, which vertue doth pursue:</l>
   <l>Or if the wakeful watche in warre, do merit like reward,</l>
   <l>Or cunning pylot that with skill, doth take his due regard,</l>
   <l>To cut in twayne the billowes huge, that swell in Occean sea,</l>
   <l>And keepes the keele aright his course, tyll wished port he wray:</l>
   <l>Then (Ritche) that rings this larum bell, to warne his countreyes thrall,</l>
   <l>And sortes (much like the busie bee) the hunny from the gall,</l>
   <l>Deserues no lesse, in lieu thereof: such fruite I reape thereby,</l>
   <l>As for my parte, a double prayse, I may him not deny.</l>
   <l>The toyle to him no profit yeelds, he bites on bitter paine:</l>
   <l>He hales home haruest for the chaffe, the reader reapes the graine.</l>
   <l>He giues the sworde and shield in hande, to shroud thee from annoy,</l>
   <l>He wisely warnes thee of the worse, lest foes might thee destroy:</l>
   <l>He treades thee out a perfect path, oh England loude I crye,</l>
   <l>Refuse therefore thy follies past, he sees thee goe awrye:</l>
   <l>And leaue of al thy lustfull lyfe, and eke thy great excesse,</l>
   <l>Thy dainty fare, thy fine array, and eke thy wantonnesse.</l>
   <l>Leaue of likewise thy vsance great, and leaue thy lawing vaine,</l>
   <l>Lest for the present guyle thereof, there happe some future paine.</l>
   <l>Yet God forbid but iustice should in eche thing beare the sway,</l>
   <l>And lawe is good where lawe is vsde, I cannot this denay.</l>
   <l>But so your Common lawes are courst, at will of euery pelth,</l>
   <l>That common is the woe (God knowes) but priuate is the wealth.</l>
   <l>Do sorte thy selfe from Comedies, and foolish playes of loue,</l>
   <l>Lest tragicall and worse perhaps in fine thee chaunce to proue.</l>
   <l>Take sword in hand, and leaue of ease, for nowe the tyme is comme,</l>
   <l>The bell is rong, the trumpettes sound, all arme doth strike the dromme.</l>
   <l>And thanke good (Ritch) that rings the same, to wake thee out of sleepe,</l>
   <l>That thou thy selfe, that liuest at peace, in safetie still mightst keepe.</l>
   <l>A iewel ritche and gemme of price, the same no doubt doth seeme,</l>
   <l>A ritcher gifte for thy behoofe, he could not geue, I deeme.</l>
