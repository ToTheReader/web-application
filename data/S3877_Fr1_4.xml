   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He whole sum and effect of all diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
philosophie, wherein all kinde of excellent and exquisite knowledge
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, tendeth chiefly vnto this scope, and may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
brieflie in these two cardinall and principall precepts, namely: <hi>To know
God,</hi> and, <hi>To know a mans selfe.</hi> For these two exceeding great
and large bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of wisedome, reaching by faith (but not by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie)
euen to the throne of the Maiestie of God aboue al heauens,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> and spreading and stretching forth
themselues ouer all the workes of God in nature, are not only verie
necessarie vnto vertuous life, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersation, but also verie
expedient &amp; behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto euerlasting life and saluation. These be
the two readie steps, by which we must ascend vp vnto the onely perfect
and true doore of eternall life, euen Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Authour, Captaine,
and finisher of our faith: by whom whosoeuer entreth, he shall be
saued, and shall go in and our, and finde pasture, that is,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> shall enioy the gift of grace, the treasure of
truth, the food of immortalitie. <hi>The knowledge of God</hi> is acquired by
two maner of studies or meditatiōs. First by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and
consideration of his glorious, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and wonderfull workes: for the
inuisible things of him, that is to say, his eternal power and
Godhead,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> are seene by the creation of the
worlde, being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his workes. Secondly, God is knowen by his word,
and he will be found of them which seeke him therein diligently and
desirously.<note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> For so sayth the
wisedome of God by <hi>Salomon,</hi> I loue them that loue me: and they that
seeke me early, shall find me. Vnto <pb facs="6"/> thē therefore which
studiously meditate in the holy Scriptures, and attentiuely heare the
Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, God doth reueale and make knowne the richer of his glorious
mysteries, which riches is Christ m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> the hope of glorie. For by the
sincere preaching of him euery man is admonished,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1.</note> &amp; euery man is taught in all wisdome,
that euery man may be presented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Christ Iesus. The knowledge
of a mans selfe is attained likewise by two intentiue cogitations, and
diligent considerations, which do both proceed from the most pure fountaine
of the infallible worde of God. The one is, if a man ponder and consider well
the excellencie of his creation.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. Coloss. 3. 1
Cor. 11. Iam. 1.</note> The other is, if a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> beholde himselfe in the worde
of God, and looke i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the perfect lawe of libertie, and continue therein. For
Gods worde is a glasse, wherein we must behold our selues, and become
like vnto him. And therin he shall see,<note place="margin">Eccles.
17.</note> that as the wise man sayth, God hath created man of the earth,
and turned him vnto it againe. He hath giuen him the number of daies and
certaine times, and power of the thinges that are vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arth. He clothed thē
with strength as they had need, and made them according to his image. Hee
filled them with knowledge of vnderstanding, and shewed them good and euill
He set his eie vpon their hearts, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them his noble workes. And
gaue them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to reioice perpetually in his miracles, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> they
should prudently declare his workes, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the elect should praise his
holie name together. The Philosophers hauing some taste and feeling of
this knowledge, euen by the lawe and instinct of nature (although they were
destitute of the law of the holy spirite and of grace, that commeth by the
faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ) called this studious meditation a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue
life, or speculatiue science: wherin whosoeuer doth employ his trauaile
and diligence industriously and giue his heart to search and finde out
wisedom by all things that are done vnder the heauen,<note place="margin">Eccl.
1.</note> that is <pb facs="6"/> to say, of all the workes of God in the
wonderfull workmanship and creation of the world, so far forth and so
much as the lord God the giuer of wisedome and of all good giftes, doth
distribute and deuide to euerie man, in such maner as it pleaseth him,
&amp; such measure as he knoweth euery man hath neede of: he shall
surely find, and vndoubtedly proue, yea euen by experience, that in this life
ther is no felicitie,<note place="margin">Genes. 47. Hebr. 11. 1. Ioh. 5. Iob.
14. Galat. 5. Eccles. 2.</note> that this world is nothing els but a
perillous pilgrimage, a maze of miserie, a surging sea of sorowes and
trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, a continual conflict, a wretched warfare, a gulfe of greefes, a huge
heape of iniquities, and a wast wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes full of vanities and vexation of
the spirite, &amp; that there is no profite vnder the sun. For thus hath it
pleased the lord the Creatour and conseruatour of all things by his
excellent wisedome,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> to humble the heart
of man in this sore trauaile, that he hath giuen to the sonnes of men,
&amp; in the consideration of mans fraile state and miserable condition:
and to eleuate, extoll, and lift vp his mind in looking and aspiring vnto
heauēly things, to the end that he should,<note place="margin">Cic. 4. Acad
quest. &amp; in Somn. Scip.</note> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> saieth, with an
high, noble, and inuincible heart, contemne these humaine, visible,
corruptible, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mortal, caducal, traunsitory &amp; momentanythings:
&amp; as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostle saieth,<note place="margin">Philipp. 3.</note> follow
hard toward the marke for the prise of the high calling of God in Christ
Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: sighing &amp; desiring to be cloathed with our house which is
from heauen:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> And seeke those things
which are aboue, &amp; set our affections on heauenly things,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3.</note> &amp; not one things which are on the earth:
and direct &amp; erect al our cares, studies, cogitations, desires and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights vnto Christ Iesus, which sitteth at the right hand of God: that
our conuersation may be in heauē with him. And for him that true,
incorruptible and vnspeakable treasure to iudge all these things to bee
but dung:<note place="margin">Philipp. 3.</note> And for the winning of him to
thinke and count al these things but losse, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we may be found in
<pb facs="7"/> him that is, not hauing our owne righteousnes which is of the
lawe, but that which is through the faith of Christ, euen the righteousnes
whiche is of God through faith:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> And that
wee should not looke on the things which are seene, but on the thinges
which are not seene:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> And that like the
foules of the heauen, and the lilies of the field, which liue and growe without
care and toile of this life, wee should not weary our selues in labouring
for the meate which perisheth, but labour for the meat which endureth vnto
euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> which the sonne of man
shall giue vnto vs. For as the Israelites walked, iourneyed, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the great wildernes fourtie yeares,<note place="margin">Psal. 66, &amp;
107.</note> and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through manie probations &amp; tribulations, before
they did goe in and possesse that good land that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with milke and
honie, which the lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and sworne vnto their fathers to giue
them Euen so the same our good God, which so conducted his peculier
people, and proued them with many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series &amp; afflictions, before he
brought them to that plentifull land, doth in like maner by his fatherly
prouidence and fauourable protection, leade vs his adopted children,<note place="margin">Galat.
4. Ephes. 1.</note> whom he hath receiued by grace, through the great wide
wildernesse of this wicked &amp; wretched world: In which our iourney
towardes that happie and heauenly countrey, that continuing citie to come,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. &amp; 12.</note> he trieth vs with manie kind of troubles
and calamities,<note place="margin">Psal. 66. &amp; 78. Ioh. 14.</note> and
causeth vs, as the Psalmist saieth, to go through fire &amp; water,
before he bring vs forth to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> welthie place, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> pleasaunt land, that
celestiall habitation, those eternall mansions, that supernall
Ierusalem the mother of vs all,<note place="margin">Galat. 4. Coloss. 1.
Act. 14.</note> the euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his deare sonne Iesus
Christ, vnto which we must enter through many tribulations. This is that
precept which our Sauiour doth inculcate into the eares and hearts of all them
which will folow him, and become his true disciples,<note place="margin">Luc.
9.</note> namely to forsake and <pb facs="7"/> denie themselues, &amp; take
their crosse paciently, that is to say, to suffer constantly all
tribulations that the lord laieth vpon them:<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 1.
Cor. 9.</note> And to cast awaie euery thing that presseth downe, as
riches, cares, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes: And so abstaine, that they may get the
mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie: and finally so runne, that in Christ Iesus they may obtaine
victoriously, and be crowned with him triumphantlie. Vnto this continuall
bickering and warfare, wherein the church of Christ militant here on earth is
continually exercised, he himselfe being our most mightie and
puissant Capitaine, doth ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage vs most comfortably with
these wordes,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note>
      <hi>Be of good comfort</hi>
(saieth he) <hi>I haue overcome the world.</hi> For he hath conquered the
Deuil, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world sin, damnation, death, and hell for vs, and hath loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all our sorowes. Therefore this holy, heauenly, &amp; diuine contemplation
raiseth &amp; lifteth vp our harts, our cogitations, our studies, our
sences, desires, and loue from vaine pleasures vnto the true and
euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting treasures, according to that effectual and pithy praier of
Dauid: <hi>O turne awaie mine eyes, least they behold vanitie.</hi> For
indeede all things are vaine,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. Wis. 13.</note>
except the knowledge of God, and most miserable are they that are
destitute thereof. Now as concerning the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans
selfe,</hi> wherewith euery Christian ought to be instructed &amp;
endued: there is almost no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, mortall and earthly man no not commonly
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathē, much lesse among true Christians, but that by the
vse of reason and quicknes of wit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by nature, he vnderstandeth
and perceiueth himselfe to be created and ordeined of God to a far better,
happier, and more excellent end &amp; purpose, then all other creatures voide
of reason, wit, &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ouer whiche creatures God the creator hath
made and constituted man lord, ruler &amp; gouernour:<note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> And in the creation of him, which, as Dauid
saith, is wonderfull and fearefull, he hath made the fashion,<note place="margin">Psal. 139.</note>
      <pb facs="8"/> forme, &amp; shape of his body
straight vpright towards heauen: wherby he is admonished to lift vp his
heart vnto heauen, &amp; set his loue on heauenly things: and not to fix and
cast down his cogitations vpon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things only: but to haue mind
continually on that diuine,<note place="margin">Genes. 1.</note> spirituall,
and immortall substaunce, whereof his soule is a likenes and image: And
to cōsider, that in this his meruailous creation, hee excelleth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liuing creatures, whose bodily shape is in forme prone and groueling downe
towardes the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created and ordained vnto corruption,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto vanitie, and destinated to
perish with the earth: whereas contrariwise, man is appointed and
assigned thorowe faith in Christ Iesus vnto immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie and eternall
felicitie in heauen. This certaine persuasion and true opinion the poet
vndoubtedly seemed to haue fixed and stablished in his mind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the same in these elegant verses.

         <l>Commanded him he should.</l>
      </q> But whosoeuer will knowe
him selfe rightly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, must cōsider, that mā consisteth
of two parts, namely the bodie and kthe soule: whereof the one is subiect
to corruption, the other is incoruptible, the one perceiued sensible,
thother inuisible, the one subiect to death, the other immortall, the one a
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, spirituall and heauenly substaunce, the other a grosse and
fraile lumpe of earth, which turneth into earth againe. In euery faithfull,
vertuous, and godly Christian the soule (which is the highest or chiefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="8"/> part of the mind or spirite or power intellectiue) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by
the Spirite of God, ought to rule the body and the lustes, appetites and
desires therof: And the bodie as a seruaunt or minister vnto his lord
&amp; mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, ought alwaies to be obedient to the good and godly motions of
the Spirite, as the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, saying If ye mortifie the deeds of
the body by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Spirite ye shall liue. And a little after he saieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The same Spirite beareth witnes w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our
spirite, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wee are the children of God. So that wee haue two witnesses,
that is to say, Gods spirite, and ours, which is certified by the Spirite
of God: which must haue domination ouer the affections, lustes,
perturbations, will, desires, &amp; cōcupiscence. For if at any time the
bodie beeing not thus kept in subiection, do happen to rebell and make
insurection against the Spirite, and like an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed colte which casteth
of his rider, do throwe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the yoke of obedience, and make war against
y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> honest, good, godly, &amp; vertuous desires of the mind, surely then
the whole man bothe bodie and soule must needs run, euen as though he were
caried hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, into all kind of vices, wickednes, and sin, and so
consequently bee throwne downe into the guife or pit of eternall damnation
and destruction. Of this most perillous and pernicious fall the Apostle
giueth vs a very good and profitable admonitiō, saying, Let not sin reigne
in your mortall bodie, that yee should obey it in the lusts thereof. For
the bodie,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to sin,
presseth downe the soule that museth of many things, and cloggeth,
darkneth, &amp; dulleth the vnderstanding, so that it cannot lift vp it
selfe in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations and heauenly contemplations. Vnto this place that
precept of <hi>Cicero</hi> seemeth not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnfit to be referred, when
he saieth, <hi>Rationi appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus pareat.</hi> Let the appetite be ruled by
reason.<note place="margin">Cic. 1 lib. Offic. Cic. ibidē.</note> And againe
he saieth, <hi>Naturam optimam viuendi ducem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamur.</hi> Let vs follow
nature the best guide of life. In <pb facs="9"/> these two briefe documents
the whole summe and scope of all morall philosophie, in my iudgement, may
well be comprehended. For when the gentiles, which haue not the lawe, doe by
nature the things conteined in the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> they
hauing not the lawe, are a lawe vnto themselues, which shewe the effect of
the lawe written in their heartes. I feare lest this may iustlie be
spoken to our great shame in these daies, which being professed
Christians, and peyfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the lawe of God, and many of vs
very skilfull not onely in humane, but also in heauenly, sacred, and
diuine philosophie, are so led with selfe-loue, and so caried awaie
from God with worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and momentanie delights:<note place="margin">Mat.
10.</note> and seeke so much to saue our liues, as our Sauiour saieth,
that wee lose our liues▪ for we prefer our liues before the glorie of
Christ: And knowing our maisters will, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our
selues,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> neither doing according to his wil
wee shall be beaten with many stripes: I feare, I saie, lest the
heathen or gentiles, which in the time of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without lawe, liued
vertuously, shall condemne vs, whiche in the time of grace, hauing the lawe
of God do liue vitiously.</p>
   <p>To the end therefore to awake vs from our sleepy senceles, and
sinfull securitie, where with many of vs are heauilie oppressed and
deeply drowned: I haue thought good by bringing this little booke abroad vnto
the commune commoditie, I trust of all then that reade the same, to stir
vp the mindes of such as are drowned in voluptuousnes, and cast downe
into the deepthe of the earth with cares of this life, and to raise them vp
vnto the consideration of their sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e and vocation, wherein God hath placed

wee warily, watchfully, and circumspectly, withstand and resist the
assaults, inuasions, and irruptions of our malicious and pestiferous
aduersaries, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually by all meanes possible, do seeke,
deuise, and worke our ouerthrow and vtter destruction. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this
booke being a very learned man, as it appeareth by his writing, was no doubt
greatly infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the godly zeale of Christianitie and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, of
true religion and integritie of life: because herein he hath left vnto vs
such a worthy worke? Wherein is contained the way and meanes, how wee may and
must acquire and obtaine the assuraunce of our soules health and
saluation, which is a thing most necessarie for all men to know. And
this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hath the author comprehend ed in a fewe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters so breifly
and compendiously, that the reader may gather and receiue as sufficient
instruction and vtilitie by meditating in the same, as in perusing the
whole Bible, and all the expositions and paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall explications of
the holy Scriptures, written by the auncient and learned fathers.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.6</note> For like as our Sauiour reduced the whole summe
of all the lawe &amp; the prophets into a sweete short sermon,<note place="margin">Mat.
22.</note> yea into two short commaundements of perfect loue towards God and
towardes our neighbour,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and therein hath knit
vp the knot of all righteousnes, &amp; tied the bond of perfection: Euen so
this author hath obserued the same order, and vsed the like methode in
this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious forme of exhortation. Moreouer he being a very expert and
skilfull phisicion, hath also prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto the studious reader an
excellent briefe die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie for the conseruation of the health of the bodie:
which whosoeuer will deligentlie keepe and folowe, he shall, I dare be bold
to say, haue as many good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts necessarie and profitable inough for
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing <pb facs="10"/> of bodilie health, as in reading all the great
volumes of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Auicenna, Rhazis,</hi> and whatsoeuer
others, that haue learnedly and largely written of Phisicke.</p>
   <p>And lastly of morall philosophie, or doctrine of maners, and
politique regiment of life, he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so pithilie and witrily, that
these fewe leaues do afford as much good &amp; wise instruction
concerning vertuous and honest conuersation, modestie, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
sobrietie, and prudent gouernaunce of all mens publike and priuate actions,
as <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> and all other Philosophers and humane
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (the reading of whose workes were a tedious &amp; infinite labour)
do conteine. In this booke therefore the reader shall reape a triple or
threefold commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: namely, the health of bodie, the saluation of soule,
and the integritie of life, as an inseparable companion of them both. This
booke is an <hi>Epitome,</hi> that is to say, a short summarie or
compendious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of diuine, humane, naturall, and morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie:
So that in the litle labour of reading the same studiously, and
meditating and ruminating the preceptes thereof diligently, the reader shalbe
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and profited exceedingly. And bicause ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the corruption
of our depraued nature wee are more prone, more inclined, more diligent and
carefull to seeke the health of our bodies, then the salfetie and
saluation of our soules, &amp; take more thought, and make greater
prouision for the flesh to fulfill the lustes of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2.</note> then to desire and acquire the
sincere milke of the word of God, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with meekenesse,
is able to saue our soule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> Therefore of these two things, namely, health
of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and saluation of soule, which are both indeede worthie to be
desired (but yet the one much more then the other) that which is a great
deale more worthie to be sought &amp; laboured for, is in this books
<pb facs="10"/> verie orderly and aptly first set downe, according to that
diuine and principall precept of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note>
Seeke yee first the kingdom of God &amp; his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Whereby
we are admonished, that as the soule, being as I said before, a diuine,
spirituall, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall substaunce, doth farre excell the bodie, which
is nothing els but dust, earth and ashes:<note place="margin">Genes.
18.</note> Euen so the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and eternall foode and assured
saluation of the soule ought to be acquired with far greater care and more
earnest studie, zeale, loue, desire and affection, then the health and
welfare of the bodie. But alas, how lamentable a thing is it in these dayes,
wherein the light of the Gospell shineth so clearely, to see the
preposterous peruersitie of many of vs, whose minds like vnto brute
beastes, are fixed vpon present and caducall things, and are plucked and
cast downe frō heauen and heauenly desires vnto earth and earthly
vanities, and do care and trauaile incessantly for the pampering and
cherishing of the bodie, but are so slouthful, careles and negligent in
seeking the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our soules.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note>
And albeit I confesse with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, that no man knoweth the thinges
of a man, saue the spirite of a man which is in him: Neither doth any man
knowe and vnderstand the heartes of men, but God onely:<note place="margin">Psal. 33. Mat. 12.</note> yet bycause a good man out of the
good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good thinges▪ and an euill man
out of an euill treasure bringeth forth euill thinges: for of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaketh: Therefore by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, may the
inward mā be perceiued of them which intentiuely looke thereupon, &amp;
examine the conuersation of men by the lawe of God, and trie the spirites,
whether they be of God,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.</note> by the
touchstone of truthe. And againe, although wee ought not to iudge any thing
of our brethren before the time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord come,<note place="margin">1.
Cor. 4.</note> who will lighten things that are hid in darkenes, and make the
counsels of the hearts <pb facs="11"/> manifest: lest wee our selues by
iudging be iudged, and in condemning be condemned:<note place="margin">Luke.
6.</note> Yet if wee looke not euery man on his owne thinges, but euery man
also on the things of other men:<note place="margin">Philipp. 2.</note> and
behold some mens sinnes that are open before hand, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto
iudgement:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> and take heed both vnto our
selues, and to all the flocke, whereof the holy Ghost hath made vs
ouerseers,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> to feede the Church of God,
which he hath purchased with his owne bloud: (I speake to them that are
called thereunto) wee may easily and euidently see,<note place="margin">1.
Iohn. 5.</note> if wee will not winke one at anothers faults, that the whole
world lyeth in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, that is, all men generally, as of themselues, lye
as it were buried in euill, and that many wicked people forget God,<note place="margin">Psal. 9.</note> and therefore, as the prophet sayeth, shall
be turned into hell. For of two detestable iniquities &amp; most grieuous
enormities, namely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnes, and forgetfulnes of God, we haue in these
our dayes two manifest arguments, apparent signes, and plaine tokens, to
wit, mens negligence, coldnes and slackenesse in the inuocation of God by
praier, and their ingratitude in not ascribing praise and giuing thanks to
the Lord of life for his benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpō vs. These two kinds of
impietie do spring from two most horrible and filthie fountaines of all
iniquitie, namelie ignorance, and securitie: Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when a man knoweth

the dayes are euill: and recompence the race of lewde life that we haue runne,
with godly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the residue of our age. And forasmuch as wee
commonly consume and lose the most and best part of our age and life
time, especially youth in vanities and friuolous delights: wee must
beware,<note place="margin">Luke. 21.</note> least our hearts be oppressed
and ouercome with cares, with sensualitie, with intemperance, with
concupiscence, and voluptuousnes, and so death come hastily vpon vs,
and preuent vs,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12</note> before we remember our
creator now in the dayes of our youth, wealth and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5.</note> and least the day of the Lord comming as
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly and suddenly as a theefe in the night, take vs vnwares, and
finde vs vnprepared and prouided. But let vs watch diligently and continually
for the defence and safegard of our houses, that is to say, of these
our earthly and transitorie tabernacles,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note>
our fraile bodies, and let vs not suffer them to be broken vp and digged
through, and the treasures of our soules dearely bought,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> and our consciences purged with the bloud of
Iesus Christ, to be spoyled and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away vnto perdition by the
vncleane spirite, which neuer resteth vntill he returne vnto the place from
whence he came out,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> if he can find
ingresse and regresse possibly, and maketh the end of his captiue
farre worse, and more miserable then the beginning. And let vs through
assured faith in Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> lay vp
for our soules incorruptible and vnmoueable treasures in heauen: and
whilest we are in these ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, let vs keepe surely and safely
the same treasures of the grace of Christ Iesus in these our earthen
vessels.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> Happie are they that haue
their loynes girded about, and waite for their master, with their lights or
lamps burning in their hāds:<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> the light
whereof shineth to the glorie and praise of God, and to the good example of
men, and edification of the Church of Christ, whose godly, vertuous, and
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <pb facs="15"/> conuersation euen the Gentile, superstitious,
&amp; idolatrous people beholding,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> are
moued and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby to extoll and magnifie the name of god, in the day
when God dooth mollifie, open, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate their blind and hard harts, by
the light of the Gospel of Iesus Christ. If we would consider howe
short, momentanie &amp; miserable our life is, we should neuer bee drawne
with any earthly pleasures, and worldly delights (which indeed are nothing
else but miseries) from the most comfortable contemplation, cogitation,
and desire of that life to come, which so farre excedeth this, as no heart
is able to conceiue, nor tongue expresse. For, as the Apostle sayeth,
The thinges which eie hath not seene, neither eare hath heard,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> neyther came into mans hart, are, which God hath
prepared for them that loue him.<note place="margin">Esai. 64.</note> So that
no mortall man can thinke Gods prouidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his. The eternitie of which
incomprehensible and inexplicable felicitie may be perceyued by these
wordes,<note place="margin">Eccles. 18.</note> lyke as drops of rayne are vnto
the sea, and as a grauell stone is vnto the sand, euen so is a
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares vnto the daies euerlasting. But as for our life what is it
els but a vapour,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.</note> that appeareth for a little
tyme, and then vanisheth awaie? Dauid very aptly likeneth and resembleth
the life of man som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme to a spanne,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. Psal.
90.</note> somtime to a shadowe, somtime to sleepe, sometime to a
wind that passeth ouer, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not agayne, sometime to a dreame,
somtime to a tale that is told,<note place="margin">Psal. 49 62 102 &amp; 103
73. &amp; 78.</note> the remembrance whereof is soone and suddainly gone,
sometime to vanitie, sometime to a flower, to hay, to grasse, to
beasts that perish. And therefore he oftentimes complaineth of the
short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his age and life time. Full well in deed may our life be
likened to a dreame, the delights &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures therof do so soone
vanish away, euen as cōmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cōmeth to passe in a dreame when one
awaketh. For a man dreameth, that he hath great plētie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb facs="15"/> meates and banketting cheare, &amp; when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh, he feeleth
nothing but hunger. Againe, in sleepe a man weeneth, that he hath abundance
of riches, golde and siluer, and worldly wealth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaked, findeth
nothing but pouertie. Euen so all the glorie, beautie, brauerie, pompe, pride
and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this world, passeth and vanisheth away like a dreame
or a traunce, like a phantasie or most vaine vision. Therefore the earth
is as it were a stage, whereon euery man liuing in his state, condition,
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and degree, doth play his part: Some represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and beareth one
person, some another. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, kings, princes, presidents,
lieutenants, bishops, Iudges, magistrates, philosophers, learned men, and
all they which being placed in any degree of dignity, do rule &amp; gouern y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
common wealth,<note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> are not in deed those
persons, which in the eie of the world, and light of the common wealth they
shew themselues to bee, neither are they in very deed indued with such
good things as they seeme to haue. No surely, they are but plaiers vpon the
scaffold for a short time: yea accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this cōmon saying, <hi>Homo
bulla,</hi> they walke in a vaine shadow. And therefore their felicitie,<note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> be it neuer so glorious in the eies of
men,<note place="margin">Eccle. 1.</note> is nothing else but vanitie. For the
riches of this world is euen beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie: and the wisedome of men what is it
else but foolishnesse?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> They that
take paine and haue pleasure and delectation in reading, not onely the

the strange mutations, alterations, subuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ruines of the

common wealths, and of the suddaine decay and passing away of the pompe

vnto their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, may well consider and easily see, how fraile,
