Saint, lately wife to the one,

long after at the request of some of you for your owne

is a necessitie of knowledge, faith, feare of God, and

of attaining them, and some good measure of
them, vnto either. Examples of the weaker Sex appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

for that, as they shame men, if they come short of
such, so they giue women incouragement to contend,
and good hope to attaine vnto, what they see others of
their Sex haue before them by like contending attained.
But domesticall examples are of all other the most
powerfull. And therefore whatsoeuer effect this shall
haue with others, it ought in speciall manner to preuaile
with you, who had so speciall interest in her, whose
memorie is so sacred with all those that here knew her,
and who were continuall eye-witnesses of those her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
parts and godly courses, which most others had in
part onely by heare-say. And doubtles that is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
honour we can doe to our religious Auncestors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
if we endeuour so to resemble them in good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>s
and godlinesse, that by our religious courses and cariage
we may be knowne to haue come of them, and they may
seeme to surviue in vs. The manner of her end, so
sweet, so cheerefull, so comfortable, should the rather
encite you hereunto, that, if you desire to finde that
comfort then that she did, and to giue that comfort to
<pb facs="4"/>
others, that you had then in her, you take that course
that you saw shee did, lay a sure foundation in life
for comfort in death, and be continually building vpon
it when it is once surely laid. Now that this weake
worke may a litle at least further you therein, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to grant, whose power appeares in our weaknesse,
and who by weake meanes is able to effect weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
To his blessing, I commend both you and it, and
so rest</p>
