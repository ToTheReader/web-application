   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE the visible succession of lawfull Pastours, and the perpetuall pedegree of zealous belieuers is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible marke of Christs chosen Church, I haue heere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to thy view: First the supreme Heads and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Roman Church. 2. The chiefe professours, yea of our own Nation of Scotland, by which it hath been taught &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. 3. I shew the pedegree of the Kings of Scotland, all Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, from Donald the first vntill B. Queene Mary the Martyr, our Gracious soueraygne his Mother, few other Mothers in our age being worthy of such a Sonne, few other Sonnes worthy of such a Mother. 4. I prooue by the Scripture twenty foure substantiall points of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth the rest being easily deduced out of those, &amp; the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which I prooue at length. 5. I chalenge the Ministers to improue any of those 24. articles, and to be contrary to the expresse word of the Bible, which they shall neuer be able to do. 6. I challeng them likewise to proue any one point of their Religion, as set downe in the expresse word of their own Bible, which being impossible for them to do, I force them to auow that they preach not the Bible, not the expresse word, not the Scripture, but their owne fancies, yea old rotten &amp; condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, which they call their consequences drawne out of the Bible. 7. I set downe those same 24. substantiall points of our Catholike Religion proued by the holy Fathers of the first hundred yeares, putting downe most faithfully their owne words, sayings, &amp; consequences drawne out of the expresse word of the Bible; being a thing so notorious, that a man who hath any reason, iudgmēt, or vnderstanding, any feeling of God, or care of his conscience, should willingly prefer the consequences of these holy, wise, learned &amp; ancient Fathers before the stinking puddle of cōse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Ministers, who are children without Fathers, &amp; preachers without commission, or any warrant in the word of God 8. I shew how the ministers haue falsified the Bible in all those places which make for vs Catholiks against thē. Finally &amp; last of all, I proue that the Church of God in this &amp; the other ensuing Ages, was a known generation, society &amp; congregation of Pastours &amp; people, Parents &amp; Children, Heades and members successiuely propagated &amp; iointly vnited without interruptiō one frō the other; which must needs still perseuere constant &amp; faithful, what opposition soeuer be made against it. And on the contrary I shew, that the Ministers of Scotlād, England, or Ireland can shew no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
<pb facs="39"/> of their religion, no not one before Luther &amp; Caluin, who do agree with them in all essentiall points of fayth, concluding therby that they are vnkind slipps grafted by Sathan, of whom the Wiseman saith:<note n="(a)" place="margin">
         <hi>Sap. v.</hi> 1.4.</note>
      <hi>Bastard plants shall not take deep roote, nor lay sure foundation: &amp; if in the boughes for a time they shall spring, being weakly set, they shall be moued of the wind, &amp; by the vehemency of the winds they shall be rooted out.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Consider Christian Reader I pray thee, if in the case of some tēporall State any Lord or Earle of Scotland to prooue the tytle of the lands he holds, should produce the publike sentence, not only of all the Iudges of Scotland for the space of fourteen hundred yeares, but of all the world for the space of fifteen hundred years: the sentence, I say, iudicially deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the presence of all those Kinges, &amp; of the three Estates of all those Christian Kingdomes in fauour of the true Possessour of the land, condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the aduerse party of imposture &amp; intrusion: &amp; this their decision, sentence &amp; condemnation in diuers recordes amongst the publike mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents not only of that one Kingdom, but likwise of the whole world to be extant: And on the other side the aduerse party could bring forth none of former tymes to speake in his fauour, alledging only that all his Forefathers &amp; keepers of the land, were &amp; had been inuisible, vnknown &amp; latent; what Iudge, I pray you, what reasonable Man would make doubt who had the better right in Law? So it is betwixt vs Catholiks &amp; the Protestants: for we produce for our Religion the Iudiciall sentence not only of all the Kings &amp; spirituall Iudges of our Kingdom of Scotland iudicially pronounced, but of the whole world, and that not at one tyme but at seueral, for the space of fifteen hundred years; iudicially I say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, &amp; all accepted, ratifyed, executed, &amp; by publike monuments testified. The Ministers in the contrary can name no visible predecessors for their Religion, yea bring nothing but their own phancies &amp; inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ōs, vnder the Childish pretext of the word of God; bring no Iudiciall sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen in their behalfe by either Coūsell, or Parlament, or Publike monument, shew vs no Author, name vs no writter, specifie no marke or token of the being of their Religion before Luther and Caluin: shall then any reasonable Man thinke such Ministers &amp; preachers to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right or Commission to preach, to haue any ground in the word of God, any warrant for their religion, any antiquity or lineall succession.</p>
   <p>Wherfore I earnestly intreate the Christian Reader to giue place to reason, &amp; to eschew their new Religion &amp; profession, if he will auoyd his eternall ruine, &amp; losse of euerlasting saluation, which is the due &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable reward allotted for misbelieuers: from the which Christ Iesus free all them who are effectually desirous to liue, &amp; dye in the true and Catholike Church, Amen. With the which desire, I rest alwayes,</p>
