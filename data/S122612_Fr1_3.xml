   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight gentle Reader, in all nations, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Common wealthes, although barbarous, yet in respect of the office of Harold, Pursiuant, Messenger, or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, they alwayes beare with patience and take in good parte, all actions both of worde and deede, appertayning vnto his office: And somtimes of theyr owne noblenesse, do bountifully rewarde the same, although he vtter vnto them matter both opprobrious and spitefull. And also <hi>Gueuara</hi> maketh report, that it was a law amōg the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that no man whatsoeuer, shoulde aduenture to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche the Emperours tent in the nyght and tyme of warre vpon payne of death. The Emperor <hi>Aurelius</hi> as then making warre with <hi>Zenobia</hi> Queene of <hi>Palmiris,</hi> it chaunced, that a certaine Greeke souldier was apprehended within the compasse of the same, being committed to be executed for his offence, the Emperour himselfe from within his Pauilion with a lowde voyce cryed out and sayd, <hi>If his approche were for himselfe, let him dye for it, but if it be for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him liue.</hi> The matter beyng searched and examined, it was founde, that he came to sue for his twoo fellowes that were taken sleeping in the watche, which after whipping shoulde haue bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the enimies. And so it came to passe, that the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er escaped death, his fellowes deliuered from punishment, and the Emperor of clemencie obteined immortall renoune. Of all which premisses, me thinketh I gather vnto my selfe, a safetie and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from all iniurie, bothe of worde and deede of all manner of men, not vnreasonable, which in this matter haue vsed but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of messenger, interpreter, &amp; soliciter: but to my owne payne, and thy profite, beeing vtterly without doubt to be requited with thy ingratitude. And whereas but with suche time as was rather stretched vnto the liking of him that myght command them mete for the matter, I haue not onely corrected, but also performed the translation of the firste booke of the familiar Epistles of <hi>Gueuara,</hi> that were not translated, and further finding certaine Epistles and
<pb facs="5"/>
disputations of the sayde auctor, by no man as yet translated, wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and as it might seeme taking leaue: I thought it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to entertaine the same with my simple English speach, thā to hazard the losse of so rare, singular, diuine, &amp; most necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therin cōteyned, although but with my poore abilitie: flatly confessing that I want both glosse &amp; hew of rare eloquence, vsed in the polishing of the rest of his workes: neuerthelesse most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely affirming, that it goeth agreable vnto the author thereof. For due commendations whereof, for want of tyme I shall yeelde no other wordes, than be conteyned in my former Preface, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: Being furnished so fully with syncere doctrine, so vnvsed eloquence, so high a stile, so apte similitudes, so excellent discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so conuenient examples, so profounde sentences, so old anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, so ancient histories, such varietie of matter, so pleasant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, so strange things alledged, &amp; certaine parcelles of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with such dexteritie hādled, that it may hardly be discerned, whether shal be greater, either thy pleasure by reding, or profit by following the same. Like as in a most curious shop furnished with incōparable drugs, &amp; most precious spices, both to preserue health, as also to expell most pestilent diseases: euen so heerein is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be founde, things not only precious to conserue, but also to remedy the contagion of any estate both in peace &amp; warre. As rules for Kings to rule, counsellers to counsell, magistrates to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, prelates to practise, captaines to execute, souldiers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, the married to follow, the prosperous to prosecute, and the poore in aduersitie to be cōforted, wherein he delicately toucheth with most curious sayings, &amp; no lesse philosophie, how to write or talke with all men, in all matters at large, with matter so apte, so learned, so merry, and also so graue, with instruction of behauiour, with thy better, with thy equal, with thy friend, with thy foe, with thy wife, seruaunte, and children: That for prayse and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, wordes most certainly, and also tyme may want, but not matter and iust occasion to commend the same. Commending the rest vnto thy good consideration, and yeelding my selfe vnto thy mildnesse, grace, and fauour, I commit thee to the liuing God, to whome be prayse for euermore.</p>
