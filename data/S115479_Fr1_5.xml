That night, the King (indisposed to sleepe) reades the Chronicles, where hee findes, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> discouered a Treason; which seruice the King intending to reward, askes <hi>Haman</hi> (who then came to beg <hi>Mordecai's</hi> life) what Worship best befits him that the King meanes to honour? <hi>Haman</hi> (supposing himselfe the man) spake largely: whereupon the King commands him to doe that very honour to <hi>Mordecai:</hi> So <hi>Haman</hi> goes home discomforted, and is straight sent for to attend the King to the Queenes Feast; where (in his presence) the King vrges the Queene to mooue her suit; whereupon shee humbly begs hers, and her peoples life, which <hi>Haman</hi> sought to betray: wherat the King is inraged, &amp; cōmands <hi>Haman</hi> to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Gallowes which he built for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and giues his Estate to the Queene, and his Honour to <hi>Mordecai:</hi> The Queene earnestly requests the King, that he would reuerse the letters which <hi>Haman</hi> had deuised for the Iewes destruction: the King referres it to the Queene, and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who sent Letters in the Kings name, that the Iewes should defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues on the day that <hi>Haman</hi> had appoynted for their slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; vpon which day the Iewes slay in <hi>Susa</hi> fiue hundred men, and the ten sonnes of <hi>Haman,</hi> and in the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces 70000. Whereupon the Queene desires the King, that the next day the Iewes might likewise defend themselues from their enemies: and that the dead sons of <hi>Haman</hi> may be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp; all which the King grants: so as the Iewes slew the next day in <hi>Susa, 300.</hi> men, and <hi>Hamans</hi> ten sons were hanged vp; whereupon the Feasts of <hi>Purim</hi> are instituted, and in the Kings name confirmed for euer.</p>
