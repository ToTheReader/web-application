      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou that shall happen to light on this little
peece of a booke, how you will or can iudge
of what you read, I know not: if it be well I
am glad you are pleased, if otherwise, it is
past the print, and therefore too late to be
mended: many things are comprehended in a little roome,
and he that reades all and takes good by none at all, I am
perswaded is either vncapable or careles: to be short, such
as they be I send them to you, set downe with the dayes in
the yeare: in halfe one day you may read them, and euer
after thinke on them as you can conceiue, disgest, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them: some of them were written by wiser men
then my selfe, and for the rest (like wares in a shop) the good
must help away with the bad: To conclude, I commend
them with my further loue and seruice, to the fauour of
those spirits, that iudging the best, will not say the worst:
among whome, hoping you are one to fill
vp the number of honest
men, I rest.</p>
