FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE
BY THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, LORD
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBVRIE,
Primate and Metropolitane of all ENGLAND, and
one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie
COVNCELL.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Reuerend, Dutie makes
me bold, euen at my first looking
and leaping out of the dungeon of
Obscuritie, which hitherto had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
me, to interrupt your more
serious affaires, with the view of
these my labours. It is not their
worth, but your worthinesse that causeth this presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For to whom should I rather present my <hi>first-fruits,</hi>
      
then vnto the High Priest, <hi>That hee might shake
them before the Lord, to make them acceptable?</hi>
      
Neither is any meeter to Patronise a Historie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
then he, to whose Person Religion giueth, and from
the same mutually receiueth, Patronage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I, the meanest of <hi>Leui's</hi> sonnes, doe here offer vnto
your Grace, <hi>ASIA, AFRICA,</hi> and <hi>AMERICA,</hi>
      
and that in their withered and fouler hue of passed

<pb facs="3"/>
      
out-worne rites, or present Irreligious Religions; not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with the purer streames of sacred Baptisme.
<hi>EVROPE</hi> challengeth a roome in this kind by her selfe:
nor would <hi>Christian Historie</hi> vouchsafe these <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
      
her holy companie, and therefore hath enioyned me a
second Pilgrimage, and Perambulation ouer the World,
to trace her footsteps, and obserue euery where her Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Corrupters, and Reformers.</p>
   <p>Great is this burthen of atwofold World, and requires
both an <hi>Atlas</hi> and an <hi>Hercules</hi> too, to vndergoe it. The
newnesse also makes it more difficult, being an enterprise
neuer yet (to my knowledge) by any, in any language, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted;
conioyning thus <hi>Antiquitie</hi> and <hi>Moderne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
      
in the obseruations of all the rarities of the World,
and especially of that soule of the world, <hi>RELIGION.</hi>
      
Yet haue I aduentured, and (I speake it not to boast, but
to excuse my selfe, in so haughtie designes) this my <hi>first
Voyage</hi> of Discouerie, besides mine owne poore stocke
laide thereon, hath made mee indebted to seuen hundred
Authors, of one or other kind, in I know not how many
hundreds of their Treatises, Epistles, Relations and
Histories, of diuers subiects and Languages, borrowed
by my selfe; besides what (for want of the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues)
I haue taken vpon trust, of other mens goods in
their hands. Wherein had I enioyed that <hi>Academicke</hi>
      
leisure,
<q>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </q>
      
Or the benefits of greater Libraries, or conference with
men more skilful: my <hi>Braine</hi> might haue yeelded a fairer
issue, a more compleate and better-armed <hi>Minerua.</hi>
      
But besides the want of these, the daily cares of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,

<pb facs="3"/>
      
the weekly dueties (in Preaching and Catechising)
of my Ministerie, the grossenesse of the Aire where I
liue, which (some say) makes a duller wit, I am sure, a
sicklier body; maypleade excuse for me. If not,
<q>Clades Authore leuatur,</q>
      
The <hi>World</hi> is the weight that presseth me, and my booke
shall haue this praise in the greatest dispraise,
<q>Magnis tamen excidit ausis.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Howsoeuer; I shall thinke my selfe happie in your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Examination and Censure, if it be not Impietie in me
to offer to intercept, and with interposition of these lines a
while to Eclipse, your Gracious aspect and influence vnto
our Church and State. And though your Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
for more necessarie imployments, and needes not, as
knowing them better alreadie, afford your <hi>Precious
time</hi> to these things of baser worth: Yet if your Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
shall vouchsafe them as Remembrancers, out of my
labours to refresh yours, I shall bee more then sufficiently
recompenced. Others may hence learne by that most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious,
though not mostlearned argument of <hi>Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
      
two lessons fitting these times, the <hi>Vnnaturalnesse</hi>
      
of <hi>FACTION</hi> and <hi>ATHEISME:</hi> That law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hauing written in the practise of all men (as we here
in the particulars doe shew) the profession of some Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and in that Religion, wheresoeuer any societie of
Priests or <hi>Religious</hi> persons, are, or haue beene in the
World, no admittance of <hi>Paritie;</hi> the Angels in Heauen,
Diuels in hell, (as the Royallest of Fathers, the Father
of our Countrie hath pronounced) and all Religions on
Earth, as here we shew, being equally subiect to inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that is, to the equitie of subordinate Order. And if I liue

<pb facs="4"/>
      
to finish the rest, I hope to shew the <hi>Paganisme</hi> of
Antichristian Poperie, and other Pseudo-Christian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies;
and the Truth of Christianitie as it is now profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and established in our Church, vnder the Great
<hi>Defender of the Faith:</hi> for whose long <hi>Raigne,</hi> and
your Graces prosperous seruice vnder so Religious a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
I heartily pray vnto the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Kings,</hi> and cheefe <hi>Shepheard</hi> of our
Soules, <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi>
      
Nouemb. <hi>5.
