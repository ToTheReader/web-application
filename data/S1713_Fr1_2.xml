Chiefly swelling with multiplicity of glorious titles, as one of the greatest monarchs of the earth, that being admired of all, his greatnesse might amaze all, and so by degrees seeking covertly to tyrannize over all, when as indeed [sic] and truth, the greatest part of his pretended greatnesse is but a windy crack of an ambitious minde</title>

   <p>GEntle Reader, although in respect of the Authours
absence, the copie now presented be not so compleat
throughout as it should; yet because (as we say in
the prouerb) <hi>Delayes are dangerous,</hi> specially in matters
of moment, and hoping it is not materially defectiue in any
thing, from the perfectest Copie or Authors minde, I haue
presumed to publish it as it is, wishing no lesse good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
then the Author himselfe intended; and so desiring my
upright meaning may be accepted in good part by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader, I bid thee Farewell.</p>
