   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, <hi>Abell Kitchin,</hi> Mayor; and the VVorshipfull, <hi>Christopher Cary,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Barker,</hi> Sheriffes of the Citty of BRISTOLL; health.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight VVorshipfull and VVorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, considering that the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romaines</hi> are plentifully stuffed with the records of their owne atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: whereby they haue not onely preserued their names, but haue also gotten thereby an euerlasting fame vnto all posterities: therefore hauing so fit an occasion to manifest my loue, and so worthy a subiect to expresse my dutie, I haue thought good to tempt your acceptance in this small presentment of her Maiesties royall Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which although it be not beautified with refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned words, nor yet sufficiently adorned with Poetical
<pb facs="3"/>
tearmes as the worthinesse of the subiect requireth, yet resting on your fauourable censures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, desiring you that euen as the skilfull Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metritian, who at the games of <hi>Olimpus</hi> by the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot gessed of the stature of his whole body: euen so by the outward view of this small trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise you would vouchsafe to measure the willingnes of mine inward intent, if that my power were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to my ready heart. I haue therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured, vnder your fauourable protection, for to lay open vnto the whole world, the truth of this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past Triumph, for three chiefe and especiall causes.</p>
   <p>First, that such a memorable example of sincere affection, by true and loyall Subiects expressed to their Soueraigne, should not be forgotten. Secondly, that it might be a meane to stirre vp all succeeding ages in imitation of the like, to shew both dutifull obedience, and ready seruice, vnto their gracious Prince. Thirdly, and lastly, that it might stop the slanderous mouthes of backe-biting and detracting Sichophants, who by secret Libels or open raylings oppose themselues alwayes against the truth: enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all those by the splendor of whose admired ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, their hypocriticall shewes of fained pietie are eclipsed.</p>
   <q>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <l>For, as the Sunne obscures all lesser Lights,</l>
      <l>So Vertues lustre dampes all Enuies sleights.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Finally, if you but daigne to shew a fauourable aspect vpon these Orphan-Lines, I will neyther feare the distaste of the <hi>Cinick,</hi> nor the sole conceite of the <hi>Censorious:</hi> for although many carpes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when curious eyes come a-fishing, yet our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience shall suppe vp, and make roome for better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, when <hi>Zo-ilus</hi> with his barkings, or <hi>Momus</hi> with his detractions, waites to serue the Table: meane while prostituting these rude Lines to the sole approbation of your iudicious Censures, and my selfe to your Seruice, I rest</p>
