      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as I had finished this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, there came vnto mee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons of the Countie and confines where I dwelled, with a written Paper in their hands, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying therein what paines and cost they had vndertaken, and what troubles they had endured in seeking to redesse, or at the least to restraine the Transportation of Corne, and all other victualls, (fruite on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly except) from the Townes of <hi>Bewdley, Tewxburie,</hi> and the Citties of <hi>VVorcester</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> vnto <hi>Bristowe,</hi> &amp;c. wherein also it appeared, that by the good meanes &amp; care of some of the higher powers; they had obtained Letters of commannd to the Iustices of Peace within the countie of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to appoint certaine honest and
<pb facs="39"/> substantiall men to be searchers of all such boates or vessels as should passe on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Seauerne, frō any of the foresaid pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to another place, by which good means it hath pleased God somewhat to mittigate the dayly encreasing price of corn &amp; graine amongst vs.</p>
   <p>But for as much as it was giuen mee, to vnderstand at the same time, by those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that came to sollicit this cause; that the most part of those persons so appointed by the Iustices to be searchers, were very weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men; that is to say either great Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisters, or cloathiers, &amp; therfore for their owne parts, had no greate cause to indure the paines, which was needeful in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to bee taken; &amp; the rest of thē being of meaner condition &amp; state and therfore not so wel able to beare the daily charges about this employment (as beeing more desirous to haue it better effected, then the rest) craued the Assistance of the Parishes and Towne-shippes adioyning, by some beneuolent collection, for the suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their expences, promising with all, a more diligent and dayly attendance vppon
<pb facs="39"/> the said search. The which their so honest, needfull, and necessarie a Petition, I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presentlye tendered to make knowne; but also for the better continuance therof, I thought good to giue some intelligence heerein, that euerie good Christian, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regardeth the crie of the poore, or the loue of his Neighbour, may put to his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, to so good and charitable an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore now in as much as it hath pleased God by the Doctrine of his word to giue vs the true knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the verie originall cause of this present dearth, and both opened and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs the meanes to preuent and take away the same; Let vs not be slacke to ioyne both heart and hand, purse and prayer, minde &amp; money for the speedy redressing of this euill, so iustly imposed and laide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, for such causes as haue bene by vs committed.</p>
   <p>God graunt that wee bee not receiuers of the grace of God in vaine, nor turne his gace into Wantonnesse, least while we say peace, peace, the Lord of Hostes come
<pb facs="40"/> against vs with his great Armie, the sound of a Trumpet, voice of an Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, consuming fire, and such like.</p>
