   <p>WHereas diuers ignoraunt in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethmaticke
and Geomatrie, thinke it a
hard thing to describe that smal worke of mine,
intituled the Terrar, which I set foorth the last
yeare, 1582. And the rules thereof so hard, that
they cannot be learned without tedious trauel.
Truely (gentle Reader) were it not for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
words of Art, they were most pleasant &amp;
easie. And for proofe thereof if thou canst but
reade: I haue appointed one whome you may
hear off, at the signe of the Lamb near Clemēts
Inne, who shall teach thee so much Arethma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
and Geomitry in one day, hauing a good
capasity, as shall describe the sayde Terrar, the
Map of a Country, or any such like worke, with
the vse of the scale. And also he will teach thee
any thing mentioned in it, to be taught with as
much expedition as thou wouldest wishe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me not before thou hast tried me, &amp; then
report as thou findest me. I know some that
would haue none cunning but them selues, who
would make mountaynes of their mould hilles.
Such will smoothly laugh me to scorne. But I
trust the modest minded by proofe will be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of my truth. And as touching the rest of
the twentye and fiue deuises which I offer to
teach in the sayd Terrar, I promise thee, there is
not one amongst them all, but is as easie to be
learned as any of the workes herein described
VVherefore let not wordes of Art dismay thee,
nor those that would haue all men ignorant but
them selues discourage thee: but lay hold on slip
pery time, which once mispent may no way be
reuolked. And consider with the Ant, that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
haruest, wil prouide both foode and fyer for
winter cold. And thus fare well in Christ. From
Paines End, the 16. of Nouember. 1583.</p>
   <p>VVhereas the sayd Terrar was solde for two
shillinges six pence, contrary to the Aucthours
minde, from hence foorth they shall be sold by
retaile for sixe pence a peece, you maye haue
them at my Printers.</p>

in the making of ponds vpon high &amp; dry groūds
by me already published in print. VVhich skill
is needefull for them that will drayne bogs and
weate groundes, for the better finding of the
most conuenient currant, to conuay the water
away. It is learned with twice reading ouer of
tenne lines.</p>
