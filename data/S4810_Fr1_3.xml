      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore that you</hi> enter (beloued Christian) into the reading of Sainct Paules Epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, which (by the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent and opinion of the ancient and holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) is the very summe and perfection of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scriptures: thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test diligently call to thy remembrance, the firste and originall sin, of our olde father Adam in Paradis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> through which, he there felt the iustice of God, and was of him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly banished from infinite pleasures, of that moste séemely and beautifull place, of all places and pleasure vpon the earth. In which notable case and high mysterie, whē thou shalt once perceiue the vprightnesse, greate goodnesse and the mercie of God on the one side: and the slippernesse, disobedience and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse of Adam on thother side: thou shalt then the more easily come to the true meaning and vnderstanding of the said Epistle: the effect of which is, most principally to declare vnto all men, the foresaide highe and notable mysterie. For after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of his great goodnesse had created Adam, farre pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all other his creatures, in the excellencie of his creation: and had also (but of very base and vile matter) made him vnto his owne godly im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> and similitude: resembling therein his diuine maiestie in heauen, and moste godly perfection of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, wherwith he was highly endued at his first originall and beginning: he then placed him in a most pleasant Paradise of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oy and singular comfort: and gaue frée choise and libertie vnto him, to vse all things there at pleasure, and to his owne
<pb facs="7"/> hartes desire: saue only he forbad him to eate of the frute of the knowledge of good and euil, which was of most amiable apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, beautifull to beholde, and most pleasantly placed in the middest of Paradise. The commaundement heereof, was not burdenous or vnreasonable for man to beare: but only reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted therein due obedience and loue towardes his louing God and maker: vnto whome only, that noble creature man (aboue all other creatures) should haue had most speciall regarde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering moste déepely in him selfe the excellencie of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that so graciously formed him, blessed him, and moste plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly placed him: and there to looke for al goodnesse only at his holy hand: &amp; not to take as it were vpon him selfe by his owne woorthynesse, the forme of goodnesse and euill: but should onely haue holden that for euil and forbidden, which God restrained as euill, and to count that only for good and rightuous, which of God is allowed, and graunted. God therefore toke Adam, and to put him out of all doutes, brought him to the same place, and shewed him the very trée and the frute therof, standing in the middest of the Garden of pleasure, and forbad him the eating thereof with an earnest charge and threatning, saying on this wise vnto him: In what so euer houre thou shalt eate the frute of that trée, thou shalt surely die, &amp; be subiect to eternall deathe. Yet notwithstanding this straighte restrainte of God, Adam stackered, and dealt but slipperly, vntruely, and carelesly, with his faithful God and maker, transgressing his holy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and gaue more credit to the persuasion of the woman and of the wicked serpent, than to the truthe of Gods woorde and his holy commaundement. Whiche was nothing else but euē so much as in them did lie, to take vnto thēselues the form of good and euil as out of them selues, or by some other meane, rather than of God their maker: vnto whose only wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they should most humbly haue yéelded their obedience: as vnto him, who alwayes most gratiously wisheth all goodnesse vnto euery man. For he being by the woman and the serpent deceiued, thought that God was not indifferent towards him, but that be had rather of sette purpose, withdrawne from him, some parcell of his diuine and godly wisedome. Therefore, for
<pb facs="7"/> as muche as in mind he was thus deceiued, sodenly chaunged, and departed now from God, declaring thereby his vnstayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, infidelitie, and vnfaythfulnesse: and looked not for all good things only at his gracious hands, as of duetie he should, but yelded to the Diuell, receiued that was offered, and tasted to his condemnation of that strayt forbidden fruite, to aduance and set forwardes him selfe, to the presence and secrete high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods mightie maiestie: and that rather by some bye way with his owne will and consente, then contenting him selfe with the onely will of God: and so to recouer thereby as he thought, the fulnesse of his necessitie and lacke of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: which he then imagined to be muche wanting in him selfe. And thus with his forgetfulnesse, haughtinesse of heart, infidelitie, slipperines, disobedience &amp; vnthankfulnesse against his God and Maker (and deserued therby his iust vengeance, and to be for euer the fyrebrande of hell, euer burning, euer dying, and neuer to dye the seconde death) he yet fastened vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon life, which he moste happily receiued, through the onely compassion and great mercy of God: who notwithstanding, offence so gréeuously committed agaynst him, wherby eternall damnation was due to the offendour, and to become a bonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue vnto the Diuell for euer, to whom he so willingly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so diligently obeyed beléeued, folowed, and serued: yet (as is sayde) so great and vnspeakable was the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, so infinitely his loue abounded, and so tender he was ouer him, and so sorowfull for his gréeuous fall from blisse, into perdurable tormente and paine, and to redeeme him agayne from it, and from the diuell: that he moste certaynely decréed with him selfe to curse his owne deare sonne, and to pushe him as it were forwards by the shoulders, to most cruel death for the recouering agayne of man: And so through his sonnes moste paynefull death and passion, to saue mankinde from euerlasting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ath and damnation, which Adam himselfe and his whole posteritie fell into, through the infection of his pride, disobedience, and loosenesse of heart agaynst God. Euen here verily (as ye perceiue) had the iuste God iuste occasion by iustice, iustly to expell man, to confounde him, to damne
<pb facs="8"/> him, and to leaue him vtterly destitute of his grace, and to yéelde him to the Diuell for euer: for so did his righteousnesse and truthe require. Consider, these were the wordes that God spake vnto him: I tell thée Adam, in what soeuer houre thou eatest of the fruite, thou shalt surely dye the death. How beit, the great goodnesse and mercy that was in God, called him backe from moste seuere iustice, and required not vtter reuengemente, and thereby to suppresse man, a very frayle, poore, and naked creature. In the meane tyme therfore, God found out the very true and ready way, whereby his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse &amp; truth might fully to effect be satisfied, and wherein also the swéetenesse of his mercy shoulde specially be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and declare foorth the mightinesse of it selfe: that is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, the onely Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Chryst: which (as I sayde before) was willingly pushed vnto deathe, to deliuer Adam and his whole posteritie from their sinne and damnation, through the onely fauour and mercies sake of God the eternall father. Therefore bicause mankinde coulde in no wyse be saued and deliuered fréely from sinne, death, and the Diuell, and so made agayne at one with his so louing and faythfull a God, as he shewed hym selfe vnto Adam his firste creature, but onely by Chryst Iesus hys owne and onely Sonne: Chryst dyd moste willingly ioyne in consente with his father, and so tooke vppon him selfe the rigour of his fathers terrible sentence, pronounced iustely agaynst Adam, &amp; the curse of the whole lawe vpon his owne backe, and dyed Adams due death, for him and for vs all, that were by him in the lyke state of damnation. For euen so sayth the Prophete: Cursed is he that hangeth on trée. Wée be now therefore redéemed agayne by Chrystes death, from our bondage, and from the seruyce and slauerie of the Diuel, and from that most bitter curse, that was proper vnto Adam and to all his ofspring. Wée are also by Chryst, taken out of the kingdome of darknesse, and placed through his onely deserte in the cleare lighte, and in the moste glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse kingdome of our eternall and louing God. In thys maner passing now further on my purpose, the gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="8"/> shall take the speciall meaning of the holy Apostle in his Epistle on thys wyse: whyche is, that all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men muste wholly depende vppon the mercy of God, throughe hys deare Sonne Iesus Chryst, for the fulnesse of their eternall redemption, and by hys onely merites to attayne their eternall saluation. And that all suche, as looke to come vnto it by their owne merites, deseruings, and woorkinges, are in that poynte lyke vnto their father Adam: whiche, in hys pride and disobedience, went about to come to the Maiestie of God, through his owne deuises, vayne byewayes, and very fonde attemptes, at what tyme he moste vnlawefully yéelded to eate the fruite, that was moste lawfully of God forbidden him. All which proud attempters, may be wel assured to abide also the like cursse that was giuen to Adam, but not a blessing, or the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that of God was mercyfully promysed, and that onely by the merytes of Iesus Chryst: onlesse they will beginne to repente of their pride, blindenesse and disobedience, and onely referre it to our mercyfull God him selfe, throughe the onely faythe and beléefe due from them to our Lorde Iesus Chryste: who onely satisfieth the truthe and iustice of GOD in thys poynte, whiche sayde vnto Adam: In what so euer houre thou eatest of the fruyte, thou shalte surely dye the death. By which onely satisfaction of Chryst, all men (euen as Adam) bée reconciled agayne vnto God the father, their sinnes fréely remytted, and come boldely agayne to the presence of hys maiestie, and not by our owne deuises and foolishe inuentions, as (the more pitie it is) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men moste blindly doo, that beareth at this day the names of Chrystians. Wherefore, in as muche as it was then concluded, that Chryst was the very perfecte waye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store man agayne to his perfect ioy and felicitie, which before he had loste: It was thought of God almightie méete and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to sende vnto him a lawe before the comming of the sauiour Chryst: which might put him daily in mynde of his fall from the ioyes, wherein God had once moste happily placed hym, as also to lay playne open before his face his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
<pb facs="9"/> pride, disobedience and wretched liuing. For which cause, many hundreth yeres after the fall of Adam, was thys Lawe proclaymed by the Patriarke Moyses, written and set foorth in Tables and Bookes: to the ende that by the strayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, all men mighte knowe, not onely the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God ouer them, but also their owne naughtie nature, weakenesse, blyndenesse, and myserable state through their disobedience and sinne: which before the Lawe came, hadde welnighe forgotten their deadly fall, and knew not in effecte what sinne was, they were so wretchedly blinded in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their pride and false imaginations. To the ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all creatures should know their owne case and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, their damnable state and condition, the laws was proclaymed: which, besides that it manyfested vnto vs the wonderfull mercy of God towards vs, as also the state of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam our first parent, and the filthynesse of all our sinfull and abhominable liuing, and the giuing furthermore vnto vs such precepts and commaundements of vertuous conuersation and liuing, as alwayes is séemely for godly men to vse: by the which, all men at all times should haue rectified and amended their vngodly liues. It also prescribed certayne Ceremonies, which men dayly exercise among them selues: taking the same, and stedfastely also beléeuing, that they dyd but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate the deathe of the same Chryst, which was promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to dye the deathe, in the behalfe of Adam and his whole pasteritie: wherein, if men in tymes passed dyd vse among them selues, according to this sense and meaning, they were founde righteous before God: not for dooing the Ceremonies, but onely for their beléefes sake, which they conceyued in Chryst to come: whom onely the Ceremonies dyd but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefigurate.</p>
   <p>Al which ceremonies (sayth S. Paule) should vtterly now cease, and stande no more in effect amongste christen men: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as nowe the very truthe and thing it selfe is already come and shineth amongste vs, which they before only prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. And euen thus did God most louingly, sée to the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe of his decayed Creatures, that so muche had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb facs="9"/> him, in their loosenesse and falling from him. And for which only cause, his own and only deare sonne was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, toke vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>uel death. Wherfore, God now at this time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing else at our handes, but to haue alwayes res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnto his mercy thorow Iesus Christ, and to beholde also his wonderfull loue towardes vs: to the ende we should be ashamed of our owne sinfull actes, how ofte so euer we turne our mindes from him, through the committing of vice, which is displeasant, abhominable, &amp; alwayes damnable in his sight. Also, howe that we should meekely acknowledge and confesse daily vnto him, our owne sinnefull liues, the miserablenesse of our nature, &amp; how of our selues we are not able, to thinke, speake, nor do any good thing: and not stubbernly to do as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam did, run from the face of God, hide our sinnes from him, or else couer them from his presence w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our own vaine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For Adam, at what time he knewe that he had offended and broken his commaundement, he perceiued immediately what state he stoode in, and by the accusation of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he felte in him selfe the pricke of sinne, he began then to be trudging, and to hide him selfe from him, and soughte meanes to couer him selfe, althoughe with moste simple and very slender clothing, which he then accordingly but litle tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vnto like as it is all vnprofitable that man of hys owne braine wil deuise to cloke his sinne with all, although both he and his make flie neuer so fast from the face of the Lord, and seeke meanes to hide them selues. But yet notwithstanding all this saide disobedience, hautie, and proude stubbernesse of Adam: which after he had most wretchedly offended, chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hide him self from God, than meekely to acknowledge his fault before him: the louing Lord was stricken so full of compassion and mercy towards man, his simple, naked, and poore creature, that he quickely folowed, and hastened him self after that fugitiue and runnagate found him quickly but, conferred most mildly with him, put him in minde of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, great myserie, and the happie life that he miserably had falne from, and saide on this wise to him: Adam where arte
<pb facs="10"/> thou? which should signifie vnto him: O Adam, knowest thou what thou hast done? hast thou considered wel with thy self of thy present state, and what miserie thou art now falne into frō thine innocencie, blissefull state and felicitie, by cōtempt of my wil and commaundement? At these wordes now should Adam haue bene abashed, quickned to memorie, stirred to trembling, earnestly moued to méekenesse and obedience, and reuerently at the foote of his maker, to acknowledge &amp; confesse his fault, to crie <hi>peccaui,</hi> and to ask for mercy. But he contrariwise shewed him selfe stoute and stiffe necked. And the louing Lord yet still applied him, and moued him with these words folowing, which should haue pierced euen throughe the very harte of man, if he would haue shewed him selfe tractable and gentle, rather than proud and stubburn, and said vnto him: O Adam, who told thée now that thou art naked? In which few words, priuie &amp; mighty checke, although it were most mildely and gently vttred of the Lord (bicause he wold not vtterly discorage the pore creature, in whose face he only behelde his owne similitude:) yet the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrete and very forgetful Adam of the great benefits of God, and his owne happy state, shoulde foorthwith haue called to his remembrance, the great goodnesse of his mercifull maker, and the miserable estate that he was then presently come vnto. But Adam would yet minde no such thing at all, but stoode (as he thought in his owne fight,) very well and in good plighte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yet naked, or most slenderly shrouded with a fewe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leaues, to couer his misery and filthy apparant nakednesse. Then the Lorde to helpe him yet further in this matter, and to pricke him forwardes to the confession of his sinne, said on this wise: Tell me Adam: Haste thou not in déede eaten of the trée, wherof I earnestly forbad thée, and charged thée vpon a sharpe penaltie that thou shouldest not eate thereof? But yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, man was loth to acknowledge his sinne, and for a further excuse or delay therin, he put the blame in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the woman. And the same did he with vnaduised and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward words: wherby, euery man may easily sée, that secretely in his corrupted hart, he laide the fault most wickedly vpon the maiestie of God him selfe. For he sayde not thus simply vnto
<pb facs="10"/> the Lord: The woman gaue me of the trée to eate: but proudly he added thereunto: The woman which thou gauest vnto me. As though he wold haue saide: thou thy selfe art faultie of this euill: for if thou haddest not giuen vnto me this woman, I had not bene thus deceiued, nor broken in this wise thy foresayde commaundement. And yet (vnderstand yée) the rightuous God gaue him not the woman to deceiue him, but to be vnto him an helper. Wherfore, it is now so much the more plain &amp; euident, that the sin of man was the more hainous, apparantly wilful &amp; greuous. By which this notable historie of the fal of mā, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dētly taught vnto al christen men, how mighty, great and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the mercy of god was towards vs of his part, as also what louing instructiōs he giueth hereby vnto vs: that we shuld ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more méekely and humbly thanke him, &amp; alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge before him, our most sinful &amp; abhominable state of life. And euen so shall all we receiue in time, the iust reward of méeknesse and true obedience towards God, through his sonne Iesus Christ: by whose only death, merites and deseruings, we be al brought to true health and saluation, and not by any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that commeth of oure selues: for the power of oure owne woorkes can no more further vs vnto our heauenly felicitie to come, than did the works of Adam, when he proudly did eat the apple, to the ende he might therby haue brought him selfe vnto the high maiestie and presence of God: but they do rather make our case damnable in his sight, if we haue any confidēce eyther in thē, or in any thing else, saue only in our Lord Iesus Christ: from whence only cōmeth all felicitie, eternall ioy &amp; saluation. For to speake moste truely and vnfainedly in this matter: the worthinesse of our works can no more couer or hide our sinnes from the displesure of the iust God, than did y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> said leaues couer Adam from the presence of his Deitie. Therfore we must thus truly count of our selues to be nothing else, but sinfull, blinde, stubburn &amp; disobedient wretches: and for the only mercies sake of God (in Iesus Christ, we be al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> children of saluation, if we do truely beléeue in him. Furthermore, to helpe the Reader in this said Epistle, I wil touch yet one thing most worthy of him to be noted: that is, like as the stubbornesse of Adam in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, wold haue laid the ground of his offence vpō god himselfe.

For although, God by his most high, heauenly and profound wisdome, knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how all things would come to passe: yet we cannot ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, that he was the occasion of any euill: euen as Adam could not iustly lay it to his charge, that he was the occasion of his fall, bicause he gaue him the womā which did so deceiue him: for God gaue hir vnto Adam, only to be his helper, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and succorer, and not to be an instrument of euil, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for his destruction: but the fault was in Adam him selfe, bicause he abused the holy precept and high gift of God. Also, we may say, that God foreknewe the fall of Aungels out of heauen: yet was he not thereby noted to be guiltie of that crime: for he had giuen vnto them all frée choise, as wel to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the good, and to eschue the doing of euill: as to doe euill of themselues, and to die from good. But they, through the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>o restrayne them from their sinnes, and to draw them from the stubbornesse of their euill enclined natures, that they should not (if it were possible) fal from him at any time. God truely, as a God of mercy, did for his parte that which was well séeming to the vttermoste poynt, but they woulde not so take it at his mercifull hands. Therefore, in their sinne of contempt they still slipt from grace, they fell farre from their God, and denied also his sonne Iesus Chryst, that came to redéeme both them and all mankinde, as you haue heard before. And the effecte of this matter shall the Reader haue more perfectly discussed in his place folowing of this sayde Epistle, which I thought héere sufficiente inoughe onely to touche, and to put him in minde thereof agaynst he come to the texte it selfe. Therefore, séeing we haue now brought it vnto this conclusion, that God truely is cleare, and not to be blamed for any mans fal, but saueth him frō it, euen through his great mercy in his onely sonne Iesus Chryst: we may not then leaue so muche to our selues, nor haue any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all in our owne workes, in our owne deuised toyes or vayne imaginations, neither yet in the kéeping of any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, whether they be of the law of Moses, or otherwise not: for Chryst in his comming and by his death, hath not onely taken vpon his backe the heauy burthen or most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible curse of the Law from them which beléeue in him: but hath also put cleane away all the Ceremonies thereof, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as by his comming now in our flesh all suche things are clearely finished, for whose onely cause they were firste made, and had therefore by him their shorter continuaunce. The circumcision therefore of the law, the feast of the newe Moone, the Iewish Sabbat dayes, with all the reste of suche obseruances and Ceremonies, are vtterly now to be bany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and neuer henceforth any more to be exercised among christian men, in the true Church of God and Chryst. For to vpholde (by any state) that those Ceremonies shoulde still continue amongst men and the professours of Chryst, is flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny the comming of Chryst into this worlde in our flesh, denying in effecte the vertue of his death, and therefore

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader should diligently remember, that the whole law of Moyses was proclaymed onely to the Iewes, which God tooke at that time for his owne and onely dearlings, and that the Gentiles had no parte thereof, but in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>ede thereof the law of nature, which is a naturall aptnesse or inclination to follow honest ciuilitie, to be gentle and of good behauiour.

      </gap>, which hath in it a certayne knowledge of God, as many of the Gentiles had, a certayne loue towardes him, to speake well of him, to cal dayly vpon him, to feare him, to loue their neighbours, and not to hurte the simple or their inferiour, with many other suche godly vertues of honestie or godly qualities: but the moste parte of them did abuse the same ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile and honest lawe which was giuen vnto them of God, to vse it to his glory and honor. And many of them also were so blinded in Idolatrie, false worshipping, and leaning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to their owne damnable imaginations, that they could not follow the nature of that lawe. Therfore S. Paule sayth: Though they had not the written law of Moyses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them, yet they were all saued or condemned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their lawe of nature, bicause it prescribed that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte to the Gentile, which the lawe of Moyses did vnto the
<pb facs="13"/> Iewes: and euen so all men were found sinfull and wretched before the face of God. But it was prouided through the wō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wisedome of God, that when the Iewes did forsake their owne profession, and denyed the sauioure Christe, that came to saue them and all mankinde, according to his fathers truth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thē this same law of Moses, and the frute of Christes comming, should be turned vnto the Gentiles, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion and saluation. Howe be it, this benefite of God, is not so to be taken, as though he had nowe broken promisse with the Iewes, or that they shuld vtterly be depriued of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and goodnesse: but that they may all haue, the profitte and commoditie therof as wel as the Gentiles, if they wil forsake in time their pride, malice and stoutnesse, and submit humbly them selues to the true faithe in Iesus Christe. And whereas Paule speaketh against the trust that the Iewes haue in their law and circumcision: he meaneth vnder the same, all kindes of Ceremonies and customes of religion, as yet be nowe vsed among Christen men. Thus, for the better declaration of all the premisses, I do entend to referre the Reader, vnto Sainct Paule him self, in his Epistle to the Romanes: which I haue according to the grace and gift giuē me of God, written more plainly out, than appeareth in the very bare text it self: which is no commentarie or glose vpon the said text: but as it were altogether one vniforme Epistle (or Paraphrase like) and in suche order so drawne out, neare to the nakednesse of the text it selfe, euen as though the Apostle him self did wholely write the same, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> euen so the Reader muste consider thereof and take it.
