   <head>On his beloved friend the Author, and his ingenious Poems.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>VVHat need these busy wits? who hath a Mine</l>
      <l>His owne, thus rich, needs not the scatter'd shine</l>
      <l>Of lesser heapes: Day dimmes a taper's light:</l>
      <l>And Lamps are uselesse, where there is no night.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Why then this traine of writers? forreigne verse</l>
      <l>Can adde no honour to a Poet's hearse,</l>
      <l>Whose every line, which he to paper lent,</l>
      <l>Builds for himselfe a lasting Monument.</l>
      <l>Brave verse this priviledge hath; Though all be dumbe,</l>
      <l>That is the Authors Epitaph and Tombe.</l>
      <l>Which when ambitious Pyles, th'ostents of Pride,</l>
      <l>To dust shall fall, and in their ruins hide</l>
      <l>Their then no more remembred Founders Name:</l>
      <l>These (like <hi>Apollo</hi> ever young) shall fame</l>
      <l>The first composer; whose weigh'd workes shall tell</l>
      <l>What Noble thoughts did in his bosome dwell.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But now I find the cause: they that doe praise</l>
      <l>Desert in others, for themselves plant Baies:</l>
      <l>For he that praises merit, loves it: thus</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="10"/>Hee's good, for goodnesse that's solicitous.</l>
      <l>Else, though Hee diamonds keenly pointed write,</l>
      <l>They but proclaime a quainter Hypocrite:</l>
      <l>Thus in the future, it shall honour bee,</l>
      <l>That men shall read their names bound up with thee,</l>
      <l>So country Moles, that would at Court appeare,</l>
      <l>Intrude some Camels traine that does live there.</l>
      <l>So Creatures that had drown'd else, did imbarke</l>
      <l>With <hi>Noah,</hi> and liv'd by being in his Arke.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Or if not thus; as when in Royall state</l>
      <l>Nobles attend Kings to inaugurate:</l>
      <l>Or as last yeare when you both courts did see</l>
      <l>Beget joyes noone in th'Vniversity;</l>
      <l>All the learn'd tribe in reverend Habits meet,</l>
      <l>As if the Schooles were turn'd into the street;</l>
      <l>Where each one strove such duty to put on,</l>
      <l>As might give honour to their own Sunnes Sunne.</l>
      <l>Such honour here our dimmer pennes would have,</l>
      <l>In pompe to wait him to his solemne grave:</l>
      <l>Since what he was, his own fruits better show,</l>
      <l>Then those which planted here, by others, grow.</l>
      <l>Rich jewels in themselves such lustre cast,</l>
      <l>As gold about them, is no grace, but Wast.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Such was his <hi>Genius:</hi> Like the eyes quick wink;</l>
      <l>Hee could write sooner, then an other think.</l>
      <l>His play was Fancies flame, a lightning wit,</l>
      <l>So shot, that it could sooner pierce, then hit.</l>
      <l>What e're he pleas'd, though but in sport to prove,</l>
      <l>Appear'd as true, as pitty dwells with love.</l>
      <l>Had he said thus, That discreet zeale might stan</l>
      <l>Both with the Iesuit, and the Puritan,</l>
      <l>T'had been believ'd; That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>tost from heat proceeds.</l>
      <l>That chastity from ease, and fulnesse breeds;</l>
      <l>That women ought to wooe, as <hi>Eve</hi> at first</l>
      <l>Woo'd Man, to make the world, and man accurst.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="11"/>All would be taken up for Truth: and sense</l>
      <l>Which knew Truth coming, would not going hence.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Had he maintain'd Rich <hi>Lucans</hi> worke had been</l>
      <l>Meere History; there would no pen be seen,</l>
      <l>To call it Poem. If for <hi>Caesar</hi> stood,</l>
      <l>Great <hi>Pompey</hi> should be neither weak, nor Good.</l>
      <l>Oh! had he liv'd to plead the craggy Law,</l>
      <l>Which now unsetled holds the world in awe▪</l>
      <l>He would have met some Ostracisme, I feare,</l>
      <l>Lest he had charm'd the purple Iudge to erre.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Nor could he only in his Native speech</l>
      <l>Robe his ripe thoughts; but even the Copious, Rich,</l>
      <l>And lofty Greek, with Latine, did appeare</l>
      <l>In him, as Orient in their proper sphere:</l>
      <l>That when in them, himselfe he pleas'd t' expresse;</l>
      <l>The ravisht hearer, could not but confesse,</l>
      <l>He might as well old <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens</hi> claime</l>
      <l>For birth, as <hi>Britaine,</hi> circled with the Maine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>'Tis true, we have these lauguages still left;</l>
      <l>But spoken, as apparrell got by theft</l>
      <l>Is worne: disguis'd, and shadowed. Had hee</l>
      <l>Liv'd but with us, till grave maturity;</l>
      <l>Though wee should ever in his change have lost,</l>
      <l>Wee might have gaind enough whereof to boast</l>
      <l>Our nations better Genius; But now</l>
      <l>Our hopes are nipt, e're they began to blow</l>
      <l>And sure I am, his losse must needs strike deep,</l>
      <l>For whom in verse, thus <hi>Englands Eye</hi> doth weepe.</l>
      <l>Whose teares thus dew'd upon his mournefull dust</l>
      <l>I will not longer trouble. They that must</l>
      <l>Carp though at best things; let them only read;</l>
      <l>These Poems here will strike that humour dead.</l>
      <l>Which I should praise too: but in them I see</l>
      <l>There is one blemish; for he hath nam'd mee.</l>
      <l>Else, I'le not think the Reader so distrest</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="11"/>In wit: but that he will admire the rest.</l>
      <l>Concluding thence, though in his forenoon-youth,</l>
      <l>(And what I now shall write is modest truth,)</l>
      <l>He knowes not him, who doth so much excell,</l>
      <l>That could so quickly, doe so much, so well.</l>
