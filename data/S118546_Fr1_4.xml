      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries amongst their many obiections against vs and our Religion, vse this
<pb facs="4"/> for one, that if wee refuse their Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their faith, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne to hell all our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. But it followeth not: for in such fundamental points as necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne saluation, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of merit, and meanes of Iustification, &amp;c. our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in former times were not of the Romish faith, but of our Religion: excluding, disclayming, &amp; renouncing all their owne merits, and cleauing only to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the merits of Iesus Christ for their saluation. This was the faith of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, &amp;c. Saint<note place="margin">Basillius in homel in Psal. 114.</note>
      <hi>Basil</hi> saith. Eternall rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
<pb facs="4"/> for them which haue fought a good fight in this world, yet not for the merit of their workes, but through the rich mercies of God, in whom they trust.</p>
   <p>Saint <hi>Hillary</hi> saith, our<note place="margin">Hillarius in Psal. 51.</note> workes suffice not to merit eternall life, but our hope is in the mercy of God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and euer.</p>
   <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Augustinus concione 1 in Psal. 70. Tua peccata sunt, merita Dei sunt: supplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tibi debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, et cum praemium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit sua dona coronabit non tua merita.</note> Sin is ours, Merit is Gods: Punishments are our due, but if rewardes come, God crownes his owne gifts, not our merites.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Gregory moral lib. 9. ca. 14.</note>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> (a Pope) saith, If I doe well, I shall haue eternall life, not by my merits but Gods mercy.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>And long after euen in<note place="margin">Bernardus sermone. 15. in Psal. 90.</note> the darkest times; deuote <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, A mans <hi>whole</hi> merit is to put the <hi>whole</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of his heart in him, that hath saued the <hi>whole</hi> man, and therfore in another place he concludes, <hi>My me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the mercy of the Lord.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>All these <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">Sermone 61. in Cant. meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum meum miseratio do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> deny, and himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth some of them or all, but shapes such answeres to them, as it would satisfye an indifferent man euen to read him in that pont.</p>
   <p>And this was not the faith<note place="margin">Bellar. to. 4. lib. 5. de lust. cap. 6.</note> of the principall Fathers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by the mercy of God, it was deriued euen vnto the inferiour, and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb facs="5"/> sort, not of the Cleargy alone, but euen of the Laity also.</p>
   <p>If the monuments of elder ages were extant &amp; vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, it is more thē maruailous how cleerly this truth would shine: that our forefathers were not damned, though they beleeued, not as doth the present <hi>Romish</hi> Church: Nay further that they were saued by the same faith by which wee are at this day, though they were misled by some errours, and nusled in some superstitions; for which (being sinnes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or rather of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) we hope the Lord was mercifull vnto them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="6"/> that euen <hi>Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe cried to God to <hi>clense</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note>
      <hi>him from his secret sinnes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But such hath beene the craft and malice of Popish policy, that partly the oldest bookes are embezilled and extinguished, and those that remaine are so altered cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraued from that they were, that there now remaines not one of many of the testimonies, which the former ages yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this truth.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the prouidence of God hath not failed his Church: for (do what they could) yet he who said <hi>the gates of hell</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note>
      <hi>should not preuaile against the
<pb facs="6"/> true faith,</hi> hath taken order in spight of all plots to the contrary, that so many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies shall be preserued, as shall sufficiently witnesse to the world that our faith flourished in former ages.</p>
   <p>My purpose is (if the Lord will) to gather vp such Antiquities though they be scattered and almost lost in these old worme eaten Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts wherein they lye buried, which as Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence hath deliuered from the force and fury of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors fire, so it is al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians duties to preserue them to posterity.</p>
   <p>I haue here begun with a <hi>Handfull,</hi> or rather a <hi>Hartfull</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> of holy prayers &amp; meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy to be worne in the <hi>hand,</hi> and borne in the <hi>heart</hi> of euery Christian, by which it may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the former ages, foure &amp; fiue hundred yeares ago, was euen the same by which we looke to bee saued at this day.</p>
   <p>Let this haue leaue (right Honorable) to come abroad out of the corners of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, into publicke view, in the light &amp; lustre of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned name, who are knowne to bee a reuerencer of Antiquity, a Mecaenas of learning, a practiser of piety, an enemy to the idolatry,
<pb facs="7"/> superstitions, ambitious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, traiterous deuices, and Machiauellian plots of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites: and a detester of such especially, who vnder a pretence of Religion, doe cloake and conuey impieties against God, and against his annointed.</p>
   <p>The God of heauen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that blessed worke of his in your Lordship more &amp; more, to the glory of his name, the benefite of this Realme, and to your owne saluation in Christ Iesus: So praieth</p>
