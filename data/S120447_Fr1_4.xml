   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou cāst not be ignorant <hi>(good Reader,)</hi> what speciall differē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue bene, (and yet are) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōgst our selues in som points, about the <hi>Iustification of a Sinner before GOD.</hi> Whence manie weake mindes haue bene some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perplexed, &amp; some strong ones (at least in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits) exceedingly distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as though there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs which ouer-turned Foundations, teaching blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Heresies about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whereas all of vs with one
<pb facs="6"/> mouth professe this, <hi>That a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is Iustified, not by any Formall inherent Righteousnes in himselfe, but onely by the free &amp; meere grace and mercie of GOD, through the meritorious Satisfaction of our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ƲIOVR CHRIST, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediatour betweene God and a Sinner.</hi> Wherein we all giue all the glory of our Iustification &amp; Saluation to God in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and therein hold the maine Foundation. We differ onely in certaine Circumstances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nothing is derogated, eyther from the mercie of God, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ, or arrogated to our owne workes.</p>
   <p>Some of vs hold, that a Sinner is iustified by the vertue &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites both of Christs actiue and passiue Obedience imputed. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome, by the merites of his passiue obedience imputed, but
<pb facs="6"/> not of his Actiue. A third sort, by the merits both of his actiue and passiue, but not imputed.</p>
   <p>The first, giues all to Christ, but equally diuides the vertue, betweene his actiue and passiue righteousnes. The second giues no lesse to him: only that which it takes from the actiue, it giues superabundantly to the passiue.</p>
   <p>The thirde, giues as much to Christ, as eyther of the other, derogating nothing from the vertue, eyther of the actiue or passiue, but denying only a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner of Application.</p>
   <p>The first of these opinions hath bin, &amp; (for ought I know) is most generally receiued, &amp; is that which seemes most <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall,</hi> &amp; which in this Treatise I desire to maintain. If in some fewe passages, I goe out of that beaten tracke, which they haue
<pb facs="7"/> kept, who before me haue main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained this truth, it is not from any affectation of singularitie; For I neuer held it safe, nor any credite to walke alone, in any matter of Religion, any further then meere necessitie, and iust <hi>Apologie</hi> requires: but because some partes of the way, which they goe, lyes ouer such hills, as I am not able to climbe, I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue ben forced somtimes to goe somewhat aside, that I might the better come againe into the way, where it lies in the plaine.</p>
   <p>For the other two opinions, (with due reuerence, reserued to the maintainers of them; whome I acknowledge to bee great learned and worthie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines) I thinke them somewhat erroneous; but withall, to haue risen from two positions (to my
<pb facs="7"/> seeming) as erroneous, held or granted by some (if not all) who haue maintained the first.</p>
   <p n="1">1 <hi>That Christ by the merites of his Passiue obedience onely, hath freed vs from the guilt of all sinne, both actuall and, originall, of Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Commission.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2 <hi>That in the imputation of Christs Obedience both Actiue and Passiue, God doeth so beholde and consider a Sinner in Christ, as if the Sinner himselfe had done &amp; suffered, those very Particulars which Christ did, and suffered for him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The first of these, is the very ground and Foundation of the second opinion: which beeing graunted, I cannot (as yet) s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e how it can be auoided, but that wee must holde the same. For what more can be required, to the Iustification of a sinner, thē to be freed, and expiated of all
<pb facs="8"/> sinnes whatsoeuer, not onely of Commission, but Omission?</p>
   <p>Can a man possibly bee more iustified, then so to be freed frō all sinne &amp; fault, as to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and iudged as one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer committed any euil forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; neuer omitted any good required? Doth Christs actiue Righteousnes according to the Lawe consist in any thing else, but in the leauing vndone of whatsoeuer euill forbidden, and in the doing of all good things commanded? What then auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the imputation of this, when so much is granted to be obtained by the other? If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee will firmely maintaine the first Opinion, I cannot see, but wee must needs forgoe this first Position, and holde</p>
   <p>
      <hi>That to the very Expiation of sinne, and the Freeing from the guilte
<pb facs="8"/> hereof, the imputattion both of the Actiue and Passiue righteousnes of Christ are necessarie, and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ne is not to bee separated from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>her.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The second Position taketh <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>mputation</hi> in such a strict sense <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s seemes not necessarie; For both the Actiue &amp; Passiue righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Christ, may be said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o bee imputed to a sinner, if God (without any further cōsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) but accept that which Christ hath done and suffred, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> ful satisfaction, for that which a sinner should haue done, or suffted in his owne person: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it seems to take away all necessity of the imputation of Christs Suffrings. For if God repute Christes fulfilling of the Lawe, to be euery sinners fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law, then in his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling thereof, is euery such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="9"/> (to whom it is in such a mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imputed) perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If perfectly righteous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Iustifiable, what needes then Christ moreouer, eyther to Suffer for the Iustification of a sinner, or a sinner to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Suffer in Christ, to any such ende?</p>
   <p>This other position, (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) hath giuen occasion of the third Opinion. The Author thereof, (a very Learned, Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and Iudicious Diuine) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all Imputation, both of the Actiue and Passiue righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ (as farre as I can learne,) onely in the strict sense aforesaide, and that (as it seemes to mee,) vppon good ground, as may appeare further somewhat in this Treatise.</p>
   <p>Our differences then (blessed be God,) are not so great, but
<pb facs="9"/> there is both possibilitie, and hope of Reconciliation, and no such cause of any fiery Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions one against an other; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, seeing that they who heerein are out of the way, may seeme to haue beene put out thereof, onely by the blockes, that our selues have layde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I take not vpon mee to bee a Moderator between so many Learned men of all sides, or to see further then they, into so great a Mysterie.</p>
   <p>If in some pety Circumstances I haue discouered that which they haue ouerseene, it is not so much for want of any sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sight in them, as for that they haue not stouped so lowe as I haue done: It beeing not strange for them that look high est, and see furthest, to ouer-see much; and not vnvsuall for
<pb facs="10"/> those who are standers by, (though simple in comparison) to see some things, which the cunningest Gamesters some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ouersee.</p>
   <p>I first penned this Treatise to teach my selfe, and haue herein opposed my self as much as any man else, as may wel be known to some, who knowe what I haue formerly helde.</p>
   <p>After, for my further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and information, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed diuers Copies thereof to be written forth, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to sundrie Reuerend and learned Diuines, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same to their censures; from whome I receiued (out of their loue) diuers materiall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimaduersions, and doubtes: which thogh they haue not bin of force to moue mee to change my mind in any material point,
<pb facs="10"/> yet haue made me explane mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
