   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maisters, the worthinesse of this worke commended by some of good indgement, and the friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which you gave the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot</hi> Prince <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> (when of French hee became English) hath caused this stranger and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bee recommended vnto mee by my friend, with a desire to have him brought acquainted with our English language and fashions. To satisfie his request, I have vndergone the paines, and you are now (if you please) to reape the pleasure. For having apparelled him (as you may see) in this English ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, I do now send him vnto you, trusting you will affoord him as friendly a welcome as you did to my French <hi>Epirot.</hi> It may be hee will prove worthie of your liking and good acceptance. For if I be not deceived, in conversing with him, you shall find both delight and profit: delight by the varietie of sundry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and variable Histories, which he will discover &amp; recount vnto you: profit in regard of his sound Arguments, &amp; profound knowledge in all kinds of learning and philosophie, accompanied with great reading and experience in the antiquities of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, both Iewes, Arabians, Greeks and other nations: besides many things in him of worthy observation. Amongst all which parts, if in some points you find him not so sound a Divine as
<pb facs="5"/>the excellencie of this worke would have required: You must beare with one defect: and consider, that being a Civilian by profession, his breeding, bringing vp, and practise, was in the Court and constitutions of Rome. From whence what can wee expect but Romish Divinitie. Herein therefore your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must supply the partialitie and particularitie of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And for other points in him, I will rather referre h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> to be commended by your owne censure and iudgement, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> seeke by any insinuation of mine, to worke him into your good affections. Wherefore recommending this Orphan stranger to that courtesie which gentle spirits do vsually yeeld vnto strangers, I leave him to his Fortune; and to you wish all contentment. So fare you well.</p>
