      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of a resolution, whether more bold or zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, I know not, I have adventured this second Booke of my <hi>Tragicall Histories</hi> to the World, under your Honours Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and protection: Neither neede I goe farre to yeeld either your Honour, or the World, a reason of this my <hi>Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> sith your Uertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling your Bloud, as much as your <hi>Nobility</hi> illustrates your Vertues, was the first motive which drew me hereunto: for whiles many others indeavour to bee great, your Honour (resembling your selfe) not onely indeavours, but strives to bee good; as well knowing that <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is the glory and essence, yea the life, and as I may say, the soule of <hi>Greatnesse;</hi> and that betwixt <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> there is this difference and disparitie▪ that, makes us famous, this, immortall; that, beloved of men, this, of <hi>God;</hi> that, accompanyeth us only to our Graves, and this, to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> My second prevayling Motive in this my <hi>Dedication</hi>
      <pb n="82" facs="57"/>
proceeded from the respect of my particular duety, (as my first was solely derived from the consideration of your owne generall and generous Uertues) for having the honour to retaine to your <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Brother, Sir <hi>Edward Sackvile</hi> Knight, to whom, for many singular respects, and (immerited) favours (whiles I am my selfe) Iowe not onely my service, but my selfe; I therein hold me obliged and bound to proffer and impart this part of my Labours to your Honour, as the first publike testimony of my zeale and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, eternally devoted and consecrated to the <hi>Illustrious</hi> Name and Family of the <hi>Sackeviles;</hi> whereof <hi>Gods</hi> Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath made your Honour chiefe Heire and Pillar. The drift and scope of these Histories are to informe the World how <hi>Gods Revenge still fights and triumphs against the crying and execrable sinne of (wilfull and premeditated) Murther,</hi> which in these our (impure and profane) times, is so fatally and frequently coincident to unregenerate <hi>Christians;</hi> which Scarlet and bloody Crime is infallibly met with, and rewarded by <hi>Gods</hi> sharpe and severe punishments; having purposely published and divulged them to my deare Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> that they may serve (though not by the way of comparison, yet of application) as the sight of <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> bloudy Robe (shewed by <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> when hee there pronounced his funerall <hi>Oration)</hi> thereby to make his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Murtherers in the greater horrour and execration with the people. The <hi>Histories</hi> of themselves are as different, as their effects and accidents: their Scenes being wilfully and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid in diuers parts of <hi>Christendome</hi> beyond the seas, and the Tragedies vnfortunately perpetrated and personated by those, who more adhering to impiety, then <hi>Grace,</hi> and to Satan, then <hi>God,</hi> made shipwracke, if not of their soules with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I am sure of their liues with their fortunes, and of their fortunes with their lives. They themselves (or rather their sinnes) first brought the Materials, I, onely the collection, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<pb n="83" facs="57"/>
and pollishing of these their deplorable <hi>Histories,</hi> which are penned in so low a sphaere of speech, and so inelegant a phrase, as they can no way merit the <hi>Honour</hi> of your perusall, much lesse of your iudgement, and least of all, of your Noble protection and Patronage.</p>
   <p>Howsoever, my hopes (led and marshalled by the premises) doe as it were flatter mee, that your perfections will winke at my imperfections, and your curiosity at my ignorance and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in daigning permit this my rude Pamphlet, to salute and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage the World, under the authenticall passe-port of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours favour; who of her selfe is composed of so poore metall (or rather drosse) as without the pure gold of your Honourable Name, it would runne a hazard, not to passe currant with the curious wits, and censures of this our (too curious and too censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) age; whereof could I rest assured, I should then not onely rejoyce, but triumph in this my happinesse, as so richly exceeding the proportion of my poore Labours and merits, that I could not aspire to a greater honour, nor desire a sweeter felicity: And so recommending this my imperfect Pamphlet to your favour, my unworthy selfe to your pardon, and your <hi>Honour,</hi> your <hi>Noble Countesse,</hi> and the sweet young <hi>Lady</hi> your <hi>Daughter,</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> best favours and mercies, I will assume the confidence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie to remaine</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your <hi>Honours</hi> in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and service.
