   <head>THE PROEME
TO HIS
GENIVS
ON THE SACRED
PARTHENES
herself.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y GENIVS; If thou needs must
praise, extol, and magnify Beautie,
Vertue, Honour; and not in the
ayre only of <hi>Ideas,</hi> or abstract
from sense, but in a subiect real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
subsisting: I say, if thou needs must dignify
and eternize a pure creature aboue the skyes,
praise then such an one, whose superlatiue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
when thou hast sayd the most, can hardly
so exceed, but that her due <hi>Elogies, Encomiums,</hi> and
<hi>Panegyricks,</hi> stil shal farre transcend the facultie
of thy tongue, and thou be acquit of the least
imputation of flatteries. And if my <hi>Genius</hi> carrie
thee (my pen) into daliances, as it were, to
deliciat with thy self, vpon thy plumes, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of that noble Sex, corriual with the
<pb facs="6"/>
Masculin; doe not, I prythee, with <hi>Isocrates,</hi>
seeke a <hi>Helena,</hi> that fatal and most deplorable
fire-brand of the <hi>Troyan</hi> Cittie, on whom that
elegant and terse Sophister powred forth the
musks and ciuets of his venal tongue, the riches of
of a wanton and luxuriating wit. Behold SHE
is euen now at hand, whom worthily thou
mayst, and whom thou canst not prayse enough,
so farre from praysing her too much; who besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
is able wel to guerdon and recompence thy
prayses giuen her, with heaped and redoubled
interest. Behold then our SACRED PARTHENES,
Virgin of Virgins, for excellencie, is SHE, whom
safely thou mayst prayse, whom the impatient
World for so manie Ages, groaning vnder their
pressing burden of their crimes, with vowes and
prayers had most incessantly begged and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned.
A boon of wel-nigh fiftie Ages suit, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at last with much adoe. So great a work it
was for Nature, albeit holpen by Grace, to
bring forth to Mortals a creature, worthie to
be the Mother of God, Ladie of the World,
and the true Reparatresse of life. Nor doe
thou frame to thyself heer the <hi>Mercuries</hi> of a
counterfet and Sophisticat candour, couloured
cheekes, curled hayre, and wreathed knots with
inexplicable <hi>Meanders.</hi> Seeke not Vermilion or
Ceruse in the face, bracelets of Oriental-pearles on
her wrist, Rubie-carknets on the neck, rich pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
in the eares, and a delicious fan of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
<pb facs="7"/>
feathers in her hand, nor al that magasin of
Feminin riches, or richest ornaments of Beautie,
enough to belye beauties rather, and destroy
them quite, then to afford them, where they are
not found; they being nothing els then a precious
Scene of fopperies, which they only seeke with a
curious wastfulnes, who wil needs be wholy mad
with the greatest sumptuousnes and cost; wheras
surely true Beautie is but one, which euen inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
of the mind makes, being the liuelie coulour
of God; and was no doubt that, which so much
graced our PARTHENES, and set her forth, whom
the entire and intemerate comlines of Vertues
hath crowned with such a gloriet on her head,
and such splendour and glorie in heauen, as in a
pure creature nothing may be imagined more
magnificent in riches, nor in suauities sweeter.
And surely when I think more attētiuely of her, it
seemes to me, the highest Architect of All and
great GOD, the sole Moderatour of all, in creating
this one Soule, hath so admirably exprest himself
in her, and with his most exquisit fingars, hath
bestowed so much art and industrie in her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation,
and so pleased himself with the delicat
draughts he hath shewed in this one image of
himself, as if in the shop of human things he
would expose her to all, to be imitated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when as that Soule, farre purer then the
Starres, and flowing with so manie exquisit
ornaments, glided into the Tabernacle of her
<pb facs="7"/>
bodie, that impure Firebrand was not cast into
her, which first was kindled in the Authours of
our kind, and flamed forth afterwards farre and
wide, to the waste and vtter ruine of the whole
world, but as a Saphyr or purer Adamant, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and growes vp in pure and burnisht gold: so
a most chast Soule, by the hands of God dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
so therof, was put into her inuiolable
and sanctified bodie, that no least stayne of her
stock and progenie might light vpon her. Then,
after. SHE (that golden issue of her Mother)
was borne and brought forth to light, I easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that Nature recreated and refreshed from
the daylie miserie it lay in, euen laughed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her, supposing the light was newly risen to
her, when first she fixt her eyes on her, from
whose precious and Virginal womb, was the
Fountain of light itself to spring. The Virgin-infant
heervpon was nursed-vp and trayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen
chast walls, in a most holie discipline of
Patrial lawes, and instructed with those studies
of arts, that might addresse her as a noble
Sacrarie of God. Anticipating vertue, she
vrged and pressed more hard the flower paces
of her years, which hardly could endure the
long demurres of age, of vhom was Nature
ashamed as it were to impose anie lawes of
longer attendance. For euen now in her first
age, there shined manie <hi>Dotes</hi> in her, as starres
in the heauens in a serene night, like sparkling
<pb facs="8"/>
gemmes fixed in their orbs; since SHE had in her
whole life, as you know, a maruelous societie of al
Vertues, wherewith SHE woue that loome of
her age, as with singular and most excellent
figures, in whom the absolute consent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of al Vertues haue magnificently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
that Beautie should not violate Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes;
grauitie, infringe lowlines; meekenes,
grauitie; Simplicitie, Maiestie; facilitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie;
lastly (which til then was neuer heard
of) that the name of <hi>Mother</hi> should be nothing
iniurious to <hi>Virginitie.</hi> Al Vertues stroue alike in
HER, and al had the victorie. Nor yet was SHE de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture
of the guifts of Nature likewise, while a
certain Diuinitie of beautie dazeled the aspects
of men.<note place="margin">So Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius very nigh des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes her,</note> The bashful forhead (seate of sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes)
soft and gently arose; beneath the
black and archie browes, shined forth the bright
lamps of HER eyes, which how powerfully they
pierced and penetrated the heauens, who
knowes not? The nose most gracefully inflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
made a handsome kind of pillaster to her
forhead; lips somewhat thinner, the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of a meeke elocution, and celestial gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
a great affabilitie of speach; a singular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
of gate; a countenance, graceful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
softnes or leuitie, graue without statelines,
set alwayes in a perpetual sereanes, which
hardly could admit the least impression of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It were long to prosecute the rest; I shal
<pb facs="8"/>
haue sayd al things, saying, SHE is the MOTHER
of GOD. But this dignitie when al the tongues,
I say not of men only, but euen of the Angels
themselues, shal proclaime and set forth, doe
what they can, shal be enforted to cry out:
<hi>De dilecta nunquam satis.</hi>
