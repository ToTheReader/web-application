      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a iust taxation of our times by graue and reuerend <hi>Beza, Dum tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra superiora cum nostris comparo, dicere consueui plus illos conscientiae scientiae minus habuisse; nos contrà scientiae plus, conscientiae minus habere:</hi> The braines of men were neuer more stuffed, their tongues neuer more stirring, and yet their hearts neuer more emptie, their hands neuer more idle. The disease of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers was ignorance, ours is impiety; they were ill in the head, we are sicke at the heart: they were blinde but (after their manner) deuout, wee are skilfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. No age was euer blessed with such a light of knowledge, and yet none more fruitfull of the workes of darknesse. The maine reason vndoubtedly why wisedome and holinesse, learning and sanctitie are so vsually now a daies diuorced, is because (as that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of old could complaine) <hi>disputare malumus quàm viuere:</hi> If men can argue and discourse of religion it suffices, not one of a thousand thoroughly digests his knowledge, or turnes the holy Precepts of Diuinitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practise. Hence, the world abounds with <hi>Polemicall</hi> bookes, which doe not so much compose as breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; (though I confesse the fault is not ours, but our Aduersaries, whose peruersnes will not be conuicted euen when they are conuicted:) But for <hi>practicall</hi> diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and liuely deuotion, it is an argument not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary then rare, handled but by few and not by many regarded. Yet in this iniquity of times, wherein the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men had more need to be ordered then their iudgements informed: in my opinion, those Treatises
<pb facs="5"/> are of best seruice and vse which reduce Christianity into action, and warme the heart and conscience with deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this ranke I account this <hi>Commentary:</hi> which was a principall motiue vnto mee (as we all owe our selues vnto the common good) not to smother a worke so seruiceable for this age, nor to bereaue Gods Church of such a furtherance; especially being herein encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by sundry reuerend and iudicious.</p>
   <p>A <hi>Commentarie</hi> perhaps not to the taste of many men in this age, whose nice palate doth loath the dry <hi>manna,</hi> and can best rellish the vnsauory sauces of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (who cannot fancie Diuinity vnlesse she be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly trim'd vp in the light colours of humane art and eloquence) will here require elegancie of words, and quarrell at his carelesse stile. I answer, <hi>mores non verba composuit, &amp; animis dixit non auribus,</hi> the scope of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors was his auditors instruction not his own applause, nor did he care to please so much as to profit. To come with the <hi>inticing words of mans wisedome,</hi> and to <hi>preach</hi> only <hi>themselues</hi> is the note of false Teachers: the charge of Christs Minister is <hi>in demonstration of the spirit and of power to diuide the word of truth aright</hi> vnto his people, and this was our Authors aime. Gods oracles are to be faithfully expounded, not curiously minced, not loosly dallied with, &amp; surely the plaine song of <hi>Scripture</hi> is the best musicke without these quauering descants of mans wit. How licentiously &amp; prophanely <hi>Popish Friers</hi> haue abused Gods holy word by their trifling <hi>Postills,</hi> it is too manifest. Yea (be it spoken with due modesty and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to those <hi>Worthies,</hi> to whose industry and wit the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is so much beholding,) some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Doctors</hi> were too far in loue with quaint interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: especially <hi>Origen,</hi> whose excessiue allegorizing
<pb facs="5"/> (by the confession of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> who yet was his great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite &amp; partiall in his praises) caused the <hi>Apostate Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius</hi> to blaspheme and to scoffe at the Scriptures. Which consideration, no doubt, moued <hi>Caluin, Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon, Martyr,</hi> and the rest of our late and learned Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to sticke so close to the letter of the Text, and in all simplicitie to deliuer the meaning of the Holy Ghost. Their iudgement our Author approued, and followed their example, opening in these <hi>Lectures</hi> the simple and most naturally intended sense of the holy Apostle, and and thence vrging &amp; applying the Obseruations so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, that many (not only of his ordinarie hearers, but euen of the <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> by whom he was much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) blessed God for the direction and comfort they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from his mouth. The life of deliuery in him was very powerfull, &amp; made great impression in his hearers: this booke wants that aduātage, which yet is here suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because those things which then were only deliuered in the eares of few, are here submitted to the eyes of all.</p>
   <p>Touching the <hi>Author</hi> himselfe I need not say much. Altho (after a sort) he condemned himselfe to obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and affected a priuate and retired life: yet he could not hide himselfe from the eyes of the world, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally noted and esteemed for his holines, his integrity, his learning and grauity, his indefatigable paines in the discharge of his ministeriall function, his singular wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and dexteritie in the gouernment of our <hi>Colledge,</hi> which by Gods blessing vpon his care hath sent forth many learned Ministers into the Church, many worthy Gentlemen into the Common-wealth. Briefely, in his whole conuersation he was so sincere &amp; vnrebukeable, that by some (partly by occasion of these <hi>Lectures</hi>) he was defamed for precisenes. Indeede, as the times are

      <pb facs="7"/> now, the only meanes almost to auoid that reproch is to be notoriously wicked. But (in few words to wipe of that imputation) how much he condemned the iniurious zeale of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> how far he misliked all busie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers of the Churches peace &amp; quiet, still grauely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to calmnesse and moderation, how heartily he reuerenced his holy mother the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and how willingly he conformed himselfe to her seemely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and iniunctions, besides his practise, he hath so many reuerend &amp; graue witnesses, as he had familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. To say truth, he was not of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper, nor yet <hi>pure in his owne eyes:</hi> zealous &amp; feruent, not turbulent &amp; contentious: a faithfull seruant of God, an humble and obedient sonne of the Church, an enemy to faction no lesse then to superstition. Lastly, when the few and euill daies of his pilgrimage were ended, (as a comfortable death euer followes a conscionable life,) he patiently &amp; meekly endured Gods gentle visitation, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly longed after his dissolution, and to be with Christ, which he knew was best of all, and at length (when the <hi>time</hi> of his <hi>changing</hi> was come) deuoutly cōmending his soule to the mercy of his redeemer, he closed vp his eyes in peace, &amp; was caried to his graue with honor. He now rests from his labors and his works follow him: he hath left behind him a <hi>blessed memory,</hi> and <hi>a name sweeter then any oyntment.</hi> This holy monument of his industry I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thy vse and serious meditation, good <hi>Christian Reader:</hi> which fauourably accepted may incourage me to publish other of his labours. The <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> blesse all our indeuours to the building vp of his Church, and our owne euerlasting saluation, <hi>Amen.</hi>
