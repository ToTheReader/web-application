   <head>❧ TO THE GODLY and Christian Reader, perfect health of soule and bodie from our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, the only giuer and preseruer of them both.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese few Sermons, which at the first were meant but vnto a few, I haue now published and made common vnto others: not onely that by this meanes the doctrine and consolation contained in them, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vnto the first hearers (which for them <hi>is a sure thing,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1.</note> as the Apostle speaketh;) but that according to the Communion of Saints, as in the naturall bodie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
      </note> that gift which is in any part, the rest haue the vse of it; so in the mysticall bodie of Christ, that which he by his spirit, and by his owne ordinance had made proper vnto some, others might haue the fruit and benefit of the
<pb facs="5"/> same. For seeing we be all alike subiect vnto the same corruption and vnbeliefe in our soules, and there is no temptation appertaining vnto man, but euery one may fall into it, as well as another: there is no instruction or comfort out of the word of God, which any haue receiued, but the rest of the seruants of God may receiue the like from thence: especially seeing they proceede from one and the same spirit of truth and of life, which quickening the whole bodie, worketh in euery member proportionably. Therefore as I am not altogether out of hope, that others may bee benefited by them, besides those for whom they were first prepared: so if they be, J shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me of this double labour; the one in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of them, and the other in publishing of them. I haue intituled them, <hi>Medicines for the Plague,</hi> because they containe many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations fit for that euill, both to preuent it, and to beare it patiently, and to be recouered out of it, and to die comfortably in it. And I must needs confesse, that I did not make choice of this text, to intreat of that argument of purpose, for then I might haue taken many other more fit in the Scripture; and this (to say the truth) doth not properly concerne it one whit: but hauing entred
<pb facs="6"/> into this Psalme, before there was any great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Plague, vpon this occasion of the Kings Highnesse his first comming into these parts of his dominion, and so in the beginning handling something of our dutie vnto our soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne prince, according to the generall drift of the text; when this new accident of the Plague fell out, because the Psalme did still so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the time, as it was a time of trouble, I held on my course, and made a vertue of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and so did applie the Scripture vnto the time, and all meditations of trouble arising out of it vnto this one kind of trouble of the Plague especially, proper vnto that time, so far as it was necessarie. And so during the time of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fasts, commaunded by publicke authoritie, and generally vsed for the most part euery where, continuing in this text, as the Plague encreased, so in my whole course I did still aime at that more and more. Whereupon it commeth to passe, that the <hi>Medicines for the Plague</hi> (so called) are inserted somewhat after the beginning, and so more towards the middest, and in the end most of all, according to the time. Therefore though this one thing be not dispersed through the whole booke, and in euery Sermon, (though it be in the
<pb facs="6"/> most) the whole booke not vnfitly hath his deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof: euen as some compound medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are called not of all, but of one principall ingredient, and that also which in the artificiall confection is added to the rest in the middest, or rather sometimes euen at the last. And as the same Apothecaries, though they haue more of that stuffe remaining, put to no more than is fit at that time for the present receit: so though there was more of this Psalme remaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled, yet I left it off, when the Lord in so great mercie did put an end almost to the Plague, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the chiefe parts of this realme; at what time also all men did discontinue their weekely fasting. And though I meant nothing lesse at the first preaching of them, than that they should thus be divulged; yet seeing the Lord did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put it into my mind (as I am persuaded) and gaue me good successe by his blessing in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe in writing, J doe not repent me of this labour. And it shall not be vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs all by this meanes so long after, both to remember in what case we were then, to be still humbled by it; and what we then prayed for, that now wee may be thankefull; and what wee then vowed, that now we may performe it: and that
<pb facs="7"/> we may be prepared for the like againe. And thus hoping of your Christian patience and charitable iudgement of these my indeuors, and of my good meaning in them, I commend them to your godly consideration, with my prayers for you, and for them, vnto him, who onely giueth encrease to the planting and watering of all men according to his heauenly wisdome;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> and desire you also, that you would further me with your prayers this way, and euery way, that so we may all of vs receiue as much as we giue, according to the promise of our Sauiour Christ,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38.</note>
      <hi>Looke vvith vvhat mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you mete vnto others, vvith the same it shall be mete vnto you againe.</hi> In hope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I rest, and bid you heartely farewell in the Lord. </p>
