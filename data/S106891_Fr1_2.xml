   <head>The Authour to his friend.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emembring the promes that I made vnto you when we did embarque or take shipping in this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for to accōplishe the viage of <hi>Florida,</hi> that, at my returne, if that the Lord God did permit me to returne, I would bring you newes from thence. And althoughe that since my returne, I haue often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes deuised with you: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I thought good to doe a thing more agreable vnto you, to set forth in writing so much as I coulde well remember, and that for two reasons. One is, for that I knowe that you loue to heare published the greate wonders of God, which hath bene founde greate in thys discourse, when that shall be sene, the great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that he hath deliuered vs oute off, and hath of his mercy graunted vs to sée our owne natiue Countrey. The other
<pb facs="3"/>is, for that you shall gladlye heare tryed, the inconstancie and variable estate of humaine kinde, wherein his hye looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abated, he learneth to call to God, as it appertayneth to magnifie hys high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to walke vprightly in his obedience and seruice. You shall vnderstand (friend) to what end I speake this. The erperiēce sheweth, that it is a daungerous thing, when that not contented with our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are drawen backe from our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, we do that that God defendeth, yea, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which is nothing necessary. For what nedeth the handy crafts man to leaue his shop, the housholder his deare wyfe, his swéete children, his countrey, his owne &amp; proper goods, for to go seke false &amp; straūge thinges, seking to take shadowes, being guided by blinde guides. But euery one will touch felicity, the which can not be without the meanes of externe goods, yea euē so as is desputed in the schole of that great Philosopher <hi>Aristotle.</hi> I confesse it on condition, if you will graunte that that is verye little, wherewith nature is contented, and that reason demaundeth,
<pb facs="3"/>but the couetousnesse is greate &amp; gapeth continually. Nowe we poore men at the least, ought to thinke on that which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> sayth.</p>
   <q>
      <l>That not onely he that possesseth much is happy,</l>
      <l>But he that the giftes of God can vse wysely,</l>
      <l>He whom pouertie holdeth let him paciently beare,</l>
      <l>He that seareth death is neuer the neare.</l>
      <l>He that is cōtēt &amp; prayseth fortunes state,</l>
      <l>Let him not shrinke at all, though she hir wings do beate</l>
      <l>He that seketh not to clime vp fortunes wheele,</l>
      <l>But is content with his estate, muche good thereby shall feele.</l>
   </q>
   <p>O how often is it come to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, during this perilious voyage, of that that I haue learned of <hi>Plinie,</hi> of one <hi>Gyges,</hi> that was the rychest of his tyme, how that he, being before the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> for to enquire of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most happiest of men. The miscrable proud man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood otherwise than the Oracle gaue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it was a poore olde man named <hi>Aglaus,</hi> which remayned in a corner of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> labouring and tilling a verye little ground which he had, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it rendred ynough to sustaine
<pb facs="4"/>his lyfe and his family, and being cōtent with this kinde of lyfe, couetousnesse and desire of gaine coulde not once moue him to go out of his little Village: so that he hauing this benefite, was an occasion to auoyde many euilles, and to receyue the lesse sorrowe and bitternesse during his life, louing better his presente estate, than to desire otherwise, and more estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his condition than the estate of Kynges. As for mée I am nowe bent to this opinion, that you ought well to note, that the harme that maye chaunce in a mans house during his absence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his wyfe and family, doth surpasse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pleasure of triumph, which victory doth promisse. For what profited it to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king of kings (for so <hi>Homer</hi> calleth him) to haue in ten yeares conquered &amp; gottē the moste richest Region of his time, when that at his retourne, he founde his house chaunged and altered, the hearte of his wife rauished by the conceptions of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oultery (beholde the fruite of his voyage) he loseth his lyfe, his sonne banished, and retourning from his banishment, killeth
<pb facs="4"/>his mother, and the wicked fornicatour that kepte hir, it had bene better for him then, that went to vnpeople <hi>Troy,</hi> and to take by force <hi>Yllion,</hi> to haue taried at home with his wife <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> thā to haue let a wicked man in his absence oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie his roume, and entise his wife to euill. Likewise of <hi>Helena,</hi> which bicause of hir husbands absēce, was rauished by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> amorous <hi>Paris:</hi> of <hi>Penelope</hi> which was required of so hote burning louers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that the prudente and wise warriour <hi>Vlysses,</hi> trauayleth the seas to finde out his country. It is therefore our partes, that haue bent our cares to Iesus Christ Lord of our soules, &amp; who alone ought to raigne in our consciences, to obey to his commaundementes, the which is, that a man should cleaue to his wife, and be to hir as glewe, for so haue I vnderstoode of our Doctours, that the worde doth sound <hi>Cula</hi> in the Hebrewe tongue. Morcouer, God cōmaundeth that the husband shuld render to his wife vnfayned loue &amp; good will, but what is the remedie when that they are seperated. I knowe that instlye,
<pb facs="5"/>we haue felt y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rygor of Gods iudgemēts: yea for many causes, and principally, for leauing our families, the which we ought to care for most of all, next to God. Let them go to <hi>Florida</hi> who list, for my parte I would not wishe, that that man, that is a houshoulder, should so leaue his occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for to séeke his aduēture in a straūge countrey, &amp; for a greater profite of gaine: what faire promysse so euer is made of his enterprise. Also, we haue borne the wrath and anger of God, as ye may sée in this discourse of <hi>Florida,</hi> which I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto you, desiring you to receyue it as a token or pledge of my good will and loue, the whiche this fiftene yeares hath helde our heartes, straightly lyncked and ioyned together by Iesus Christ our Lorde, to whom alone appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the rule, power &amp; glory, for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
