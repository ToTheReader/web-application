   <p>it myght in me so basse and simple a persone, appeare no small presumpcion to write vnto your Emperiall Maiestie, were not the cause of our publique gratulacions so iust and so greate, that no manne, what euer he bee, hauyng occasion to wryte, maye thynke hymselfe voyde of cryme; if he shoulde omytte to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and testifie the vnestimable comforte and ioye, whiche your vniuersall moste louyng and obedient subiectes, daily more and more doe take of your Maiesties singuler good procedinges and most excellent toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For where, by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> space of many yeres vntil it pleased the goodnesse of God to sende you vnto vs, the earneste prayers of all Englande was that we might haue a Prynce: and after the tyme of your natiuitie, whan God had so gracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously heard our peticions, we eftsons prayed that ye myght haue grace to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the godly steppes and proceadynges of your moste noble father: euerye man seeth nowe in your Maiestee suche towardenes of vertue and godly zele, that we haue conceyued no lesse then an vndoubted hope y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ye wyll (by Goddes gouernaunce) ferre passe your saied father, to whom our daily wysshinges and prayers thought it enough to haue you eguall.

If Royalmes (after the saiyng of Plato) are than and neuer els in blissed state, whan eyther Philosophiers, that is to saye, suche as knowe and loue God, doe reigne ouer thesame, or els the Kynges geue themselues to philosophie, that is to saye, to the due knowledge of God, to the disciplyne of vertue, and to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryght execucion of their office towardes all people: howe happye are we En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen of suche a Kyng, in whose chyldehood appereth as perfeict grace, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, godly zele, desire of literature, grauitie, prudence, iustice, &amp; magnaniraitie, as hath heretofore been found in Kinges of most mature age, of ful discrecion, of auncient reigne, and of passing high estimacion?

Al which prayses &amp; magnifying though they bee in dede muche inferiour to your moste woorthye desertes hytherto, yet your maiestie muste take and repute, not as a matter of insolencie by your moste louyng and faithful subiectes ministred vnto you, but rather as a thyng wrought in them by the instincte of god, to admonishe you of the Regal estate that he hath called you vnto: not as a prouocaciō of wordelye gloriyng in your self, but as an instrumente of admonicion to continue you in remembraunce of thankes geuing, and of discharging youre office: not as the baites of flatery meaning to fede your Maiestie in any conceipte of pryde, but rather as a glasse wherein to beholde your self what ye are, and how ye ought to continue: not as the pleasaunt ticleing or clawyng of adulacion but rather as a caucion that ye dooe nothing in all your life whereby ye maye bee founde or thought vnwoorthie the laude that is geuē you: and finally, not as a nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of any humam vanitie, but rather as a spur of exhortacion, not onely to beware <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

In the meane tyme Kyng Henry as a moste vigilaunt pastour ceaseth not with perpetuall trauayll to procure for the commodities and wealth of Englande, he ceaseth not by moste politique and moste holsome lawes to prouide for the establishyng of Englande in peace and tranquilitie. And because by the diligent readyng and meditacion yf holy Scriptures, he founde and obserued the true blissynges of God, and the fountayne of al grace and prosperitie to procede of the knowleage of God, and the due obseruacion of his lawes, lyke a moste christian Prince and a true defendour of the fayth, he conuerted and emploied al his studie and cogitacions to the redresse of such abuses in relygion, as by the moste corupte doctrine of the Romishe papacye had by degrees crepte into Christes churche, and preuailyng throughe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of yeres, were nowe so confirmed and established throughout all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christendome, that the Romishe Nabugodonozor held vs in forer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieccion, then euer was Israell holden in the captiuitie of olde Babilon, and so should we haue stil continued, had it not pleased almightie God of his botom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse mercie, to reise vp a Christian Cyrus your moste puissaunt father, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store vs agayne to our freedome in Christes bloud. For the Romishe Nabugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozor had by wrestyng and peruertyng the holy scriptures of God to the establyshing and maintenaunce of his vsurped supremitie clymed so high: that he was not nowe content to sitte in the chaire of Moses, but had moste blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously exalted hymselfe aboue all that is called God, that is to say, had made Goddes woorde frustrate, that his moste corrupte and moste pestilente doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine myght take place. He had by his deiulishe inuencions caste such a foggie miste of ignoraunce ouer Goddes moste holy Bible, he had with his Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall interpretacions in suche wyse polluted the sinceritie of Christes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, he had so infeeted the clere fountayne of Goddes woorde with the suddes of humayne tradicions, and the dregges of vayn ceremonies, he had by meane of papisticall troumperie so peruerted the vnderstanding of holy scriptures, he had so defaced the puritie of the faith with the beggerly patched cloke of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious weorkes not commaunded by Goddes lawe, he had so perplexed the grace of the ghospell with the false feigned merites and weorkes of superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion, he had so mangled the Christian profession with mo then an hundred soondry sectes of counterfaicte cloystreers of Antichristes owne generacion, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing like idle loitreers and vera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

no more power of the worlde whan Christe came downe to yearth for to redeme mankynde, then religion was nowe broughte oute of frame by the tyrannye of the Romyshe Babilon, nor God and hys soonne Iesus Christe any where lesse founde, than whan he was moste buisily named and spoken of in pulpites. Beeyng vnder the title and name of Christe, the moste eagre aduersarye of Christe and his ghospell, he ioyned hymselfe to the Philistines, and beyng their Goliah more nere sixtene then sixe cubites high, neither feared▪ ne shamed to shewe hymselfe in playne battayl of defiaunce, ne spared to open hys blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouthe, ne to drawe hys tyrannous sweorde, ne to shake his huige murderyng speare, agaynst the true Israelites of Christes litle selie flocke, and moste presumpteously to braggue agaynst all that euer woulde professe the syncere and vpryght doctrine of Gods woorde, tyll it pleased God to reyse vp vnto vs an Englishe Dauyd your moste noble father, who without anye ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure or weapon of yron and stele, without any harnesse of mannes makyng, without displeighing any banners in araye of humaine battaile, shoulde out of the slyng of his Regall auctoritie, cast the corner stone of Goddes woorde, whiche lyghtyng vpon the forhead of the sayd Goliah, felled his papacie stone dead, &amp; crushed it to poudre, neuer to be hable any more to noye or to face Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe Israel. Our sayd Dauid kyng Henry the eyght had learned by the boke of Deuteronomie (in whiche booke the feithfull seruaūt of God Moyses char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that whomsoeuer Israel shoulde make Kyng ouer them, thesame from the tyme that he wer sette in his Regall throne, should all the dayes of his lyfe haue continuall meditacion, and should styll reade therin, to the entente he myght learne to feare the Lorde his God, for to kepe all the woordes of hys lawe, and his ordinaunces for to dooe theim, and that he should not turne from the commaundementes eyther to the ryght hand or to the left, that bothe he and his children myght prolong their dayes in his Kyngdome:) he hadde (I saie) learned in the same booke, on the one syde the blessynges of god promysed to all suche prynces as on theyr owne parties woulde for the loue and feare of god walke vpryghtly in the execucion of the sayde commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and woulde partly by theyr good exaumple prouoke theyr subiectes to dooe the same, and partly by due execucion of iustice make them ashamed and also afeard to swerue or declyne from the lorde their god: and on the other syde the terrible malediccions and plagues of gods wrathe, threatned to all suche as neglected the vpryght obseruyng of all his preceptes and wayes. He loued the goodnesse of God, and feared his stroke, he sawe religion to bee ferre out of frame, he sawe some parte of his moste earnest trauailes and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to sette Englande in moste quiet and blissefull state, to fayl of condigne effecte through defaulte of reformacion in matters of religion. He saw &amp; found by experience of his owne manyfolde moste princely enterpryses, the onely cause why Christian Royalmes are plagued wyth warres, derthes, famyns, pestilences, &amp; other mortall extremyties, to come of Gods indignacion, because the worlde was so ferre gone astraigh from Christe, that nothyng was nowe weaxed so odious or detestable as his holy woorde, nothyng reputed so blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, as Christes holy ghospell, nothyng so lyght estemed as Christes blood and passion. He sawe the onely waye to Goddes fauour to bee the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracyng of his holy Scriptures, the drounyng wherof had enforced God to power his indignacion vpon the Christian worlde. He sawe and well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
<pb n="iiii" facs="4"/>
that God of his mercie was wylling to ceasse his wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce, if the Christian people woulde returne to hym. He perceyued God to offre his grace vnto the worlde by openyng their iyes, if leauyng theyr errour and ignoraunce thei woulde enbrace the clere lyght of the ghospell. He sawe moreouer that his moste louyng subiectes of Englande, (whome his godly exaumple had prouoked to tendre and seke the glorye of God) dyd nowe houngre and thirste the righteousnesse of God, and the knowleage of his woorde. He playnly sawe that no waye there was to a reformacion, but by this onely meane, yf the autoritie and vsurped supremitie of the See of Rome wer extirped, abolished, and clene extincte. For he sawe his countreimen the Englishe Israelites to bee holden in suche extreme bondage wythin the Romishe Egypte, that there was no hope of deliueraunce, but by the onely power and myghtifull arme of God reysyng vp some Moses that woulde in the face of that same moste cruell Pharao require that Israell myght bee freely leat goe. The huige seuenfold headed draguon was to the simple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour people, suche an obstacle, that they myght not come to Christe, and to all Christen princes suche a terrour, that they durste not. This draguon besydes the monstreous hissing of his curses and excommunicacions, and besides the contagious infeccion of idolatry and superstition, wherewith he had by his whelpes the cancarde papistes so adblasted the worlde, that he had enwrapped and drowned all Christendome in blindnesse and errour: he hadde also a mortall styng in his taill, wherewyth he ceassed not by all kyndes of deathes and tormentes, to destruye and mourdre as manye as woulde once open theyr lyppes agaynste his moste detestable and moste blasphemous abominacions. This draguon ceassed not continually to persecute the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clothed in the sunne, that is to saye, Christes dere spouse the churche of England, but as a rampyng and roryng lyon, he stoode euer ready watchyng that he mighte deuoure her chyldren the Christian flocke, whiche she nowe groned to bryng foorth to Christe, had not the Englishe Michael kyng Henry the eight taken in hande to fight agaynst the sayde draguon, and been streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened of God wyth hys Aungelles the lordes, and godlye prelates, to caste the sayde draguon that olde serpente and his Aungels oute of Englande. This was the great harlotte that sitteth vpon manye waters, wyth whome the kynges of the yearthe haue committed fornicacion, and the inhabiters of the yearthe been made drounken wyth the wyne of her fornicacion: the woman sittyng vpon the rosecouloured and tenhorned beaste full of names of blasphemye, she sitting araied in purple and rosecolour, and decked with golde, precious stones, perles, and in her hande a cuppe of golde full of abhominacions and filthines of her fornicacion, and in her forehead a name of great misterie written, <hi>great Babylon the mother of whoredome and abhominacions of the yearth</hi>: and the same whore drounken with the bloude of Saynctes, and with the bloude of wytnesses of Iesus. Thys was the huyge monstre Hydra, (to whome the poetes attribute seuen heades, some eyghte, and some an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred heades) whome aswell king Iohn of Englande, as also soondrie other Cstristen princes had attempted to vanquishe, but as soone as they had cutte of one heade, three other heades grewe vp for it, so that euerye wounde that was geuen him was a more confirmacion and encrease of his strength, vntyll our Hercules Kyng Henrye the eyghte perceyuyng that no power, no

Long time endured this conflycte betwene our Englyshe Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and the Romishe Hydra ere he could bee destruied, so fast grewe vp a more numbre of serpentine heades, whan any one was cut of. For besydes the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde moste monstruous heades, of Idolatrye, Pylgremages, supersticions, countrefaicte religions, and innumerable abuses mo, whiche kyng Henry had to cutte of, his whelpes the indurate generacion of papistes deuised all meanes possible to kepe hys auctoritie styll in Englande, ne lefte any engin vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to staigh and lette the abolishyng of hys vsurped power, abusyng the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people wyth all kyndes of delusion and iuggleyng of countrefaicte myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of feigned visions, of liyng in traunces, of rapcions euen vnto the thyrde heauen, of sophistycall learning, of holy contestacions, of subtily inuented pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, of bolde comminacions and threateninges, of voices auouched to haue come from heauen, of peruertyng the sence of scripture to mainteine his power, of wrytyng bookes in derogacyon of the kynges procedynges.</p>
   <p>And to the ende there shoulde not lacke any kinde of wickedenesse that the saied Hydra and his adherentes, moonkes, fryers., and other cloystreers were hable to weorke, he founde meanes besydes many other stormes of forrayne warres and conspiracies, so ferre to abuse the credulitie of the simple ignoraunte peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he brought theim halfe in a detestacion and hatered of Gods woorde, and seduced theim to aduenture with a lytle blaste of sedicion, to distourbe the cogitacions of suche a noble and a good kyng, beeyng than moste ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For as soone as she had in moste lawful matrymonye brought foorth your grace, she departed this worlde: as thoughe she should haue saied: I haue dooen the offyce y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I was borne for nowe fare ye well.

If I haue demerited any loue or thanke at your handes, bestowe it wholly on my soonne, whan I am gone from you. Thus departed the moste vertuous ladye Quene Iane, whose deathe we haue the lesse cause to lamente, because that by hope we are assured, that she is gone from peyne to ioye, from care to reste, frō sorowe to blisse, frō this trāsitorie world to immortalitie. We haue cause to suppose that God for the exceadyng great loue and fauoure that he beareth towardes Englande, whan she had broughte foorthe to the worlde suche a soonne, tooke her awaye immediately of purpose to rewarde her wyth a croune eternall, for whome all temporall and worldely rewardes were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ouer basse, ne any yearthly croune sufficient: so that to lamente her, is rather to enuye her felicitie and blisse. And she beeyng nowe in heauen with her moste desired ioye Christe, inuiteth and requireth vs that our beneuolente loue and affeccion, whiche muste haue been deuided betwene you and her, maye bee wholy transferred and bestowed on your highnesse, whome to bryng foorthe she was not onely well contented, but also muche desyrous to dye. So that we are all double bounde to loue youre Maiestie, fyrste because youre moste dere mother was taken from vs ere she myght receyue any fruicte of our grate and thankfull hertes for bryngyng foorth to her coūtrey suche a soonne, and than muche more, because that in your moste Royall persone is reposed al the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioye, coumforte, hope, and expectacion bothe of vs that are nowe liuyng (whom I truste your Grace shall surutue,) and also of our posteritie. Neyther can Iiustely affyrme her to be dead, that hath leafte behynde her suche fruicte of her bodye, whome to bryng foorth (I dare auouche) she though her death so well bestowed, that in case she myght returne to lyfe again, and be in her former state of mayde &amp; Quene, she woulde readily paryshe &amp; couenaūt with God, on thesame pryce to bryng foorth your Grace vnto her countrey.

Whoso wyll peruse the bookes of the kynges, shall fynde that from the begynnyng of Achabs reygne vntill the tyme of good kyng E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias, true holinesse, religion, ryght knowleage of God, yea and the veraye mynde to weorke or seke Goddes glorye, lay as a thyng oppressed, reiected, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and vttrely extyncte, and in stede of Godlinesse reigned al iniquitie: in lieu of true knowlage, all was possessed with ignoraunce and errour: in place of true wurshyppyng of God, so ferre preuayled Idolatrye and contempte of Goddes lawes, that Israell passed the Gentyles not onely in theyr owne gentylitie of wurshypping Baal and many false Goddes, but also in al other kyndes of theyr moste detestable abhominacions. The crafty and subtile iugleyng of Baals priestes, and of the false prophetes for the aduauncyng of their owne lucre and estimacion, had vnder the coulour and pretence of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and of religion, by litle and litle so allured, enueigled, coniured, and bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the prynces: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they were vtterly blynded and seduced to condescende to the wicked and couetous inuencions of the priestes. They perswaded the Princes to theyr waies by policies, they bestowed all theyr cūning clergie, &amp; weorkemā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp of peincted eloquence, vntyll they had peruerted them and drawen them clene a straygh from all the wayes of the Lorde theyr true God, well knowyng that the people, some for loue, some for feare, and some through exaūple, woulde without any buisinesse folowe the trace and ledyng of theyr king &amp; gouernour. They made the kynges &amp; rewlers sure on theyr syde, well wetyng that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, some for obedience sake of theyr owne accorde would, and the rest by their cruell diuises myght by tyranny be enforced to drawe after theyr Princes line. Whereof the auncient prouerbe sayeth, that euery kyng is to his royalme and subiectes eyther a singuler precious benefite, orels a very pernicious destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> suche as euery kyng is, suche wil his people bee. Wherfore lyke as a werte or a molle standyng in a bodyes face is a more blemyshe, a greatter deformitee, &amp; a wurse disgracing, then if it stode in some priuie place of the body, where eyther the prouidēce of nature hideth it, or mānes own reuerēce and good prouision doeth kepe it secrete: so is a vyce or any eiuil qualytie a more fault &amp; a greatter dishonour in a Prince, then in an other priuate persone, because that euery his saying; doyng, yea &amp; euery his looke &amp; gesture, is taken vp as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exaumple and paterne for all hys subiectes to folowe: so that the kynges of Israel coulde not be ciuill, but to the veraie pernycious ensaumple and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupcion of al theyr sely people. But at length came good kyng. Ezechias, of whom the Scripture in his due commendacion testifieth, that he did that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lorde in al thyng, lyke to his forefather and progenitour Dauyd.

His well doynges he begoonne with the redresse of religion, and the extirpyng of idolatry vp by the rote. For whyle idolatry reigned, nothing could he doe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> myght be pleasyng to God. Fyrst of all therefore he put awaye the hil alters, &amp; brake the images &amp; cutte downe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> groues, and all to brake the brasen serpente that Moyses had made. (For vnto those dayes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chyldren of Israel dyd burne sacrifice vnto it.<note place="margin">Nume▪ xxi.</note>) He trusted in the Lorde God of Israel, he claue to the Lorde and departed not from hym, but kepte his commaundementes, and the Lorde was with hym, so that he prospered in all thynges whiche he tooke in hande. &amp;c. Thus, duryng y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of his reygne by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> space of twēty nine yeres, he renewed religion &amp; restored the lawe of God to his perfeccion: he reduced his people to the trade of holy and vpryght conuersacion in the syght of God, of walkyng in the commaundementes of the Lorde, detesting al Idolatrye &amp; abhorryng al suche abomynacions as myght iustely prouoke his wrathe &amp; vengeaunce.

And in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, if common writers in trifling profane matiers do with much high suit make meanes to obteine and vse the fauourable acceptacion of Princes, vnder whose name, title, &amp; proteccion any such weorke may be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and the better habled vnto the readers: how much are we al bound to your highnes, who of your own mere good zele and of your own accorde, doe willingly set forth in the English toung suche fruictfull bookes wherby all your people may bee edified in religion. Emong which verely I knowe not any one booke, whome for this purpose of briefly, pithily, sincerely, and familiarely expouning the new testament, I may iustly compare, or at leste wise preferre to thys presente Paraphrase of Erasmus, whiche lyke as the moste vertuous ladie Quene Katerine late wife of your moste noble father, and now of your ryghte derebeloued vnkle Syr thomas Seimour knight, Lorde Seimour of Sudley, and high admyrall of your Seaes, did ryght graciously procure to be translated into our vulgare toung, so your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie more graciously hath by your most godly iniuncciōs willed to be read, vsed, and studied by euery curate and pryeste to the vndoubted edifying as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of them, as of all other that with a desyre to knowe God, shall eyther reade or heare the same.

For what hath ben or is in any common weale the foundacion of spreading abrode the knowlage of Goddes woorde, but onely the setting forth of the Bible with other good and godly tractises for the declaracion of the same? What thing hath y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whelpes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romish Antichrist so fiercely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies backed against, as at the translating of Scripture and other bookes cōcerning matiers of religion into the vulgare tong for the vse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people? What any one thing is there, against the whiche there hath in all Christen Royalmes (as long as it might preuayle) been eyther sorer decrees, lawes, or inhibicions ordeined, or more terrible execucion of all kindes of tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and deathes inuented, deuised and put in vre, then againste the setters foorthe of bookes concernyng religyon?

what thing (I say) hath there been eyther more sorer thundreboltes shot, of deprauing, of accursing, of slaundreing, of defacing, of condemning, and of burning: then against bookes of scripture matiers, trāslated or writen in the mother lāguage, &amp; against the autours of the same? Until the Bible &amp; other good traitises for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> explanaciō of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same wer in Christian regions turned &amp; set forth in the vulgare languages: what kind of idolatry, supersticiō, pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, errour, ignorance, or counterfeict religion, did not reigne? As long as the candel light of the gospel was kepte hidden vnder the bushell: what King, what Prince, what countrey, what people did not the blind popish guides lede (as one that is blindfolde may be led) till both fel in the pit? But whan and whersoeuer it hath pleased God by his special mercy, grace, &amp; prouidēce to shew open the light of the gospel and true doctrine: there hath at once all popish troumperie euen of it selfe vanished away, as a mist is dispersed with the heate of the sonne, as smoke is consumed in the aier, as duste is blowen and scattered abrode with a puffe of winde, as the nyght geueth place to the bright day, and as darkenes vanisheth at the clere light of the sūne. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewise where the worde of God can not yet geat any entrie to take place, ne the bookes of holy Scripture obtein to be published to the people, what iye doth not see, and what Christian hert doth not lament and blede, to consider in what blindnes, supersticion, errour, vnquietnes of consciēce and trouble of minde, the sely people doe liue? It is therfore no smal benefite that suche persons do to a common weale, which are willingly trauaillers in this kind of writing. For as for newe bookes of trifleing vanities and profane argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes we nede none, there are daily so many writen: but to haue such weor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes made common to the publique vse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vnlearned multitude, as are the principal best, &amp; haue ben written by noble Clerkes of vndoudted learning, knowlage, and godlines, therin consisteth such a publique benefite, as (if I should not now be suspected &amp; demed to hunt for my selfe) is in mine estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, worthy publique thankes and regarde. For (as Erasmus in his third booke of Apothegmes, aswel by a sapient aunswer of Socrates, as also by two other preatie stories, the one of Leonicenus and thother of William Warham late Archbishop of Cantorbury doeth declare) muche more good, and a much greater benefit to a common weale doeth such an one, as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth or composeth any frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Now besides that such a translatour trauaileth not to hys own priuate commoditie, but to the behoufe &amp; publique vse of his countrey: besides that the thing is such as must so throughly occupie and possesse the dooer, and must haue him so attent to apply that same exercise onely, that he may not during that season take in hande any other trade of busines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to purchase his liuing: besides that the thing cannot be doen without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of long time, great watchyng, muche peines, diligente studye, no small charges aswell of meate, drinke, and bookes, as also of other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

A man hath hys owne inuencion readie at his owne pleasure without lettes or stoppes to make suche discourse as his argument requireth: but a translatour must of force in manier at euery other worde staigh, and suspend both his cogitaciō and his penne to looke vpon his autour, so that he might in egual time make thrise so muche, as he cā be hable to translate. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both a man shal apply hymself to doe, he can in the meane while dooe nothing els, he cannot-duryng the season bestow himselfe on any other occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciō for his liuing, &amp; his necessities &amp; also charges in the meane time neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse dooe growe aswel as other mennes. Wherof it cometh to passe, that a noumbre of suche as would be right willing and diligent to dooe good in the commō weale with this kinde of seruice: yet through defaulte of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie maintenaunce, cannot: and certain that hath both liuing &amp; vacaunt time enough, for as muche as they see the paines of this trauile so great, the hyre nothing at al, and the capciousnes of some maligners against the trueth, so readie to depraue the diligent laboure of studious writers: are for the moste parte of thē better contented (according to the accustomed prouerbe) to plaie for naught then to weorke for naught. And by this meanes lye almoste all good bookes hidden from the people, &amp; al disciplines vnknowen.

<pb facs="13"/>
and deuociō towardes god hath alreadie moued you to do. For of this yong and grene foundacion being yet very newly laied, thus much good edifying hath already growen in all persons consciences: that blasphemie, periurie, mourdre, thefte, whoordome, making of affraies, and other abhominacions are more detested, then they were in the blinde worlde very late yeres gone: which is a token, that Christ beginneth to dwel emōg vs. For as Christ gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, so shal vice weare away. And by egual degrees shal the loue of vertue and the hatered of vice grow in our hertes. A great mayny that haue hated matrimony, and yet haue not hated fornicacion, inceste, and aduoutry, begin now to abhorre and manifestly to flee these and other like pestilences, and to exercise the contraries. Which thing if some persones shal percase deny, and affirme to be otherwise, truely in mine opinion it is not so, but because it is in so great a numbre emended, looke where suche corrupcion stil remayneth, there doeth it better and more notably appere, as straunge thinges are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more wondred at. For al good and godly folke doe now wondre, that, Gods worde being spred abrode &amp; being now almoste in euery bodies hand and mouth so common, there should be any creature in whome any of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities afore mencioned shoulde reigne. But by Goddes grace and your Maiesties most holsome prouision it is to be hoped, that through this salue of Goddes woorde, and other deuoute weorkes for declaracion of the same sette foorthe to the people, if any shepe eyther be scabby, or els doe yet ren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straygh: the same shall by the right ledyng of the head belle weather theire Prince, and by the whystle and voyce of their good Pastours, be reduced to suche a concorde &amp; vniformitie, that they wil full and whole goe the streight pathway of Christes doctrine, vntil (according to his promisse) there shal of vs al be but one folde, and one shepeheard, as your most excellent Maiestie by setting forth suche bookes as may edify your people of all states and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the knowlage of goddes woorde &amp; in innocencie of life doth labour to haue it. Whiche your godly purpose and desire (if I may with your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pardone saye myne opinyon) I verayly suppose that no creature is of suche wicked herte to hindre, except if any such there be, (whiche thing God of his great mercy and grace forbid) that would not with his good wil haue your highnesse so wel to prosper, flourish, and growe, as to the honoure and glory of God, to the coumfort and reioysing of all your wel willers, to the terrour and drede of all your foes, and to the welth and honoure of all your Royalmes and dominions (God be thanked) ye nowe dooe. And doubt you not moste excellent Soueraygne, but that so long as your Maiestie by the aduise and assistence of your sayde most dere vncle and the other your moste honourable Counsailours, shall tendrely seke and setforth Gods glory, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and trayning your people to walke in his preceptes: so long wil God prosper you in all affaires, who can no more be false of his promisse, then he can ceasse to bee God. If ye reade the fifth chapitur of Iosue, and the fifth chapitur of Iudith, (besydes many places moe aswell in the bookes of the kinges, as also in other bookes of the Scriptures) ye shal plainly finde how merueilously God protected, saued, prospered, and preserued the people of Israel, so long as they walked in his preceptes truely &amp; sincerely wurship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him and keping his lawes, againste all the force and vyolence of all their enemies, were they neuer so innumerable, neuer so puissaunt, neuer so

well appoynted for battayl, nor neuer so fierce. In the fifth chapitur of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith emong other notable testimonies of Gods tendrenes ouer Israel, and by their example ouer al such as truely serue him, it is conteined, that whan worde came to Holofernes, Prince and Captain general of the warre of the Assirians vnder the king Nabugodonozor, how the children of Israel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themselfes, to make resistence against him and his armie Royal, and he demaunded many questions of the Princes of Moab &amp; of the Captaines of Ammon concerning the power of the Israelites: Achior the Captaine of all the Ammonites, whan he had in a long processe declared vnto Holofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes how wōdrefully Israel, whan they truly serued god, had euermore from tyme to tyme been preserued, and had preuayled againste all their enemies, and contrarie wyse howe God had alwayes plagued them whansoeuer they fell from hym to wurshippe false Goddes: thus doeth he conclude and knitte vp his oracion. Therefore my lorde (sayth he) make diligent inquisici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If this people haue doen wiekednes in the sight of their God, than lette vs goe vppe against them. For doubtlesse their God will deliuer them into thy handes, and subdue them vnto thy power. But yf this people haue not displeased their God, we shall not be hable to withstand them.
