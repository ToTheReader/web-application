   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Racious Ladies, so often as I consider
with my selfe, and obserue respectiuely, how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
you are enclined to compassion; as many
times do I acknowledge, that this present worke
of mine, will (in your iudgement) appeare to
haue but a harsh and offensiue b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ginning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the mournfull remembrance it beareth at
the verie entrance of the last Pestilentiall mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
vniuersally hurtfull to all that beheld it, or otherwise came to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it. But for all that, I desire it may not be so dreadfull to you, to
hinder your further proceeding in reading, as if none were to looke
thereon, but with sighes and teares. For, I could rather with, that so
fearefull a beginning, should seeme but as an high and steepy hil appeares
to them, that attempt to trauell farre on foote, and ascending the same
with some difficulty, come afterward to walk vpon a goodly euen plaine,
which causeth the more contentment in them, because the attaining
thereto was hard and painfull. For, euen as pleasures are cut off by griefe
and anguish; so sorrowes cease by ioyes most sweete and happie arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
   <p>After this breefe mollestation, briefe I say, because it is contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
small compasse of Writing; immediately followeth the most sweete
and pleasant taste of pleasure, whereof (before) I made promise to you.
Which (peraduenture) could not bee expected by such a beginning, if
promise stoode not thereunto engaged. And indeed, if I could wel haue
conueyed you to the center of my desire, by any other way, then so rude
<pb facs="8"/>
and rocky a passage as this is, I would gladly haue done it. But because
without this Narration, we could not demonstrate the occasion how and
wherefore the matters hapned, which you shall reade in the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses:
I must set them downe (euen as constrained thereto by meere
necessity) in writing after this manner.</p>
   <p>The yeare of our blessed Sauiours incarnation, 1348. that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mortality happened in the excellent City, farre beyond all the rest in
<hi>Italy;</hi> which plague, by operation of the superiour bodies, or rather for
our enormous iniquities, by the iust anger of God was sent vpon vs mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Some few yeeres before, it tooke beginning in the Easterne partes,
sweeping thence an innumerable quantity of liuing soules: extending it
selfe afterward from place to place Westward, vntill it seized on the said
City. Where neither humane skill or prouidence, could vse any preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
notwithstanding it was cleansed of many annoyances, by diligent
Officers thereto deputed: besides prohibition of all sickly persons ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and all possible prouision dayly vsed for conseruation of such as
were in health, with incessant prayers and supplications of deuoute peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for the asswaging of so dangerous a sicknesse.</p>
   <p>About the beginning of the yeare, it also began in very strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as appeared by diuers admirable effects; yet not as it had done in the
East Countries, where Lord or Lady being touched therewith, manifest
signes of incuitable death followed thereon, by bleeding at the nose. But
here it began with yong children, male and female, either vnder the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
or in the groine by certaine swellings, in some to the bignesse of an
Apple, in others like an Egge, and so in diuers greater or lesser, which (in
their vulgar Language) they termed to be a Botch or Byle. In very short
time after, those two infected parts were grown mortiferous, and would
disperse abroad indifferently, to all parts of the body; whereupon, such
was the qualitie of the disease, to shew it selfe by blacke or blew spottes,
which would appeare on the armes of many, others on their thighes, and
euerie part else of the body: in some great and few, in others small and
thicke.</p>
   <p>Now, as the Byle (at the beginning) was an assured signe of neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
death; so prooued the spots likewise to such as had them: for
the curing of which sicknesse it seemed, that the Physitians counsell, the
vertue of Medicines, or any application else, could not yeeld any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but rather it plainely appeared, that either the nature of the disease
would not endure it, or ignorance in the Physitians could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
from whence the cause prooceeded, and so by consequent, no reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was to be determined. Moreouer, beside the number of such as
were skilfull in Art, many more both women and men, without euer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any knowledge in Physicke, became Physitians: so that not onely
few were healed, but (well-neere) all dyed, within three dayes after the
saide signes were seene; some sooner, and others later, commonly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Feauer, or any other accident.</p>
   <p>And this pestilence was yet of farre greater power or violence; for, not
<pb n="2" facs="8"/>
onely healthfull persons speaking to the sicke, comming to see them, or
ayring cloathes in kindnesse to comfort them, was an occasion of ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death: but touching their garments, or any foode whereon the sicke
person fed, or any thing else vsed in his seruice, seemed to transferre the
disease from the sicke to the sound, in very rare and miraculous manner.
Among which matter of maruell, let me tell you one thing, which if the
eyes of many (as well as mine owne) had not seene, hardly could I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to write it, much lesse to beleeue it, albeit a man of good credit
should report it. I say, that the quality of this contagious pestilence was
not onely of such efficacy, in taking and catching it one of another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men or women: but it extended further, euen in the apparant view
of many, that the cloathes, or any thing else, wherein one died of that
disease, being toucht, or lyen on by any beast, farre from the kind or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of man, they did not onely contaminate and infect the said beast, were
it Dogge, Cat, or any other; but also it died very soone after.</p>
   <p>Mine owne eyes (as formerly I haue said) among diuers other, one day
had euident experience hereof, for some poore ragged cloathes of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
and wollen, torne from a wretched body dead of that disease, and
hurled in the open streete; two Swine going by, and (according to their
naturall inclination) seeking for foode on euery dung-hill, tossed and
tumbled the cloathes with their snouts, rubbing their heads likewise vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them; and immediately, each turning twice or thrice about, they
both fell downe dead on the saide cloathes, as being fully infected with
the contagion of them: which accident, and other the like, if not far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
begat diuers feares and imaginations in them that beheld them, all
tending to a most inhumane and vncharitable end; namely, to flie thence
from the sicke, and touching any thing of theirs, by which meanes they
thought their health should be safely warranted.</p>
   <p>Some there were, who considered with themselues, that liuing sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with abstinence from all superfluity; it would be a sufficient resistance
against all hurtfull accidents. So combining themselues in a sociable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
they liued as separatists from all other company, being shut vp in
such houses, where no sicke body should be neere them. And there, for
their more security, they vsed delicate viands and excellent wines, auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
luxurie, and refusing speech to one another, not looking forth at
the windowes, to heare no cries of dying people, or see any coarses car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to buriall; but hauing musicall instruments, liued there in all possible
pleasure. Others were of a contrary opinion, who auouched, that there
was no other physicke more certaine, for a disease so desperate, then to
drinke hard, be merry among themselues, singing continually, walking
euery where, and satisfying their appetites with whatsoeuer they desired,
laughing, and mocking at euery mournefull accident, and so they vowed
to spend day and night: for now they would goe to one Tauerne, then to
another, liuing without any rule or measure; which they might very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
doe, because euery one of them, (as if he were to liue no longer in this
World) had euen forsaken all things that he had. By meanes whereof
<pb facs="9"/>
the most part of the houses were become common, and all strangers,
might doe the like (if they pleased to aduenture it) euen as boldly as the
Lord or owner, without any let or contradiction.</p>
   <p>Yet in all this their beastly behauiour, they were wise enough, to shun
(so much as they might) the weake and sickly: In which misery and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of our City, the venerable authority of the Lawes, as well diuine
as humane, was euen destroyed, as it were, through want of the awefull
Ministers of them. For they being all dead, or lying sicke with the rest,
or else liued so solitary, in such great necessity of seruants and attendants,
as they could not execute any office, whereby it was lawfull for euery one
to doe as he listed.</p>
   <p>Betweene these two rehearsed extremities of life, there were other of
a more moderate temper, not being so daintily dieted as the first, nor
drinking so dissolutely as the second; but vsed all things sufficient for
their appetites, and without shutting vp themselues, walked abroade,
some carrying sweete nose-gayes of flowers in their hands; others odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
herbes, and others diuers kinds of spiceries, holding them to their
noses, and thinking them most comfortable for the braine, because the
ayre seemed to be much infected, by the noysome smell of dead carkases,
and other hurtfull sauours. Some other there were also of more inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
minde (howbeit peraduenture it might be the surest) saying, that
there was no better physicke against the pestilence, nor yet so good; as to
flie away from it, which argument mainely mouing them, and caring for
no body but themselues, very many, both men and women, forsooke the
City, their owne houses, their Parents, kindred, friends, and goods, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to other mens dwellings else-where. As if the wrath of God, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the sinnes of men with this plague, would fall heauily vpon none,
but such as were enclosed within the City wals; or else perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that not any one should there be left aliue, but that the finall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of all things was come.</p>
   <p>Now albeit these persons in their diuersity of opinions died not all, so
vndoubtedly they did not all escape; but many among them becomming
sicke, and making a generall example of their flight and folly, among
them that could not stirre out of their beds, they languished more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexedly
then the other did. Let vs omit, that one Citizen fled after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and one neighbour had not any care of another, Parents nor kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
neuer visiting them, but vtterly they were forsaken on all sides: this
tribulation pierced into the hearts of men, and with such a dreadfull ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that one Brother forsooke another; the Vnkle the Nephew, the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Brother, and the Wife her Husband: nay, a matter much greater,
and almost incredible; Fathers and Mothers fled away from their owne
Children▪ euen as if they had no way appertained to them. In regard
whereof, it could be no otherwise, but that a countlesse multitude of men
and women fell sicke; finding no charity among their friends, except a
very few, and subiected to the auarice of seruants, who attended them
constrainedly, for great and vnreasonable wages) yet few of those atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>
to be found any where too. And they were men or women but of
base condition, as also of groser vnderstanding, who neuer before had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in any such necessities, nor indeed were any way else to be imployed,
but to giue the sicke person such things as he called for, or to awaite the
houre of his death; in the performance of which seruices, oftentimes for
gaine, they lost their owne liues.</p>
   <p>In this extreame calamity, the sicke being thus forsaken of neighbors,
kinred, and friends, standing also in such need of seruants; a custome came
vp among them, neuer heard of before, that there was not any woman,
how noble, young, or faire soeuer shee was, but falling sicke, shee must of
necessity haue a man to attend her, were he young or otherwise, respect
of shame or modesty no way preuailing, but all parts of her body must
be discouered to him, which (in the like vrgency) was not to be seene by
any but women: whereon ensued afterward, that vpon the parties hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and recouery, it was the occasion of further dishonesty, which many
being more modestly curious of, refused such disgracefull attending, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
rather to die, then by such helpe to be healed. In regard whereof, as
well through the want of conuenient remedies, (which the sicke by no
meanes could attain vnto) as also the violence of the contagion, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of them that died night and day, was so great, that it was a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sight to behold, and as much to heare spoken of. So that meere neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
(among them that remained liuing) begat new behauiours, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all which had beene in former times, and frequently vsed among
the City Inhabitants.</p>
   <p>The custome of precedent dayes (as now againe it is) was, that women,
kinred, neighbours, and friends, would meete together at the deceased
parties house, and there, with them that were of neerest alliance, expresse
their hearts sorrow for their friends losse. If not thus, they would assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before the doore, with many of the best Cittizens and kindred, and
(according to the quality of the deceased) the Clergy met there likewise,
and the dead body was carried (in comely manner) on mens shoulders,
with funerall pompe of Torch-light, and singing, to the Church appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the deceased. But these seemely orders, after that the fury of the
pestilence began to encrease, they in like manner altogether ceased, and
other new customes came in their place; because not onely people died,
without hauing any women about them, but infinites also past out of this
life, not hauing any witnesse, how, when, or in what manner they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So that few or none there were, to deliuer outward shew of sorrow
and grieuing: but insteed thereof, diuers declared idle ioy and reioycing,
a vse soone learned of immodest women, hauing put off al feminine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
yea, or regard of their owne welfare.</p>
   <p>Very few also would accompany the body to the graue, and they not
any of the Neighbours, although it had beene an honourable Cittizen,
but onely the meanest kinde of people, such as were graue-makers, coffin-bearers,
or the like, that did these seruices onely for money, and the beere
being mounted on their shoulders, in all haste they would runne away
<pb facs="10"/>
with it, not perhaps to the Church appointed by the dead, but to the nee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rest
at hand, hauing some foure or sixe poore Priests following, with
lights or no lights, and those of the silliest; short seruice being said at the
buriall, and the body vnreuerently throwne into the first open graue they
found. Such was the pittifull misery of poore people, and diuers, who
were of better condition, as it was most lamentable to behold; because
the greater number of them, vnder hope of healing, or compelled by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty,
kept still within their houses weake and faint, thousands falling sick
daily, and hauing no helpe, or being succoured any way with foode or
physicke, all of them died, few or none escaping.</p>
   <p>Great store there were, that died in the streetes by day or night, and
many more beside, although they died in their houses; yet first they made
it knowne to their neighbours, that their liues perished, rather by the
noysome smell of dead and putrified bodies, then by any violence of the
disease in themselues. So that of these and the rest, dying in this manner
euery where, the neighbours obserued one course of behauiour, (moued
thereto no lesse by feare, that the smell and corruption of dead bodies
should harme them, then charitable respect of the dead) that themselues
when they could, or being assisted by some bearers of coarses, when they
wer able to procure thē, wold hale the bodies (alreadie dead) out of their
houses, laying them before their doores, where such as passed by, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the mornings, might see them lying in no meane numbers. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Bieres were brought thither, and such as might not haue the helpe
of Bieres, were glad to lay them on tables; and Bieres haue bin obserued,
not onely to be charged with two or three dead bodies at once, but many
times it was seene also, that the wife with the husband, two or three Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
together; yea, the Father and the mother, haue thus beene carried
along to the graue vpon one Biere.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, oftentimes it hath bene seene, that when two Priests went
with one Crosse to fetch the body; there would follow (behind) three or
foure bearers with their Bieres, and when the Priests intended the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
but of one bodie, sixe or eight more haue made vp the aduantage, and
yet none of them being attended by any seemly company, lights, teares,
or the very least decencie, but it plainly appeared, that the verie like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
was then made of men or Women, as if they had bene Dogges or
Swine. Wherein might manifestly bee noted, that that which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
course of things could not shewe to the wise, with rare and little
losse, to wit, the patient support of miseries and misfortunes, euen in
their greatest height: not onely the wise might now learne, but also th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
verie simplest people; &amp; in such sort, that they should alwaies be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against all infelicities whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p>Hallowed ground could not now suffice, for the great multitude of
dead bodies, which were daily brought to euery Church in the City, and
euery houre in the day; neither could the bodies haue proper place of
buriall, according to our ancient custome: wherfore, after that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Church-yards were filled, they were constrained to make vse of
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>
great deepe ditches, wherein they were buried by hundreds at once, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
dead bodies along in graues, as Merchandizes are laide along in
ships, couering each after other with a small quantity of earth, &amp; so they
filled at last vp the whole ditch to the brim.</p>
   <p>Now, because I would wander no further in euerie particularity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the miseries happening in our Citie: I tell you, that extremities
running on in such manner as you haue heard; little lesse spare was made
in the Villages round about; wherein (setting aside enclosed Castles,
which were now filled like to small Cities) poore Labourers and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men,
with their whole Families, dyed most miserably in out-houses,
yea, and in the open fieldes also; without any assistance of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
or helpe of seruants; &amp; likewise in the high-wayes, or their plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
landes, by day or night indifferently, yet not as men, but like brute
beasts.</p>
   <p>By meanes whereof, they became lazie and slothfull in their daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours,
euen like to our Citizens; not minding or medling with their
wonted affaires: but, as awaiting for death euery houre, imployed all
their paines, not in caring any way for themselues, their cattle, or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the fruits of the earth, or any of their accustomed labours; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wasted and consumed, euen such as were for their instant sustenance.
Whereupon, it fell so out, that their Oxen, Asses, Sheepe, and Goates,
their Swine, Pullen, yea their verie Dogges, the truest and faithfullest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to men, being beaten and banished from their houses, went wildly
wandring abroad in the fields, where the Corne grew still on the ground
without gathering, or being so much as reapt or cut. Many of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
beasts (as endued with reason) after they had pastured themselues in
the day time, would returne full fed at night home to their houses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any gouernment of Heardsmen, or any other.</p>
   <p>How many faire Palaces! How many goodly Houses! How many
noble habitations, filled before with families of Lords and Ladies, were
then to be seene emptie, without any one there dwelling, except some sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seruant? How many Kindreds, worthy of memory! How many great
inheritances! And what plenty of riches, were left without any true
successours? How many good men! How many woorthy Women!
How many valiant and comely yong men, whom none but <hi>Galen, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
and <hi>Aesculapius</hi> (if they were liuing) could haue bene reputed any
way vnhealthfull; were seene to dine at morning, with their Parents,
Friends, and familiar confederates, and went to sup in another world
with their Predecessors?</p>
   <p>It is no meane breach to my braine, to make repetition of so many
miseries; wherefore, being willing to part with them as easily as I may:
I say that our Citie being in this case, voide of inhabitants, it came to
passe (as afterward I vnderstoode by some of good credite) that in the
venerable Church of S. <hi>Marie la Neufue,</hi> on a Tuesday morning, there
being then no other person, after the hearing of diuine Seruice, in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
habits (as the season required) returned thence seuen discreet yong
<pb facs="11"/>
Gentlewomen, all allyed together, either by friendship, neighbor-hood,
or parentage. She among them that was most entred into yeares, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not eight and twenty; and the yongest was no lesse then eighteene;
being of Noble descent, faire forme, adorned with exquisite behauiour,
and gracious modesty.</p>
   <p>Their names I could report, if iust occasion did not forbid it, in regard
of the occasions following by them related, and because times heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall not taxe them with reproofe; the lawes of pleasure being more
straited now adayes (for the matters before reucaled) then at that time
they were, not onely to their yeares, but to many much riper. Neither
will I likewise minister matter to rash heades (ouer-readie in censuring
commendable life) any way to impaire the honestie of Ladies, by their
idle detracting speeches. And therefore, to the end that what each of thē
saith, may be comprehended without confusion; I purpose to stile them
by names, wholly agreeing, or (in part) conformable to their qualities.
The first and most aged, we will name <hi>Pampinea;</hi> the second <hi>Fiametta;</hi>
the third <hi>Philamena;</hi> the fourth <hi>Aemilia;</hi> the fift <hi>Lauretta;</hi> the sixt <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phila;</hi>
and the last we terme (not without occasion) <hi>Elissa,</hi> or <hi>Eliza.</hi> All
of them being assembled at a corner of the Church, not by any delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
formerly appointed, but meerely by accident, and sitting as it were
in a round ring: after diuers sighs seuerally deliuered, they conferred on
sundry matters answerable to the sad qualitie of the time, and vvithin a
while after, Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> began in this manner.</p>
   <p>Faire Ladies, you may (no doubt as well as I) haue often heard, that
no iniury is offered to any one, by such as make vse but of their owne
right. It is a thing naturall for euerie one which is borne in this World,
to aide, conserue, and defend her life so long as shee can; and this right
hath bene so powerfully permitted, that although it hath sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that (to defend themselues) men haue beene slaine without any
offence: yet Lawes haue allowed it to be so, in whose solicitude lieth the
best liuing of all mortals. How much more honest and iust is it then for
vs, and for euery other well-disposed person, to seeke for (without wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any) and to practise all remedies that wee can, for the conseruation
of our liues? When I well consider, what we haue heere done this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and many other already past; remembring (withall) what likewise
is proper and conuenient for vs: I conceiue (as all you may do the like)
that euerie one of vs hath a due respect of her selfe, and then I meruaile
not, but rather am much amazed (knowing none of vs to be depriued of
a Womans best iudgement) that wee seeke not after some remedies for
our selues, against that, which euery one among vs, ought (in reason) to
feare.</p>
   <p>Heere we meete and remaine (as it seemeth to mee) in no other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then as if we would or should be witnesses, to all the dead bodies at
rest in their graues; or else to listen, when the religious Sisters here dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(whose number now are well-neere come to be none at all) sing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
at such houres as they ought to do; or else to acquaint all commers
<pb facs="11"/>
hither (by our mourning habites) with the quality and quantitie of our
hearts miseries. And when we part hence, we meete with none but dead
bodies; or sicke persons transported from one place to another; or else
we see running thorow the City (in most offensiue fury) such as (by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of publike Lawes) were banished hence, onely for their bad and
bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>sh behauiour in contempt of those Lawes, because now they know,
that the executors of them are dead and sicke. And if not these, more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
spectacles present themselues to vs, by the base rascality of the
Citie; who being fatted with our blood, tearme themselues Graue-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and in meere contemptible mockerie of vs, are mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
gallopping euerie where, reproaching vs with our losses and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
with lewd and dishonest songs: so that we can hear nothing els
but such and such are dead, and such and such lie a dying; heere hands
wringing, and euerie where most pittifull complaining.</p>
   <p>If we returne home to our houses (I know not whether your case bee
answerable to mine) when I can finde none of all my Family, but onely
my poore waiting Chamber-maide; so great are my feares, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
haire on my head declareth my amazement, and wheresoeuer I go or
sit downe, me thinkes I see the ghostes and shadowes of deceased friends,
not with such louely lookes as I was wont to behold them, but with most
horrid and dreadfull regards, newly stolne vpon them I know not how.
In these respects, both heere, else-where, and at home in my house, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
I am alwaies ill, and much more (in mine owne opinion) then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other bodie, not hauing meanes or place of retirement, as all we haue,
and none to remaine heere but onely we.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I haue often heard it said, that in tarrying or departing, no
distinction is made in things honest or dishonest; onely appetite will be
serued; and be they alone or in company, by day or night, they do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
their appetite desireth: not secular persons onely, but such as are
recluses, and shut vp within Monasteries, breaking the Lawes of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and being addicted to pleasures of the flesh, are become lasciuious
and dissolute, making the world beleeue, that whatsoeuer is conuenient
for other women, is no way vnbeseeming them, as thinking in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to escape.</p>
   <p>If it be so, as manifestlie it maketh shew of it selfe; What do we here?
What stay we for? And whereon do we dreame? Why are we more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectlesse
of our health, then all the rest of the Citizens? Repute we our
selues lesse precious then all the other? Or do we beleeue, that life is lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to our bodies with stronger chaines, then to others, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should not feare any thing that hath power to offend vs? Wee
erre therein, and are deceiued. What brutishnesse were it in vs, if wee
should vrge any such beleefe? So often as wee call to minde, what, and
how many gallant yong men and women, haue beene deuoured by this
cruell pestilence; wee may euidently obserue a contrary argument.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, to the end, that by being ouer-scrupulous and carelesse,
we fall not into such danger, whence when we would (perhaps) we cānot
<pb facs="12"/>
recouer our selues by any meanes: I thinke it meete (if your iudgement
therein shall iumpe with mine) that all of vs as we are (at least, if we will
doe as diuers before vs haue done, and yet daily endeauour to doe) shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
death by the honest example of other, make our retreate to our
Countrey houses, wherewith all of vs are sufficiently furnished, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
delight our selues as best we may, yet without transgressing (in any act)
the limits of reason. There shall we heare the pretty birds sweetly sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
see the hilles and plaines verdantly flourishing; the Corne twaning
in the field like the billowes of the Sea; infinite store of goodly trees, and
the Heauens more fairely open to vs, then here we can behold them: And
although they are iustly displeased, yet will they not there denie vs better
beauties to gaze on, then the walles in our City (emptied of Inhabitants)
can offoord vs.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, the Ayre is much fresh and cleere, and generally, there is
farre greater abundance of all things whatsoeuer, needefull at this time
for preseruation of our health, and lesse offence or mollestation then wee
find here.</p>
   <p>And although Countrey people die, as well as heere our Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
doe, the griefe notwithstanding is so much the lesse, as the houses
and dwellers there are rare, in comparison of them in our City. And
beside, if we well obserue it, here wee forsake no particular person, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee may tearme our selues forsaken; in regard that our Husbands,
Kinred, and Friends, either dying, or flying from the dead, haue left vs
alone in this great affliction, euen as if we were no way belonging vnto
them. And therefore, by following this counsell, wee cannot fall into
any reprehension; whereas if we neglect and refuse it, danger, distresse,
and death, (perhaps) may ensue thereon.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, if you thinke good, I would allow it for well done, to
take our waiting women, with all such things as are needfull for vs, and
(as this day) betake our selues to one place, to morrow to another, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
there such pleasure and recreation, as so sweete a season liberally
bestoweth on vs. In which manner we may remaine, till we see (if death
otherwise preuent vs not) what ende the gracious Heauens haue reserued
for vs. I would haue you also to consider, that it is no lesse seemely for
vs to part hence honestly, then a great number of other Women to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
here immodestly.</p>
   <p>The other Ladies and Gentlewomen, hauing heard Madam <hi>Pampinea,</hi>
not onely commended her counsell, but desiring also to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
had already particularly consulted with themselues, by what means
they might instantly depart from thence. Neuerthelesse, Madam <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
who was very wise, spake thus.</p>
   <p>Albeit faire Ladies, the case propounded by Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> hath
beene very wel deliuered; yet (for all that) it is against reason for vs to rush
on, as we are ouer-ready to doe. Remember that we are all women, and
no one among vs is so childish, but may consider, that when wee
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
shall be so assembled together, without prouidence or conduct of some
man, we can hardly gouerne our selues. We are fraile, offensiue, suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
weake spirited, and fearefull: in regard of which imperfections, I
greatly doubt (if we haue no better direction then our owne) this society
will sooner dissolue it selfe, and (perchance) with lesse honour to vs, then
if we neuer had begunne it. And therefore it shall be expedient for vs,
to prouide before wee proceede any further. Madam <hi>Elissa</hi> hereon thus
replied.</p>
   <p>Most true it is, that men are the chiefe or head of women, and without
their order, sildome times doe any matters of ours sort to commendable
ende. But what meanes shal we make for men? we all know well enough,
that the most part of our friends are dead, and such as are liuing, some be
dispearsed here, others there, into diuers places and companies, where
we haue no knowledge of their being. And to accept of strangers, would
seeme very inconuenient; wherefore as we haue such care of our health,
so should wee be as respectiue (withall) in ordering our intention: that
wheresoeuer wee aime at our pleasure and contentment, reproofe and
scandall may by no meanes pursue vs.</p>
   <p>While this discourse thus held among the Ladies, three young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
came forth of the Church (yet not so young, but the youngest
had attained to fiue and twenty yeeres) in whom, neither malice of the
time, losse of friends or kinred, nor any fearefull conceit in themselues,
had the power to quench affection; but (perhaps) might a little coole it,
in regard of the queazy season. One of them called himselfe <hi>Pamphilus,</hi>
the second <hi>Philostratus,</hi> and the last <hi>Dioneus.</hi> Each of them was very affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and well conditioned, and walked abroade (for their greater comfort
in such a time of tribulation) to trie if they could meete with their faire
friends, who (happily) might all three be among these seauen, and the
rest kinne vnto them in one degree or other. No sooner were these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
espyed by them, but they met with them also in the same aduantage;
whereupon Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> (amiably smiling) saide.</p>
   <p>See how graciously Fortune is fauourable to our beginning, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
our eyes with three so wise and worthy young Gentlemen, who
will gladly be our guides and seruants, if we doe not disdaine them the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Madam <hi>Neiphila</hi> beganne immediatly to blush, because one of them
had a loue in the company, and saide; Good Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> take heed
what you say, because (of mine owne knowledge) nothing can be spoken
but good of them all; and I thinke them all to be absolutely sufficient, for
a farre greater employment then is here intended: as being well worthy
to keepe company, not onely with vs, but them of more faire and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
esteeme then we are. But because it appeareth plainely enough, that
they beare affection to some here among vs: I feare, if wee should make
the motion, that some dishonour or reproofe may ensue thereby, and yet
without blame either in vs or them. That is nothing at all, answered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Philomena,</hi> let mee liue honestly, and my conscience not checke me
with any crime; speake then who can to the contrary, God and truth shal
<pb facs="13"/>
enter armes for me. I wish that they were as willing to come, as all wee
are to bid them welcome: for truly (as Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> saide) wee may
very well hope that Fortune will bee furtherous to our purposed iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
   <p>The other Ladies hearing them speake in such manner, not onely were
silent to themselues, but all with one accord and consent saide, that it were
well done to call them, and to acquaint them with their intention, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
their company in so pleasant a voyage. Whereupon, without
any more words, Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> mounting on her feete (because one
of the three was her Kinsman) went towards the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, as they stood respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
obseruing them; and (with a pleasing countenance) giuing them a
gracious salutation, declared to them their deliberation, desiring (in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of all the rest) that with a brotherly and modest minde, they would
vouchsafe to beare them company.</p>
   <p>The Gentlemen imagined at the first apprehension, that this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in mockage of them, but when they better perceiued, that her words
tended to solemne earnest; they made answer, that they were all heartily
ready to doe them any seruice. And without any further delaying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they parted thence, tooke order for their aptest furnishing withall
conuenient necessaries, and sent word to the place of their first appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
On the morrow, being Wednesday, about breake of day, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
with certaine of their attending Gentlewomen, and the three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
hauing three seruants to waite on them; left the City to beginne
their iourney, and hauing trauelled about a leagues distance, arriued at
the place of their first purpose of stay; which was seated on a little hill,
distant (on all sides) from any high way, plentifully stored with faire sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Trees, affoording no meane delight to the eye. On the top of all
stood a stately Pallace, hauing a large and spacious Court in the middest,
round engirt with galleries, hals and chambers, euery one separate alone
by themselues, and beautified with pictures of admirable cunning. Nor
was there any want of Gardens, Meadowes, and other pleasant walkes,
with welles and springs of faire running waters, all encompassed with
branching vines, fitter for curious and quaffing bibbers, then women so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and singularly modest.</p>
   <p>This Pallace the company found fully fitted and prepared, the beddes
in the Chambers made and daintily ordered, thickly strewed with variety
of flowres, which could not but giue them the greater contentment. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi>
who (aboue the other) was a pleasant young gallant, and full of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
witty conceits, saide; Your wit (faire Ladies) hath better guided vs
hither, then our prouidence. I know not how you haue determined to
dispose of your cares; as for mine owne, I left them at the City gate,
when I came thence with you: and therefore let your resolution be, to
spend the time here in smiles and singing (I meane, as may fittest agree
with your dignity) or else giue me leaue to goe seeke my sorrowes againe,
and so to remaine discontented in our desolate City. Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi>
hauing in like manner shaken off her sorrowes, deliuering a modest and
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
bashfull smile, replied in this manner.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Dioneus,</hi> well haue you spoken, it is fit to liue merrily, and no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
made vs forsake the sicke and sad Citie. But, because such things
as are without meane or measure, are subiect to no long continuance.
I, who began the motion, whereby this society is thus assembled, and
ayme at the long lasting thereof: doe hold it very conuenient, that wee
should all agree, to haue one chiefe commaunder among vs, in whom
the care and prouidence should consist, for direction of our merriment,
performing honour and obedience to the party, as to our Patrone and
sole Gouernour. And because euery one may feele the burthen of solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
as also the pleasure of commaunding, and consequently haue a
sensible taste of both, whereby no enuie may arise on any side: I could
wish, that each one of vs (for a day onely) should feele both the burthen
and honour, and the person so to be aduanced, shall receiue it from the
election of vs all. As for such as are to succeede, after him or her that
hath had the dayes of dominion: the party thought fit for succession,
must be named so soone as night approacheth. And being in this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
(according as he or she shall please) hee may order and dispose,
how long the time of his rule shall last, as also of the place and manner,
where best we may continue our delight.</p>
   <p>These words were highly pleasing to them all, and, by generall voyce,
Madame <hi>Pampinea</hi> was chosen Queene for the first day. Whereupon,
Madame <hi>Philomena</hi> ranne presently to a Bay-tree, because she had often
heard, what honour belonged to those branches, and how worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
they were, that rightfully were crowned with them, plucking off di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
branches, she made of them an apparant and honourable Chaplet,
placing it (by generall consent) vpon her head, and this, so long as their
company continued, manifested to all the rest, the signall of dominion
and Royall greatnesse.</p>
   <p>After that Madame <hi>Pampinea</hi> was thus made Queene, she commanded
publique silence, and causing the Gentlemens three seruants, and the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
women also (being foure in number) to be brought before her, thus
shee began. Because I am to giue the first example to you all, whereby
(proceeding on from good to better) our company may liue in order
and pleasure, acceptable to all, and without shame to any: I create <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno</hi>
(seruant to <hi>Dioneus</hi>) Maister of the Houshold, hee taking the care
and charge of all our t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ayne, and for whatsoeuer appertaineth to our
Hall seruice. I appoint also that <hi>Silisco</hi> (seruant to <hi>Pamphilus</hi>) shall be
our Dispencer and Treasurer, performing that which <hi>Parmeno</hi> shall
commaund him. And that <hi>Tindaro</hi> serue as Groome of the Chamber, to
<hi>Philostratus</hi> his Maister, and the other two, when his fellowes (impeached
by their offices) cannot be present. <hi>Misia</hi> my Chambermaid, and <hi>Licisca</hi>
(belonging to <hi>Philomena</hi>) shall serue continually in the Kitchin) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
make ready such vyands, as shall be deliuered them by <hi>Parmeno▪
Chimera,</hi> wayting-woman to <hi>Lauretta,</hi> and <hi>Stratilia</hi> (appertaining to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammetta</hi>)
shall haue the charge and gouernement of the Ladies Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb facs="14"/>
and preparing all places where we shall be present. Moreouer, we
will and commaund euery one of them (as they desire to deserue our
grace) that wheresoeuer they goe or come, or whatsoeuer they heare or
see: they especially respect to bring vs tydings of them. After shee had
summarily deliuered them these orders, very much commended of euery
one; shee arose fearefully, saying. Heere wee haue Gardens, Orchards,
Meadowes, and other places of sufficient pleasure, where euery one may
sport &amp; recreate themselues: but so soone as the ninth houre striketh, then
all to meete here againe, to dine in the coole shade.</p>
   <p>This iocund company hauing receiued licence from their Queene to
disport themselues, the Gentlemen walked with the Ladies into a goodly
Garden, making Chaplets and Nosegayes of diuers flowers, and singing
silently to themselues. When they had spent the time limitted by the
Queene, they returned into the house, where they found that <hi>Parmeno</hi>
had effectually executed his office. For, when they entred into the Hall,
they saw the Tables couered with delicate white naperie, and the Glasses
looking like siluer, they were so transparantly cleare, all the roome beside
streamed with flames of Iuniper. When the Queene and all the rest had
washed; according as <hi>Parmeno</hi> gaue order, so euery one was seated at the
Table: the vyands (delicately drest) were serued in, and excellent wines
plentifully deliuered, none attending but the three seruants, and little or
no loud table-talke passing among them.</p>
   <p>Dinner being ended, and the tables withdrawne (all the Ladies, and
the Gentlemen likewise, being skilfull both in singing and dauncing, and
playing on instruments artificially) the Queene commaunded, that diuers
instruments should be brought, and (as she gaue charge) <hi>Dioneus</hi> tooke a
Lute, and <hi>Fiammetta</hi> a Violl <hi>de gamba,</hi> and began to play an excellent
daunce. Whereupon the Queene, with the rest of the Ladies, and the
other two young Gentlemen (hauing sent their attending seruants to
dinner) paced foorth a daunce very maiestically. And when the daunce
was ended, they sung sundry excellent Canzonets, out-wearing so the
time, vntill the Queene commaunded them all to rest, because the houre
did necessarily require it. The Gentlemen hauing their Chambers farre
seuered from the Ladies, curiously strewed with flowers, and their beds
adorned in exquisite manner, as those of the Ladies were not a iote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to them: the silence of the night bestowed sweet rest on them all.
In the morning, the Queene and all the rest being risen, accounting ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
sleepe to be very hurtfull: they walked abroade into a goodly Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
where the grasse grew verdantly, and the beames of the Sunne
heated not ouer-violently, because the shades of faire spreading trees
gaue a temperate calmenesse, coole and gentle winds fanning their sweet
breath pleasingly among them. All of them being there set downe in a
round ring, and the Queene in the middest, as being the appointed place
of eminencie, she spake in this manner.</p>
   <p>You see (faire company) that the Sunne is highly mounted, the heate
(else-where) too extreme for vs, and therfore here is our fittest refuge, the
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
aire being so coole, delicate, and acceptable, and our folly well worthie
reprehension, if we should walke further, and speede worse. Heere are
Tables, Cards, and Chesse, as your dispositions may be addicted. But
if mine aduice might passe for currant, I would admit none of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
because they are too troublesome both to them that play, and
such as looke on. I could rather wish, that some quaint discourse might
passe among vs, a tale or fable related by some one, to vrge the attention
of all the rest. And so wearing out the warmth of the day, one prety No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
wil draw on another, vntil the Sun be lower declined, and the heates
extremity more diminished, to solace our selues in some other place, as
to our minds shal seeme conuenient. If therefore what I haue sayde be
acceptable to you (I purposing to follow in the same course of pleasure,)
let it appeare by your immediate answer; for, til the Euening, I think we
can deuise no exercise more commodious for vs.</p>
   <p>The Ladies &amp; Gentlemen allowed of the motion, to spend the time
in telling pleasant tales; whereupon the Queene saide: Seeing you haue
approoued mine aduice, I grant free permission for this first day, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one shall relate, what to him or her is best pleasing. And turning
her selfe to <hi>Pamphilus</hi> (who was seated on her right hand) gaue him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
with one of his Nouels, to begin the recreation: which he not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to deny, and perceiuing generall attention prepared for him, thus
he began.</p>

by his especiall grace and fauour, giue vs not strength and good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Which power we may not beleeue, that either it descendeth
<pb facs="15"/>
to vs, or liueth in vs, by any merites of our owne; but of his onely most
gracious benignity. Mooued neuerthelesse, and entreated by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of them, who were (as we are) mortals; and hauing diligently
obserued his commandements, are now with him in eternall blessednes.
To whom (as to aduocates and procurators, informed by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our frailty) wee are not to present our prayers in the presence of
so great a Iudge; but only to himselfe, for the obtaining of all such things
as his wisedome knoweth to be most expedient for vs. And well may we
credit, that his goodnesse is more fully enclined towards vs, in his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
bounty and liberality; then the subtilty of any mortal eye, can reach
into the secret of so diuine a thought: and sometimes therefore we may
be beguiled in opinion, by electing such and such as our intercessors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his high Maiesty, who perhaps are farre off from him, or driuen into
perpetuall exile, as vnworthy to appeare in so glorious a presence. For
he, from whom nothing can be hidden, more regardeth the sincerity of
him that prayeth, then ignorant deuotion, committed to the trust of a
heedlesse intercessor; and such prayers haue alwaies gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his sight. As manifestly will appeare, by the Nouell which I intend
to relate; manifestly (I say) not as in the iudgement of God, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ahprehension of men.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>There was one
named, <hi>Musciatto
Francesi,</hi> who from
beeing a most rich
and great merchant
in <hi>France,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Knight, and
preparing to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> with
Monsieur <hi>Charles
without Land,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the King of
France (who vvas
desired and incited
to come thither by
Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>) foūd
his affaires greatly
intricated here and
there (as oftentimes the matters of Merchants fall out to bee) and that
very hardly hee should sodainly vnintangle them, without referring the
charge of them to diuers persons. And for all he tooke indifferent good
order, onely he remained doubtfull, whom he might sufficiently leaue, to
recouer his debts among many <hi>Burgundians.</hi> And the rather was his care
the more herein, because he knew the <hi>Burgundians</hi> to be people of badde
nature, rioters, brablers, full of calumny, and without any faithfulnesse:
so that he could not bethinke himselfe of any man (how wicked soeuer he
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
was) in whom he might repose trust to meete with their lewdnesse. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a long while examined his thoughts vpon this point, at last hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
one master <hi>Chappelet du Prat,</hi> who ofttimes had resorted to his
house in <hi>Paris.</hi> And because he was a man of little stature, yet handsom
enough, the French not knowing what this word <hi>Chappelet</hi> might mean,
esteeming he should be called rather (in their tongue) <hi>Chappell;</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that in regard of his small stature, they termed him <hi>Chappelet,</hi> and
not <hi>Chappell,</hi> and so by the name of <hi>Chappelet</hi> he was euery where known,
and by few or none acknowledged for <hi>Chappel.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>This master <hi>Chappelet,</hi> was of so good and commendable life; that,
being a Notarie, he held it in high disdaine, that any of his Contractes
(although he made but few) should be found without falshoode. And
looke how many soeuer hee dealt withall, he would be vrged and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thereto, offering them his paines and trauaile for nothing, but to be
requited otherwise then by money; which prooued to bee his much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
recompencing, and returned to him the farre greater benefit. Hee
tooke the onely pleasure of the world, to beare false witnesse, if hee were
thereto entreated, and (oftentimes) when hee was not requested at all.
Likewise, because in those times, great trust and beleefe was giuen to an
oath, he making no care or conscience to be periured: greatly aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himselfe by Law suites, in regard that many matters relyed vpon his
oath, and deliuering the truth according to his knowledge.</p>
      <p>He delighted (beyond measure) and addicted his best studies, to cause
enmities &amp; scandals between kindred and friends, or any other persons,
agreeing well together; and the more mischiefe he could procure in this
kind, so much the more pleasure and delight tooke he therein. If he were
called to kil any one, or to do any other villanous deede, he neuer would
make deniall, but go to it very willingly; and diuers times it was wel kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
that many were cruelly beaten, ye slainc by his hands. Hee was a
most horrible blasphemer of God and his Saints, vpon the very least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
as being more addicted to choller, then any other man could be.
Neuer would he frequent the Church, but basely contemned it, with the
Sacraments and religious rites therein administred, accounting them for
vile and vnprofitable things: but very voluntarily would visit Tauernes,
and other places of dishonest accesse, which were continually pleasing
vnto him, to satisfie his lust and inordinate lubricitie. Hee would steale
both in publike and priuate, euen with such a conscience, as if it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to him by nature so to do. He was a great glutton and a drunkarde,
euen till he was not able to take any more: being also a continuall game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and carrier of false Dice, to cheate with them the verie best Friendes
he had.</p>
      <p>But why do I waste time in such extent of words? When it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to say, that neuer was there a worse man borne; whose wickednesse
was for long time supported, by the fauour, power, and Authoritie
of Monsieur <hi>Musciatto,</hi> for whose s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ke many wrongs and iniuries were
patiently endured, as well by priuate persons (whom hee would abuse
<pb facs="16"/>
notoriously) as others of the Court, beeweene whom he made no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all in his vile dealing. This Master <hi>Chappelet,</hi> being thus remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by <hi>Musciatto</hi> (who very well knew his life and behauiour) he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded himselfe, that this was a man apt in all respects, to meete
with the treachery of the Burgundians: whereupon, hauing sent for him,
thus he beganne.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Chappelet,</hi> thou knowest how I am wholly to retreate my selfe from
hence, and hauing some affaires among the Burgundians, men full of
wickednesse and deceite; I can bethinke my selfe of no meeter a man then
<hi>Chappelet,</hi> to recouer such debts as are due to me among them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it falleth out so well, that thou art not now hindered by any other
businesse; if thou wilt vndergoe this office for me, I will procure thee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
Letters from the Court, and giue thee a reasonable portion in
all thou recouerest. Master <hi>Chappelet,</hi> seeing himselfe idle, and greedy
after worldly goods, considering that <hi>Mounsieur Musciatto</hi> (who had
beene alwayes his best buckler) was now to depart from thence, without
any dreaming on the matter, and constrained thereto (as it were) by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
set downe his resolution, and answered that hee would gladly
doe it.</p>
      <p>Hauing made their agreement together, and receiued from <hi>Musciatto</hi>
his expresse procuration, as also the Kings gracious Letters; after that
<hi>Musciatto</hi> was gone on his iourney,<note place="margin">To Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogna saith the Italian.</note> Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> went to <hi>Dijon,</hi> where
he was vnknowne (well neere) of any. And there (quite from his naturall
disposition) he beganne benignely and graciously, in recouering the debts
due; which course he tooke the rather, because they should haue a further
feeling of him in the ende. Being lodged in the house of two Florentine
brethren, that liued on their monies vsance; and (for <hi>Mounsieur Musciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi>
sake) vsing him with honour and respect: It fortuned that he fell sicke,
and the two brethren sent for Physicions to attend him, allowing their
seruants to be diligent about him, making no spare of any thing, which
gaue the best likelyhood of restoring his health. But all their paines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to no purpose, because he (honest man) being now growne aged, and
hauing liued all his life time very disordredly, fell day by day (according
to the Physicions iudgement) from bad to worse, as no other way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
but death, whereat the brethren greatly greeued.</p>
      <p>Vpon a day, neere to the Chamber where the sicke man lay, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into this communication. What shall we doe (quoth the one to the
other) with this man? We are much hindered by him; for to send him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(sicke as he is) we shall be greatly blamed thereby, and it will be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
note of our weake wisedome: the people knowing that first of all
we gaue him entertainement, and haue allowed him honest physical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
and he not hauing any way iniuried or offended vs, to let him
be suddenly expulsed our house (sicke to death as he is) it can be no way
for our credit.</p>
      <p>On the other side, we are to consider also, that he hath bin so badde a
man, as he will not now make any confession thereof, neither receiue the
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
blessed Sacrament of the Church, and dying so without confession;
there is no Church that wil accept his body, but it must be buried in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
ground, like to a Dogge. And yet if he would confesse himselfe,
his sinnes are so many and monstrous; as the like case also may happen,
because there is not any Priest or Religious person, that can or will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
him. And being not absolued, he must be cast into some ditch or
pit, and then the people of the Towne, as well in regard of the account
we carry heere, (which to them appeareth so little pleasing, as we are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pursued with their worst words) as also coueting our spoile and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;
vpon this accident will cry out and mutiny against vs; <hi>Beholde
these Lombard dogs, which are not to be receiued into the Church, why should
we suffer them to liue heere among vs?</hi> In furious madnesse wil they come
vpon vs, and our house, where (peraduenture) not contented with rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
vs of our goods, our liues will remaine in their mercy and danger;
so that, in what sort soeuer it happen, this mans dying heere, must needs
be banefull to vs.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Chappelet,</hi> who (as we haue formerly saide) was lodged neere to
the place where they thus conferred, hauing a subtle attention (as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we see sicke persons to bee possessed withall) heard all these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
spoken of him, and causing them to be called vnto him, thus hee
spake.</p>
      <p>I would not haue you to be any way doubtfull of me; neither that you
shold receiue the least damage by me: I haue heard what you haue said,
and am certaine, that it will happen according to your words, if matters
should fall out as you conceite; but I am minded to deale otherwise. I
haue committed so many offences against our Lord God, in the vvhole
current of my life; that now I intend one action at the hour of my death,
which I trust will make amends for all. Procure therefore, I pray you,
that the most holy and religious man that is to be found (if there bee any
one at all) may come vnto me, and referre the case then to me, for I will
deale in such sort for you and my selfe, that all shall be well, and you no
way discontented.</p>
      <p>The two Brethren, although they had no great hope in his speeches,
went yet to a Monastery of Gray-Friars, and requested; that some one
holy and learned man, might come to heare the confession of a <hi>Lombard,</hi>
that lay verie weake and sicke in their house. And one was granted vnto
them, beeing an aged religious Frier, a great read master in the sacred
Scriptures, a very venerable person, who beeing of good and sanctified
life, all the Citizens held him in great respect &amp; esteem, and on he went
with thē to their house. When he was come vp into the Chamber wher
Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> lay, and being there seated downe by him; he beganne
first to comfort him very louingly, demanding also of him, howe many
times he had bin at confession? Whereto master <hi>Chappelet</hi> (who neuer
had bin shriuen in all his life time) thus replied.</p>
      <p>Holy Father, I alwayes vsed (as a common custome) to bee confessed
once (at the least) euery weeke, albeit sometimes much more often) but
<pb facs="17"/>
true it is, that being faln into this sicknesse, now eight dayes since; I haue
not bene confest, so violent hath bene the extremity of my weaknesse.
My sonne (answered the good old man) thou hast done well, and so keep
thee still hereafter in that minde: but I plainly perceiue, seeing thou hast
so often confessed thy selfe, that I shall take the lesse labour in vrging
questions to thee.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> replied: Say not so good Father, for albeit I haue
bene so oftentimes confessed, yet am I willing now to make a generall
confession, euen of all sinnes comming to my remembrance, from the
very day of my birth, vntil this instant houre of my shrift. And therefore
I intreate you (holy Father) to make a particular demand of euery thing,
euen as if I had neuer bene confessed at al, and to make no respect of my
sicknesse: for I had rather be offensiue to mine owne flesh, then by fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or allowing it ease, to hazard the perdition of my soule, which my
Redeemer bought with so precious a price.</p>
      <p>These words were highly pleasing to the holy Frier, and seemed to
him as an argument of a good conscience: Wherefore, after hee had
much commended this forwardnesse in him, he began to demand of him
if he had neuer offended with any Woman? Whereunto master <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelet</hi>
(breathing foorth a great sigh) answered.</p>
      <p>Holy Father, I am halfe ashamed to tell you the truth in this case, as
fearing least I should sinne in vaine-glory. Whereto the Confessor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
Speake boldly Sonne, and feare not; for in telling the truth, be it
in confession or otherwise, a man can neuer sinne. Then sayde Maister
<hi>Chappelet,</hi> Father, seeing you giue me so good an assurance, I wil resolue
you faithfully heerein. I am so true a Virgin-man in this matter, euen as
when I issued forth of my Mothers wombe. O Sonne (quoth the Frier)
how happie and blessed of God art thou? Well hast thou liued, and
therein hast not meanly merited: hauing hadde so much libertie to doo
the contrary if thou wouldst, wherein very few of vs can so answer for our
selues.</p>
      <p>Afterward, he demanded of him, how much displeasing to God hee
had beene in the sinne of Gluttony? When (sighing againe greatly) he
answered: Too much, and too often, good Father. For, ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Fasts of our Lent season, which euerie yeare ought to bee dulie
obserued by deuout people, I brought my selfe to such a customarie vse,
that I could fast three dayes in euery Weeke, with Bread and Water.
But indeede (holy Father) I confesse, that I haue drunke water with such
a pleasing appetite and delight (especially in praying, or walking on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages)
euen as greedy drunkards do, in drinking good Wine. And
many times I haue desired such Sallades of small hearbes, as Women
gather abroad in the open fields, and feeding onely vpon them, without
coueting after any other kinde of sustenance; hath seemed much more
pleasing to me, then I thought to agree with the nature of Fasting, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
when as it swerueth from deuotion, or is not done as it ought to
bee.</p>
      <p>
         <pb n="11" facs="17"/>
Sonne, Sonne, replied the Confessour, these sinnes are naturall, and
very light, and therefore I would not haue thee to charge thy conscience
with them, more then is needfull. It happeneth to euery man (how holy
soeuer he be) that after he hath fasted ouer-long, feeding will be welcome
to him, and drinking good drinke after his trauaile. O Sir (said Maister
<hi>Chappelet</hi>) neuer tell me this to comfort me, for well you know, and I am
not ignorant therein, that such things as are done for the seruice of God,
ought all to be performed purely, and without any blemish of the minde;
what otherwise is done, sauoureth of sinne. The Friar being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with his words, said: It is not amisse that thou vnderstandest it in
this manner, and thy conscience thus purely cleared, is no little comfort
to me. But tell me now concerning Auarice, hast thou sinned therein?
by desiring more then was reasonable, or withholding from others, such
things as thou oughtst not to detaine? whereto Maister <hi>Chappelet</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Good Father, I would not haue you to imagine, because you see
me lodged here in the house of two vsurers, that therefore I am of any
such disposition. No truly Sir, I came hither to no other end, but onely
to chastise and admonish them in friendly manner, to cleanse their mindes
from such abhominable profit: And assuredly, I should haue preuailed
therein, had not this violently sicknesse hindered mine intention. But
vnderstand (holy Father) that my parents left me a rich man, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
after my fathers death, the greater part of his goods I gaue away
for Gods sake, and then, to sustaine mine ownelife, and to helpe the poore
members of Iesus Christ, I betooke my selfe to a meane estate of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,
desiring none other then honest gaine thereby, and euermore
whatsoeuer benefit came to me; I imparted halfe thereof to the poore,
conuerting mine owne small portion about my necessary affaires, which
that other part would scarsely serue to supply: yet alwayes God gaue
thereto such a mercifull blessing, that my businesse dayly thriued more
and more, arising still from good to better.</p>
      <p>Well hast thou done therein good Sonne, said the Confessour: but
how often times hast thou beene angry? Oh Sir (said Maister <hi>Chappelet</hi>)
therein I assure yee, I haue often transgressed. And what man is able to
forbeare it, beholding the dayly actions of men to be so dishonest? No
care of keeping Gods commaundements, nor any feare of his dreadfull
iudgements. Many times in a day, I haue rather wished my selfe dead
then liuing, beholding youth pursuing idle vanities, to sweare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
themselues, tipling in Tauernes, and neuer haunting Churches;
but rather affecting the worlds follies, then any such duties as they owe
to God. Alas Sonne (quoth the Friar) this is a good and holy anger, and
I can impose no penance on thee for it. But tell me, hath not rage or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
at any time so ouer-ruled thee, as to commit murther or manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or to speake euill of any man, or to doe any other such kinde of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
Oh Father (answered Maister <hi>Chappelet</hi>) you that seeme to be a man
of God, how dare you vse any such vile words? If I had had the very least
thought, to doe any such act as you speake, doe you thinke that God
<pb facs="18"/>
would haue suffered me to liue? These are deedes of darknesse, fit for vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
and wicked liuers, of which hellish crue, when at any time I haue
happened to meete with some one of them; I haue said, Goe, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
thee.</p>
      <p>Worthy, and charitable words, replied the Friar; but tell me Sonne,
Didst thou euer beare false witnesse against any man, or hast spoken falsly,
or taken ought from any one, contrary to the will of the owner? Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
Father, said Maister <hi>Chappelet,</hi> I haue spoken ill of another, because
I haue sometime seene one of my neighbours, who with no meane shame
of the world, would doe nothing else but beate his wife: and of him once
I complained to the poore mans parents, saying, that he neuer did it, but
when he was ouercome with drinke. Those were no ill words, quoth the
Friar; but I remember, you said that you were a Merchant: Did you euer
deceiue any, as some Merchants vse to doe? Truly Father, answered
Maister <hi>Chappelet,</hi> I thinke not any, except one man, who one day brought
me money which he owed me, for a certaine piece of cloath I solde him,
and I put it into a purse without accounting it: about a moneth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I found that there were foure small pence more then was due to
me. And neuer happening to meete with the man againe, after I had
kept them the space of a whole yeare, I then gaue them away to foure
poore people for Gods sake.</p>
      <p>A small matter, said the Friar, &amp; truly payed back again to the owner,
in bestowing them vpon the poore. Many other questions hee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him, whereto still he answered in the same manner: but before he
proceeded to absolution, Maister <hi>Chappelet</hi> spake thus. I haue yet one
sinne more, which I haue not reuealed to you: when being vrged by the
Friar to confesse it, he said. I remember, that I should afford one day in
the weeke, to cleanse the house of my soule, for better entertainement
to my Lord and Sauiour, and yet I haue done no such reuerence to the
Sunday or Sabaoth, as I ought to haue done. A small fault Sonne,
replied the Friar. O no (quoth Maister <hi>Chappelet</hi>) doe not terme it a small
fault, because Sunday being a holy day, is highly to be reuerenced: for,
as on that day, our blessed Lord arose from death to life. But (quoth the
Confessour) hast thou done nothing else on that day? Yes, said he, being
forgetfull of my selfe, once I did spet in Gods Church. The Friar smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
said: Alas Sonne, that is a matter of no moment, for wee that are
Religious persons, doe vse to spet there euery day. The more is your
shame, answered Maister <hi>Chappelet,</hi> for no place ought to be kept more
pure and cleane then the sacred Temple, wherein our dayly sacrifices are
offered vp to God,</p>
      <p>In this manner he held on an houre and more, vttering the like trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
as these; and at last began to sigh very passionately, and to shed
a few teares, as one that was skilfull enough in such dissembling prankes;
whereat the Confessour being much mooued, said: Alas Sonne, what
aylest thou? Oh Father (quoth <hi>Chappelet</hi>) there remaineth yet one sinne
more vpon my conscience, whereof I neuer at any time made confession,
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
so shamefull it appeareth to me to disclose it; and I am partly perswaded,
that God will neuer pardon me for that sinne. How now Sonne? said the
Friar, neuer say so; for if all the sinnes that euer were committed by men,
or shall be committed so long as the World endureth, were onely in one
man, and he repenting them, and being so contrite for them, as I see thou
art; the grace and mercy of God is so great, that vpon penitent confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he will freely pardon him, and therefore spare not to speak it boldly.
Alas Father (said <hi>Chappelet,</hi> still in pretended weeping) this sinne of mine
is so great, that I can hardly beleeue (if your earnest prayers doe not assist
me) that euer I shall obtaine remission for it. Speake it Sonne, said the
Friar, and feare not, I promise that I will pray to God for thee.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> still wept and sighed, and continued silent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Confessors comfortable perswasions; but after hee had
helde him a long while in suspence, breathing forth a sighe, euen as if his
very heart would haue broken, he saide; Holy Father, seeing you promise
to pray to God for me, I will reueale it to you: Know then, that when I
was a little boy, I did once curse my Mother; which he had no sooner spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but he wrung his hands, and greeued extraordinarily. Oh good Son,
saide the Friar, doth that seeme so great a sinne to thee? Why, men doe
daily blaspheme our Lord God, and yet neuerthelesse, vpon their hearty
repentance, he is alwayes ready to forgiue them; and wilt not thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
to obtaine remission, for a sinne so ignorantly committed? Weepe
no more deare Sonne, but comfort thy selfe, and rest resolued, that if thou
wert one of them, who nayled our blessed Sauiour to his Crosse; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so truly repentant, as I see thou art, he would freely forgiue thee. Say
you so Father? quoth <hi>Chappelet.</hi> What? mine owne deare Mother? that
bare me in her wombe nine moneths, day and night, and afterwards fed
me with her breasts a thousand times, can I be pardoned for cursing her?
Oh no, it is too haynous a sinne, and except you pray to God very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
for me, he will not forgiue me.</p>
      <p>When the religious man perceiued, that nothing more was to be
confessed by Master <hi>Chappelet;</hi> he gaue him absolution, and his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
beside, reputing him to be a most holy man, as verily beleeuing
all that he had said. And who would not haue done the like, hearing
a man to speake in that manner, and being vpon the very point of death?
Afterward, he saide vnto him; Master <hi>Chappelet,</hi> by Gods grace you may
be soone restored to health, but if it so come to passe, that God doe take
your blessed and well disposed soule to his mercy, will it please you to
haue your body buried in our Conuent? Whereto Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
I thanke you Father for your good motion, and sorry should I
be, if my friends did bury me any where else, because you haue promised,
to pray to God for me; and beside, I haue alwayes carried a religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
to your Order. Wherefore, I beseech you, so soone as you are
come home to your Conuent, preuaile so much by your good meanes,
that the holy Eucharist, consecrated this morning on your high Altar,
may be brought vnto me: for although I confesse my selfe vtterly vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,

yet I purpose (by your reuerend permission) to receiue it, as also
your holy and latest vnction; to this ende, that hauing liued a greeuous
sinner, I may yet (at the last) die a Christian. These words were pleasing
to the good olde man, and he caused euery thing to be performed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> had requested.</p>
      <p>The two Brethren, who much doubted the dissembling of <hi>Chappelet,</hi>
being both in a small partition, which sundered the sicke mans Chamber
from theirs, heard and vnderstood the passage of all, betweene him and
the ghostly Father, being many times scarcely able to refrain from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
at the fraudulent course of his confession. And often they said with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
themselues; what manner of man is this, whom neither age, sicknesse,
nor terror of death so neere approaching, and sensible to his owne soule,
nor that which is much more, God, before whose iudgement he knowes
not how soone he shall appeare, or else be sent to a more fearefull place;
none of these can alter his wicked disposition, but that he will needes die
according as he hath liued? Notwithstanding, seeing he had so ordered
the matter, that he had burial freely allowed him, they cared for no more.</p>
      <p>After that <hi>Chappelet</hi> had receiued the Communion, and the other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
appointed for him; weaknesse encreasing on him more and
more, the very same day of his goodly confession, he died (not long after)
towards the euening. Whereupon the two Brethren tooke order, that
all needefull things should be in a readinesse, to haue him buried honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably;
sending to acquaint the Fathers of the Conuent therewith, that
they might come to say their <hi>Nigilles,</hi> according to precedent custome,
and then on the morrow to fetch the body. The honest Friar that had
confessed him, hearing he was dead, went to the Prior of the Conuent,
and by sound of the house Bell, caused all the Brethren to assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
giuing them credibly to vnderstand, that Master <hi>Chappelet</hi> was a very
holy man, as appeared by all the parts of his confession, and made no
doubt, but that many miracles would be wrought by his sanctified body,
perswading them to fetch it thither with all deuoute solemnity and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
whereto the Prior, and all the credulous Brethren presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended
very gladly.</p>
      <p>When night was come, they went all to visit the dead body of Master
<hi>Chappelet,</hi> where they vsed an especiall and solemne <hi>Nigill;</hi> and on the
morrow, apparrelled in their richest Coapes and Vestiments, with books
in their hands, and the Crosse borne before them, singing in the forme
of a very deuoute procession, they brought the body pompeously into
their Church, accompanied with all the people of the Towne, both men
and women. The Father Confessor, ascending vp into the Pulpit, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
wonderfull things of him, and the rare holinesse of his life; his fastes,
his virginity, simplicity, innocency, and true sanctity, recounting also
(among other especiall obseruations) what <hi>Chappelet</hi> had confessed, as
this most great and greeuous sinne, and how hardly he could be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that God would grant him pardon for it. Wherby he tooke occasion
to reproue the people then present, saying; And you (accursed of God) for
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
verie least and trifling matter hapning, will not spare to blaspheme God,
his blessed Mother, and the whole Court of heauenly Paradise: Oh, take
example by this singular man, this Saint-like man, nay, a verie Saint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
      <p>Many additions more he made, concerning his faithfulnesse, truth, &amp;
integrity; so that, by the vehement asseueration of his words (wherto all
the people there present gaue credible beleefe) he prouoked them vnto
such zeale and earnest deuotion; that the Sermon was no sooner ended,
but (in mighty crowds and throngs) they pressed about the Biere, kissing
his hands and feete, and all the garments about him were torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as precious Reliques of so holy a person, and happy they thought
themselues, that could get the smallest peece or shred of anie thing that
came neere to his body, and thus they continued all the day, the body ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still open, to be visited in this manner.</p>
      <p>When night was come, they buried him in a goodly Marble tombe,
erected in a faire Chappell purposely; and for many dayes after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was most strange to see, how the people of the country came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on heapes, with holy Candles and other offerings, with Images of
waxe fastened to the Tombe, in signe of Sacred and solemne Vowes, to
this new created Saint. And so farre was spread the fame and renowne
of his sanctity, deuotion, and integrity of life, maintained constantly by
the Fathers of the Conuent; that if any one fell sicke in neede, distresse,
or aduersity, they would make their Vowes to no other Saint but him:
naming him (as yet to this day they do) Saint <hi>Chappelet,</hi> affirming vpon
their Oathes, that infinite miracles were there daily performed by him,
and especially on such, as came in deuotion to visit his shrine.</p>
      <p>In this manner liued and died Master <hi>Chappelet du Prat,</hi> who before he
became a Saint, was as you haue heard: and I will not deny it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but that he may be at rest among other blessed bodies. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he liued lewdly and wickedly, yet such might be his contrition in
the latest extreamity, that (questionlesse) he might finde mercie. But,
because such things remaine vnknowne to vs, and speaking by outwarde
appearance, vulgar iudgement will censure otherwise of him, and thinke
him to be rather in perdition, then in so blessed a place as Paradice. But
referring that to the Omnipotent appointment, whose clemencie hath
alwayes beene so great to vs, that he regards not our errors, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of our Faith, making (by meanes of our continuall Mediator) of

name, so will I conclude, desiring that it may euermore be had in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
and referre we our selues thereto in all our necessities, with this
setled assurance, that he is alwayes readie to heare vs. And so he ceased.</p>

         <hi>Pamphilus</hi> hath declared to vs by his Tale, how the goodnesse of God
regardeth not our errors, when they proceede from things which vvee
cannot discerne. And I intend to approoue by mine, what argument of
infallible truth, the same benignity deliuereth of it selfe, by enduring pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
the faults of them, that (both in word and worke) should declare
vnfaigned testimony of such gracious goodnesse, and not to liue so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
as they doe. To the end, that others illumined by their light of
life, may beleeue with the stronger constancy of minde.</p>
      <p>As I haue heeretofore heard (Gracious Ladies) there liued a wealthy
Marchant in <hi>Paris,</hi> being a Mercer, or seller of Silkes, named <hi>Iehannot de
<pb n="14" facs="20"/>
Cheuigny,</hi> a man of faithful, honest, and vpright dealing; who held great
affection and friendship with a very rich Iew, named <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was
a Merchant also, and a man of very direct conuersation. <hi>Iehannot</hi> vvell
noting the honesty and loyall dealing of this Iew, began to haue a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
kind of compassion in his soule, much pittying, that a man so good
in behauiour, so wise and discreete in all his actions, should be in danger
of perdition thorow want of Faith. In which regard, louingly he began
to entreate him, that he would leaue the errors of his Iewish beleefe, and
follow the truth of Christianity, which he euidently saw (as being good
and holy) daily to prosper and enlarge it selfe, whereas (on the contrary)
his profession decreased, and grew to nothing.</p>
      <p>The Iew made answer, that he beleeued nothing to be so good &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the Iewish Religion, and hauing beene borne therein, therein also
he purposed to liue and dye, no matter whatsoeuer, being able to remoue
him from that resolution. For all this stiffe deniall, <hi>Iehannot</hi> would not
so giue him ouer; but pursued him still day by day, reitterating continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
his former speeches to him: deliuering infinite excellent and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
reasons, that Merchants themselues were not ignorant, how farre
the Christian faith excelled the Iewish falshoods. And albeit the Iew
was a very learned man in his owne law, yet notwithstanding, the intire
amity hee bare to <hi>Iehannot,</hi> or (perhaps) his words fortified by the blessed
Spirit, were so preualent with him: that the Iew felt a pleasing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in them, though his obstinacie stood (as yet) farre off from conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But as hee thus continued strong in opinion, so <hi>Iehannot</hi> left not
hourely to labour him: in so much that the Iew, being conquered by
such earnest and continuall importunity, one day spake to <hi>Iehannot</hi>
thus.</p>
      <p>My worthy friend <hi>Iehannot,</hi> thou art extremely desirous, that I should
conuert to Christianity, and I am well contended to doe it, onely vpon
this condition. That first I will iourney to Rome, to see him (whom thou
sayest) is Gods generall vicar here on earth, and to consider on the course
of his life and manners, and likewise of his Colledge of Cardinals. If he
and they doe appeare such men to me, as thy speeches affirmes them to
be, and thereby I may comprehend, that thy faith and Religion is better
then mine, as (with no meane paines) thou endeuourest to perswade me:
I will become a Christian as thou art, but if I finde it otherwise, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Iew as I am.</p>
      <p>When <hi>Iehannot</hi> heard these words, he became exceeding sorrowfull,
within himselfe. I haue lost all the paines, which I did thinke to be well
imployed, as hoping to haue this man conuerted here: For, if he goe to
the Court of Rome, and behold there the wickednes of the Priests liues;
farewell all hope in me, of euer seeing him to become a Christian. But
rather, were he already a Christian, without all question, he would turne
Iew: And so (going neerer to <hi>Abraham</hi>) he said. Alas my louing friend,
why shouldst thou vndertake such a tedious trauell, and so great a charge,
as thy iourney from hence to Rome will cost thee? Consider, that to a
<pb facs="21"/>
rich man (as thou art) trauaile by land or sea is full of infinite dangers.
Doest thou not thinke, that here are Religious men enow, who will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bestowe Baptisme vpon thee. To me therefore it plainely appeareth,
that such a voyage is to no purpose. If thou standest vpon any doubt or
scruple, concerning the faith whereto I wish thee; where canst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
conference with greater Doctours, or men more learned in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
then this famous Citie doth affoord thee, to resolue thee in any
questionable case? Thou must thinke, that the Prelates are such there, as
here thou seest them to be, and yet they must needes be in much better
condition at Rome, because they are neere to the principall Pastour. And
therefore, if thou wilt credit my counsell, reserue this iourney to some
time more conuenient, when the Iubilee of generall pardon happeneth,
and then (perchance) I will beare thee company, and goe along with thee
as in vowed pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>Whereto the Iew replied. I beleeue <hi>Iehannot,</hi> that all which thou hast
said may be so. But, to make short with thee, I am fully determined (if
thou wouldst haue me a Christian, as thou instantly vrgest me to be) to
goe thither, for otherwise, I will continue as I am. <hi>Iehannot</hi> perceiuing
his setled purpose, said: Goe then in Gods name. But perswaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that hee would neuer become a Christian, after hee had once seene
the Court of Rome: neuerthelesse, he counted his labour not altogether
lost, in regard he bestowed it to a good end, and honest intentions are to
be commended.</p>
      <p>The Iew mounted on horse-backe, and made no lingering in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Rome, where being arriued, he was very honourably entertained
by other Iewes dwelling in Rome. And during the time of his abiding
there (without reuealing to any one, the reason of his comming thither)
very heedfully he obserued, the manner of the Popes life, of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Prelates, and all the Courtiers. And being a man very discreete and
iudicious, he apparantly perceiued, both by his owne eye, and further
information of friends; that from the highest to the lowest (without any
restraint, remorse of conscience, shame, or feare of punishment) all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in abhominable luxurie, and not naturally onely, but in foule Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
so that the credit of Strumpets and Boyes was not small, and yet
might be too easily obtained. Moreouer, drunkards, belly-Gods, and
seruants of the paunch, more then of any thing else (euen like brutish
beasts after their luxurie) were euery where to be met withall. And, vpon
further obseruation, hee saw all men so couetous and greedy of coyne,
that euery thing was bought and solde for ready money, not onely the
blood of men, but (in plaine termes) the faith of Christians, yea, and
matters of diuinest qualities, how, or to whomsoeuer appertaining, were
it for sacrifices or benefices, whereof was made no meane Merchandize,
and more Brokers were there to be found (then in <hi>Paris</hi> attending vpon
all Trades) of manifest Symonie, vnder the nice name of Negotiation,
and for gluttony, not sustentation: euen as if God had not knowne the
signification of vocables, nor the intentions of wicked hearts, but would
<pb n="15" facs="21"/>
suffer himselfe to be deceiued by the outward names of things, as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
men commonly vse to doe.</p>
      <p>These things, and many more (fitter for silence, then publication)
were so deepely displeasing to the Iew, being a most sober and modest
man; that he had soone seene enough, resoluing on his returne to <hi>Paris,</hi>
which very speedily he performed. And when <hi>Iehannot</hi> heard of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall,
crediting much rather other newes from him, then euer to see him
a conuerted Christian; he went to welcome him, and kindly they feasted
one another. After some fewe dayes of resting, <hi>Iehannot</hi> demaunded of
him; what he thought of our holy father the Pope and his Cardinals, and
generally of all the other Courtiers? Whereto the Iew readily answered;
It is strange <hi>Iehannot,</hi> that God should giue them so much as he doth. For
I will truly tell thee, that if I had beene able to consider all those things,
which there I haue both heard and seene: I could then haue resolued my
selfe, neuer to haue found in any Priest, either sanctity, deuotion, good
worke, example of honest life, or any good thing else beside. But if a
man desire to see luxury, auarice, gluttony, and such wicked things, yea,
worse, if worse may be, and held in generall estimation of all men; let
him but goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> which I thinke rather to be the forge of damnable
actions, then any way leaning to grace or goodnesse. And, for ought I
could perceiue, me thinkes your chiefe Pastour, and (consequently) all the
rest of his dependants, doe striue so much as they may (with all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
arte and endeuour) to bring to nothing, or else to banish quite out
of the world, Christian Religion, whereof they should be the support and
foundation.</p>
      <p>But because I perceiue, that their wicked intent will neuer come to
passe, but contrariwise, that your faith enlargeth it selfe, shining euery
day much more cleare and splendant: I gather thereby euidently, that
the blessed Spirit is the true ground and defence thereof, as being more
true and holy then any other. In which respect, whereas I stood stiffe and
obstinate against the good admonitions, and neuer minded to become a
Christian: now I freely open my heart vnto thee, that nothing in the
world can or shall hinder me, but I will be a Christian, as thou art. Let
vs therefore presently goe to the Church, and there (according to the
true custome of your holy faith) helpe me to be baptized.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Iehannot,</hi> who expected a farre contrary conclusion, then this, hearing
him speake it with such constancy; was the very gladdest man in the
world, and went with him to the Church of <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he requested the Priests there abiding, to bestow baptisme on <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which they ioyfully did, hearing him so earnestly to desire it. <hi>Iehannot</hi>
was his Godfather, and named him <hi>Iobn,</hi> and afterward, by learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
he was more fully instructed in the grounds of our faith; wherein
he grew of greatly vnderstanding, and led a very vertuous life.</p>

ouer Kings of the Sarrazens, and of Christians likewise. Hauing

all his treasure, and (by reason of some sodaine accident happening
to him) standing in neede to vse some great summe of money, yet not

named <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> that lent out money to vse or interest in the City of
<hi>Alexandria.</hi> This man he imagined best able to furnish him, if he could
be won to do it willingly: but he was knowne to be so gripple and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that hardly any meanes would drawe him to it. In the end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by necessity, and labouring his wits for some apt deuice whereby
he might haue it: he concluded, though hee might not compell him to
do it, yet by a practise shadowed with good reason to ensnare him. And
hauing sent for him, entertained him very familiarly in his Court, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe by him, thus began.</p>
      <p>Honest man, I haue often heard it reported by many, that thou art ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
skilfull, and in cases concerning God, thou goest beyond all other of
these times: wherefore, I would gladly be informed by thee, vvhich of
those three Lawes or Religions, thou takest to be truest; that of the Iew,
the other of the Sarazen, or that of the Christian? The Iew, being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise man, plainly perceiued, that <hi>Saladine</hi> sought to entrap him in his
answer, and so to raise some quarrell against him. For, if he commended
any one of those Lawes aboue the other, he knew that <hi>Saladine</hi> had what
he aymed at. Wherefore, bethinking himselfe to shape such an answer,
as might no way trouble or entangle him: summoning all his sences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and considering, that dallying with the Soldane might redound
to his no meane danger, thus he replied.</p>
      <p>My Lord, the question propounded by you, is faire and worthy, &amp; to
answer mine opinion truly threof, doth necessarily require some time of
consideration, if it might stand with your liking to allow it: but if not, let
me first make entrance to my reply, with a pretty tale, and well worth the
hearing. I haue oftentimes heard it reported, that (long since) there was
a very wealthy man, who (among other precious Iewels of his owne) had
a goodly Ring of great valew; the beauty and estimation whereof, made
him earnestly desirous to leaue it as a perpetuall memory and honour to
his successors. Whereupon, he willed and ordained, that he among his
male children, with whom this Ring (being left by the Father) should be
found in custody after his death; hee and none other was to bee reputed
his heire, and to be honoured and reuerenced by all the rest, as being the
prime and worthiest person. That Sonne, to whom this Ring was left by
him, kept the same course to his posterity, dealing (in all respects) as his
predecessor had done; so that (in short time) the Ring (from hand to
hand) had many owners by Legacie.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="23"/>
At length, it came to the hand of one, who had three sonnes, all of
them goodly and vertuous persons, and verie obedient to their Father:
in which regard, he affected them all equally, without any difference or
partiall respect. The custome of this ring being knowne to them, each
one of them (coueting to beare esteeme aboue the other) desired (as hee
could best make his meanes) his father, that in regard he was now grown
very old, he would leaue that Ring to him, whereby he should bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for his heire. The good man, who loued no one of them
more then the other, knew not how to make his choise, nor to which of
them he should leaue the Ring: yet hauing past his promise to them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally,
he studied by what meanes to satisfie them all three. Wherfore,
secretly hauing conferred with a curious and excellent Goldsmith, hee
caused two other Rings to bee made, so really resembling the first made
Ring, that himself (when he had them in his hand) could not distinguish
which was the right one.</p>
      <p>Lying vpon his death-bed, and his Sonnes then plying him by their
best opportunities, he gaue to each of them a Ring And they (after his
death) presuming seuerally vpon their right to the inheritance &amp; honor,
grew to great contradiction and square: each man producing then his
Ring, which were so truly all alike in resemblance, as no one could know
the right Ring from the other. And therefore, suite in Law, to distinguish
the true heire to his Father; continued long time, and so it dooth yet to
this very day. In like manner my good Lord, concerning those three
Lawes giuen by God the Father, to three such people as you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:
each of them do imagine that they haue the heritage of God,
and his true Law, and also duely to performe his Commandements;
but which of them do so indeede, the question (as of the three Ringes) is
yet remaining.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Saladine</hi> well perceyuing, that the Iew was too cunning to be caught
in his snare, and had answered so well, that to doe him further violence,
would redound vnto his perpetuall dishonour; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

disclosed the matter, and how he purposed to haue dealt with him,
if he had not returned so wise an answer; the Iew lent him so great a sum
of money as hee demanded, and <hi>Saladine</hi> repayed it againe to him iustly,

      <p>Gracious Ladies, if I faile not in vnderstanding your generall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we are purposely assembled here to tell Tales, and especially such as
may please our selues. In whith respect, because nothing should be done
disorderly, I hold it lawfull for euery one (as our Queene decreed before
her dignity) to relate such a nouelty, as (in their owne iudgement) may
cause most contentment. Wherefore hauing heard, that by the good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of <hi>Iehannot de Cheuigny, Abraham</hi> the Iew was aduised to the
saluation of his soule, and <hi>Melchisedech</hi> (by his witty vnderstanding) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his riches from the traines of <hi>Saladine:</hi> I now purpose to tell you
in a few plaine words, (without feare of receiuing any reprehension) how
cunningly a Monke compassed his deliuerance, from a punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
towards him.</p>
      <p>There was in the Country of <hi>Lunigiana</hi> (which is not farre distant from
our owne) a Monastery, which sometime was better furnished with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb facs="24"/>
and Religion, then now adayes they are; wherein liued (among
diuers other) a young nouice Monke, whose hot and lusty disposition (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the vigour of his yeeres) was such, as neither fastes nor prayers had
any great power ouer him. It chanced on a fasting day about high noone,
when all the other Monkes were asleepe in their Dormitaries or Dorters,
this frolicke Friar was walking alone in their Church, which stood in a
very solitary place, where ruminating on many matters by himselfe, hee
espied a pretty hansome wench (some Husbandmans daughter in the
Countrey, that had beene gathering rootes and hearbes in the field) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
her knees before an Altar, whom he had no sooner seene, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hee felt effeminate temptations, and such as ill fitted with his
profession.</p>
      <p>Lasciuious desire, and no religious deuotion, made him draw neere
her, and whether vnder shift (the onely cloake to compasse carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
or some other as close conference, to as pernicious and vile a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I know not: but so farre he preuailed vpon her frailety, and such a
bargaine passed betweene them, that (from the Church) he wonne her to
his Chamber, before any person could perceiue it. Now, while this yong
lusty Monke (transported with ouer-fond affection) was more carelesse
of his dalliance, then he should haue beene; the Lord Abbot, being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arisen from sleepe, and walking softly about the Cloyster, came to the
Monkes Daughters doore, where hearing what noyse was made between
them, and a feminine voyce, more strange then hee was wont to heare;
he layed his eare close to the Chamber doore, and plainly perceiued, that
a woman was within. Wherewith being much moued, he intended sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to make him open the doore; but (vpon better consideration) hee
conceiued it farre more fitting for him, to returne backe to his owne
chamber, and tary vntill the Monke should come forth.</p>
      <p>The Monke, though his delight with the Damosel was extraordinary,
yet feare and suspition followed vpon it: for, in the very height of all his
wantonnesse, he heard a soft treading about the doore. And prying tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a small creuice in the same doore, perceiued apparantly, that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
himselfe stood listening there, and could not be ignorant, but that the
Maide was with him in the Chamber. As after pleasure ensueth paine,
so the veniall Monke knew well enough (though wanton heate would
not let him heede it before) that most greeuous punishment must be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on him; which made him sad beyond all measure. Neuerthelesse,
without disclosing his dismay to the young Maiden, he began to consider
with himselfe on many meanes, whereby to find out one that might best
fit his turne. And suddenly conceited an apt stratagem, which sorted to
such effect as he would haue it: whereupon seeming satisfied for that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
hee tolde the Damosell, that (being carefull of her credit) as he had
brought her in vnseen of any, so he would free her from thence again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
her to tarrie there (without making any noyse at all) vntil such time
as he returned to her.</p>
      <p>Going forth of the Chamber, and locking it fast with the key, he went
<pb n="18" facs="24"/>
directly to the Lord Abbots lodging, and deliuering him the saide key (as
euery Monke vsed to doe the like, when he went abroade out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent)
setting a good countenance on the matter, boldly saide; My Lord,
I haue not yet brought in all my par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> of the wood, which lieth ready cut
downe in the Forrest; and hauing now conuenient time to doe it, if you
please to giue me leaue, I will goe and fetch it. The Abbot perswading
himselfe, that he had not beene discouered by the Monke, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
more assuredly in the offence committed; being not a little iocund
of so happy an accident, gladly tooke the key, and gaue him leaue to fetch
the wood.</p>
      <p>No sooner was he gone, but the Abbot beganne to consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
what he were best to doe in this case, either (in the presence of all the
other Monkes) to open the Chamber doore, that so the offence being
knowne to them all, they might haue no occasion of murmuring against
him, when he proceeded in the Monkes punishment; or rather should first
vnderstand of the Damosell her selfe, how, and in what manner shee was
brought thither. Furthermore, he considered, that shee might be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of respect, or some such mans daughter, as would not take it well,
to haue her disgraced before all the Monkes. Wherefore he concluded,
first to see (himselfe) what shee was, and then (afterward) to resolue vpon
the rest. So going very softly to the Chamber, and entring in, locked the
doore fast with the key, when the poore Damosell thinking it had beene
the gallant young Monke; but finding it to be the Lord Abbot, shee fell
on her knees weeping, as fearing now to receiue publike shame, by being
betrayed in this vnkinde manner.</p>
      <p>My Lord Abbot looking demurely on the Maide, and perceiuing her
to be faire, feate, and louely; felt immediately (although he was olde) no
lesse spurring on to fleshly desires, then the young Monke before had
done; whereupon he beganne to conferre thus priuately with himselfe.
Why should I not take pleasure, when I may freely haue it? Cares and
molestations I endure euery day, but sildome find such delights prepared
for me. This is a delicate sweete young Damosell, and here is no eye that
can discouer me. If I can enduce her to doe as I would haue her, I know
no reason why I should gaine-say it. No man can know it, or any tongue
blaze it abroade; and sinne so concealed, is halfe pardoned. Such a faire
fortune as this is, perhaps hereafter will neuer befall me; and therefore I
hold it wisedome, to take such a benefit when a man may enioy it.</p>
      <p>Vpon this immodest meditation, and his purpose quite altered which
he came for; he went neerer to her, and very kindly began to comfort her,
desiring her to forbeare weeping, and (by further insinuating speeches)
acquainted her with his amorous intention. The Maide, who was made
neither of yron nor diamond, and seeking to preuent one shame by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was easily wonne to the Abbots will, which caused him to embrace
and kisse her often.</p>
      <p>Our lusty young nouice Monke, whom the Abbot imagined to be
gone for wood, had hid himselfe aloft vpon the roofe of the Dorter,
<pb facs="25"/>
where, when he saw the Abbot enter alone into the Chamber, hee lost a
great part of his former feare, promising to himselfe a kinde of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that somewhat would ensue to his better comfort; but when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him lockt into the Chamber, then his hope grew to vndoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
A little chincke or creuice fauoured him, whereat he could both
heare and see, whatsoeuer was done or spoken by them: so, when the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
thought hee had staide long enough with the Damosell, leauing her
still there, and locking the doore fast againe, hee returned thence to his
owne Chamber.</p>
      <p>Within some short while after, the Abbot knowing the Monke to be
in the Conuent, and supposing him to be lately returned with the wood,
determined to reproue him sharpely, and to haue him closely imprisoned,
that the Damosell might remaine solie to himselfe. And causing him to
be called presently before him, with a very stearne and angry countenance
giuing him many harsh and bitter speeches, commanded, that he should
be clapt in prison.</p>
      <p>The Monke very readily answered, saying. My good Lord, I haue not
yet beene so long in the order of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> as to learne all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities
thereto belonging. And beside Sir, you neuer shewed mee or
any of my brethren, in what manner we young Monkes ought to vse wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as you haue otherwise done for our custome of prayer and fasting.
But seeing you haue so lately therein instructed mee, and by your owne
example how to doe it: I heere solemnely promise you, if you please to
pardon me but this one error, I will neuer faile therein againe, but dayly
follow what I haue seene you doe.</p>
      <p>The Abbot, being a man of quicke apprehension, perceiued instantly
by this answere; that the Monke not onely knew as much as he did, but
also had seene (what was intended) that hee should not. Wherefore,
finding himselfe to be as faulty as the Monke, and that hee could not
shame him, but worthily had deserued as much himselfe; pardoning him,
and imposing silence on eithers offence: they conuayed the poore abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Damosell forth of their doores, she purposing (neuer after) to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
in the like manner.</p>

      <p>It is no little ioy to me, that wee vnderstand so well (by the discourses

(both in word and deede) should defend her honour in that kind,
when importunity laboureth to betray it.</p>
      <p>The Marquesse of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was a worthy and valiant Knight, who
being Captaine Generall for the Church, the necessary seruice required
his company on the Seas, in a goodly Army of the Christians against the
Turkes. Vpon a day, in the Court of King <hi>Philip,</hi> sirnamed the one eyed
King (who likewise made preparation in <hi>France,</hi> for a royall assistance to
that expedition) as many speeches were deliuered, concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and manhood of this Marquesse: it fortuned, that a Knight was
then present, who knew him very familiarly, and hee gaue an addition to
the former commendation, than the whole world contained not a more
equall couple in mariage, then the Marquesse &amp; his Lady. For, as among
all Knights, the Marquesse could hardly be paraleld for Armes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<pb facs="26"/>
euen so his wife, in comparison of all other Ladies, was scarcely
matchable for beauty and vertue. Which words were so waighty in the
apprehension of King <hi>Philip,</hi> that suddainly (hauing as yet neuer seene
her) he began to affect her very earnestly, concluding to embarque him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at <hi>Gennes</hi> or <hi>Genoua,</hi> there to set forward on the intended voyage,
and iourneying thither by land: hee would shape some honest excuse to
see the Lady Marquesse, whose Lord being then from home, opinion
perswaded him ouer-fondly, that he should easily obtaine the issue of his
amorous desire.</p>
      <p>When hee was come within a dayes iourney, where the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
then lay; he sent her word, that she should expect his company on
the morrow at dinner. The Lady, being singularly wise and iudicious;
answered the Messenger, that she reputed the Kings comming to her, as
an extraordinary grace and fauour, and that hee should be most heartily
welcome. Afterward, entring into further consideration with her selfe,
what the King might meane by this priuate visitation, knowing her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to be from home, and it to be no meane barre to his apter enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement:
at last she discreetly conceited (and therein was not deceiued)
that babling report of her beauty and perfections, might thus occasion
the Kings cōming thither, his iourny lying else a quite contrary way. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
being a Princely Lady, and so loyall a wife as euer liued,
shee intended to giue him her best entertainement: summoning the
chiefest Gentlemen in the Country together, to take due order (by their
aduise) for giuing the King a gracious welcome. But concerning the
dinner, and diet for seruice to his table; that remained onely at her owne
disposing.</p>
      <p>Sending presently abroade, and buying all the Hennes that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
afforded; shee commaunded her Cookes, that onely of them (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other prouision beside) they should prepare all the seruices that
they could deuise. On the morrow, the King came according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and was most honourable welcommed by the Lady, who seemed in
his eye (farre beyond the Knights speeches of her) the fairest creature that
euer he had seene before; whereat he meruailed not a little, extolling her
perfections to be peerelesse, which much the more enflamed his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and (almost) made his desires impatient. The King being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
into such Chambers, as orderly were prepared for him, and as
beseemed so great a Prince: the houre of dinner drawing on, the King
and the Lady Marquesse were seated at one Table, and his attendants
placed at other tables, answerable to their degrees of honour.</p>
      <p>Plenty of dishes being serued in, and the rarest wines that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
yeelded, the King had more minde to the faire Lady Marquesse, then
any meate that stood on the Table. Neuerthelesse, obseruing each ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
after other, and that all the Viands (though variously cooked, and in
diuers kindes) were nothing else but Hennes onely; he began to wonder,
and so much the rather, because he knew the Countrey to be of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that it affoorded all plenty both of Fowles and Venyson: beside, after
<pb n="20" facs="26"/>
the time of his comming was heard, they had respite enough, both for
hawking and hunting; and therefore it encreased his maruell the more,
that nothing was prouided for him, but Hennes onely: wherein to be the
better resolued, turning a merry countenance to the Lady, thus he spake.
Madam, are Hennes onely bred in this Countrey, and no Cockes? The
Lady Marquesse, very well vnderstanding his demand, which fitted her
with an apt opportunity, to thwart his idle hope, and defend her owne
honour; boldly returned the King this answere. Not so my Lord, but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and wiues, howsoeuer they differ in garments and graces one from
another; yet notwithstanding, they are all heere as they be in other
places.</p>
      <p>When the King heard this reply, he knew well enough the occasion of
his Henne dinner, as also, what vertue lay couched vnder her answer;
perceiuing apparantly, that wanton words would proue but in vaine, and
such a woman was not easily to be seduced; wherefore, as hee grew ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored
on her inconsiderately, so he found it best fitting for his honour,
to quench this heate with wisedome discreetely. And so, without any
more words, or further hope of speeding in so vnkingly a purpose, dinner
being ended, by a sudden departing, he smoothly shadowed the cause of
his comming, and thanking her for the honour shee had done him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her to her chaste disposition, and posted away with speede to

      <p>Not long since (worthy Ladies) there dwelt in our owne natiue City,
a Friar Minor, an Inquisitor after matters of Faith, who, although he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
greatly to seeme a sanctified man, and an earnest affecter of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, (as all of them appeare to be in outward shew;) yet he was
a much better Inquisitor after them, that had their purses plenteously sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with money, then of such as were slenderly grounded in Faith. By
which diligent continued care in him, he found out a man, more rich in
purse, then vnderstanding; and yet not so defectiue in matters of faith, as
misguided by his owne simple speaking, and (perhaps) when his braine
<pb facs="27"/>
was well warmed with wine, words fell more foolishly from him, then in
better iudgement they could haue done.</p>
      <figure>
</figure>
      <p>Being on a day in company, (very little differing in quality from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
he chanced to say; that he had beene at such good wine, as God
himselfe did neuer drinke better. Which words (by some Sicophant then
in presence) being carried to this curious Inquisitor, and he well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the mans faculties were great, and his bagges swolne vp full with
no meane abundance: <hi>Cum gladijs &amp; fustibus;</hi> With Booke, Bell, and
Candle, he raysed an hoast of execrations against him, and the Sumner
cited him with a solemne Processe to appeare before him, vnderstanding
sufficiently, that this course would sooner fetch money from him, then
amend any misbeliefe in the man; for no further reformation did he seeke
after.</p>
      <p>The man comming before him, he demanded, if the accusation inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
against him, was true or no? Whereto the honest man answered,
that he could not denie the speaking of such words, and declared in what
manner they were vttered. Presently the Inquisitor, most deuoutly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> with the golden beard, saide; What? Doest thou make
our Lord a drinker, and a curious quaffer of wines, as if he were a glutton,
belly-god, or a Tauerne haunter, as thou, and other drunkards are. Being
an hypocrite, as thou art, thou thinkest this to be but a light matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may seeme so in thine owne opinion: but I tell thee plainly, that
it deserueth fire and faggor, if I should proceede in Iustice to inflict it on
thee: with these, and other such like threatning words, as also a very stearn
and angry countenance, he made the man belieue himselfe to be an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and that hee denied the eternity of the soule; whereby he fell into
<pb n="21" facs="27"/>
such a trembling feare, as doubting indeed, least he should be burned,
that, to be more mercifully dealt withall, he rounded him in the care, and
(by secret means) so annointed his hands with Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> golden grease,
(a very singular remedy against the disease pestilentiall in couetous
Priests, especially Friars Minors, that dare touch no money) as the case
became very quickly altered.</p>
      <p>This soueraigne vnction was of such vertue (though <hi>Galen</hi> speakes not
a word thereof among all his chiefest medicines) and so farre preuailed;
that the terrible threatening words of fire and fagot, became meerely fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
vp, and gracious language blew a more gentle and calmer ayre; the
Inquisitor deliuering him an hallowed Crucifixe, creating him a Souldier
of the Crosse (because he had payred Crosses good store for it) and euen
as if he were to trauell vnder that Standard to the holy Land; so did hee
appoint him a home-paying pennance, namely, to visit him thrice euery
weeke in his Chamber, and to annoint his hands with the selfe-same yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vnguent, and afterward, to heare a Masse of the holy Crosse, visiting
him also at dinner time, which being ended, to doe nothing all the rest of
the day, but according as he directed him.</p>
      <p>The simple man, yet not so simple, but seeing that this weekely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Inquisitors hands, would (in time) graspe away all his gold; grew
weary of this annointing, and beganne to consider with himselfe, how to
stay the course of this chargeable penance: And comming one morning,
(according to his iniunction) to heare Masse, in the Gospell he obserued
these wordes; <hi>You shall receiue an hundred for one, and so possesse eternall
life;</hi> which saying he kept perfectly in his memory, and, as hee was
commanded, at dinner time, he came to the Inquisitor, finding him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his fellowes) seated at the Table. The Inquisitor presently deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him, whether he had heard Masse that morning, or no? Yes Sir,
replied the man very readily. Hast thou heard any thing therein (quoth
the Inquisitor) whereof thou art doubtfull, or desirest to be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?
Surely Sir, answered the plaine meaning man, I make no doubt
of any thing I haue heard, but doe beleeue all constantly; onely one thing
troubleth me much, and maketh me very compassionate of you, and of
all these holy Fathers your brethren, perceiuing in what wofull and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
estate you will be, when you shall come into another World. What
words are these, quoth the Inquisitor? And why art thou moued to such
compassion of vs? O good Sir, saide the man, doe you remember the
words in the Gospell this morning? you shall receiue an hundred for
one. That is very true, replied the Inquisitor, but what moueth thee to
vrge those words?</p>
      <p>I will tell you Sir, answered the plaine fellow, so it might please you to
be not offended. Since the time of my resorting hither, I haue daily seene
many poore people at your doore, and (out of your abundance) when
you and your brethren haue fed sufficiently, euery one hath had a good
messe of pottage: now Sir, if for euery dishfull giuen, you are sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
an hundred againe, you will all be meerely drowned in pottage. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="28"/>
though the rest (sitting at the Table with the Inquisitor) laughed heartily
at this iest; yet he found himselfe toucht in another nature, hauing (hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically)
receiued for one poore offence, aboue three hundred peeces of
gold, and not a mite to be restored againe. But fearing to be further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
yet threatning him with another Processe in Law, for abusing the
words of the Gospell; he was content to dismisse him for altogether, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more golden greasing in the hand.</p>

      <p>It is a commendable thing (faire Ladies) to hit a But that neuer stirreth
out of his place: but it is a matter much more admirable, to see a thing
(suddenly appearing, and sildome or neuer frequented before) to be as
suddenly hit by an ordinary Archer. The vicious and polluted liues of
Priests, yeeldeth matter of it selfe in many things, deseruing speech and
reprehension, as a true But of wickednesse, and well worthy to be sharply
<pb n="22" facs="28"/>
shot at. And therefore, though that honest meaning man did wisely, in
touching Master Inquisitor to the quicke, with the hypocriticall charity
of Monkes and Friars, in giuing such things to the poore, as were more
meete for swine, or to be worse throwne away; yet I hold him more to be
commended, who (by occasion of a former tale, and which I purpose to
relate) pleasantly reproued Master <hi>Can de la Scala,</hi> a Magnifico and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Lord, for a sudden and vnaccustomed couetousnesse appearing in him,
figuring by other men, that which he intended to say of him, in manner
following.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Can de la Scala,</hi> as fame ranne abroade of him in all places, was
(beyond the infinite fauours of Fortune towards him) one of the most
notable and magnificent Lords that euer liued in <hi>Italy,</hi> since the dayes of
<hi>Fredericke</hi> the second Emperour. He determining to procure a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
assembly at <hi>Verona,</hi> and many people being met there from diuers
places, especially Gentlemen of all degrees; suddenly (vpon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I know not) his minde altered, and hee would not goe forward with
his intention. Most of them hee partly recompenced which were come
thither, and they dismissed to depart at their pleasure, one onely man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
vnrespected, or in any kinde sort sent away, whose name was <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamino,</hi>
a man very pleasantly disposed, and so wittily ready in speaking
and answering, as none could easily credit it, but such as heard him; and
although his recompence seemed ouer long delayed, yet hee made no
doubt of a beneficiall ending.</p>
      <p>By some enemies of his, Master <hi>Can de la Scala</hi> was incensed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he gaue or bestowed on him; was as ill imployed and vtterly lost,
as if it were throwne into the fire, and therefore he neither did or spake
any thing to him. Some fewe dayes being passed ouer, and <hi>Bergamino</hi>
perceiuing, that hee was neither called, nor any account made of, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
many manly good parts in him; obseruing beside, that hee
found a shrewd consumption in his purse, his Inne, horses, and seruants
being chargeable to him: he beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>n to grow extremely melancholly, and
yet hee attended in expectation day by day, as thinking it farre vnfitting
for him, to depart before he was bidden farewell.</p>
      <p>Hauing brought with him thither three goodly rich garments, which
had beene giuen him by sundry Lords, for his more sightly appearance
at this great meeting: the importunate Host being greedy of payment,
first he deliuered him one of them, and yet not halfe the score being wiped
off, the second must needes follow, and beside, except he meant to leaue
his lodging, hee must liue vpon the third so long as it would last, till hee
saw what end his hopes would sort to. It fortuned, during the time of
liuing thus vpon his latest refuge, that he met with Maister <hi>Can</hi> one day
at dinner, where he presented himselfe before him, with a discontented
countenance: which Maister <hi>Can</hi> well obseruing, more to distaste him,
then take delight in any thing that could come from him, he said. <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi>
how chearest thou? Thou art very melancholly, I pray thee tell vs
why? <hi>Bergamino</hi> suddenly, without any premeditation, yet seeming as if
<pb facs="29"/>
he had long considered thereon, reported this Tale.</p>
      <p>Sir, I haue heard of a certaine man, named <hi>Primasso,</hi> one skilfully lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Grammar, and (beyond all other) a very witty and ready ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifier:
in regard whereof, he was so much admired, and farre renowned,
that such as neuer saw him, but onely heard of him, could easily say, this
is <hi>Primasso.</hi> It came to passe, that being once at <hi>Paris,</hi> in poore estate, as
commonly hee could light on no better fortune (because vertue is slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
rewarded, by such as haue the greatest possessions) he heard much
fame of the Abbot of <hi>Clugni,</hi> a man reputed (next to the Pope) to be the
richest Prelate of the Church. Of him he heard wonderfull and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
matters, that he alwayes kept an open and hospitable Court, and
neuer made refusall of any (from whence so euer hee came or went) but
they did eate and drinke freely there; prouided, that they came when
the Abbot was set at the Table. <hi>Primasso</hi> hearing this, and being an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desirer, to see magnificent and vertuous men; he resolued to goe see
this rare bounty of the Abbot, demaunding how far he dwelt from <hi>Paris.</hi>
Being answered, about some three leagues thence; <hi>Primasso</hi> made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that if he went on betimes in the morning, he should easily reach
thither before the houre for dinner.</p>
      <p>Being instructed in the way, and not finding any to walke along with
him; fearing, if he went without some furnishment, and should stay long
there for his dinner, he might (perhaps) complaine of hunger: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
caried three loaues of bread with him, knowing that he could meete
with water euery where, albeit he vsed to drinke but little. Hauing aptly
conuayed his bread about him, he went on his iourney, and arriued at the
Lord Abbots Court, an indifferent while before dinner time: wherfore,
entring into the great Hall, and so from place to place, beholding the
great multitude of Tables, bountifull preparation in the Kitchin, and
what admirable prouision there was for dinner; he said to himselfe, Truly
this man is more magnificent, then Fame hath made him, because shee
speakes too sparingly of him.</p>
      <p>While thus he went about, considering on all these things, he saw the
Maister of the Abbots houshold (because then it was the houre of din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
commaund water to be brought for washing hands, and euery one
sitting downe at the Table: it fell to the lot of <hi>Primasso,</hi> to sit directly
against the doore, whereat the Abbot must enter into the Hall. The
custome in this Court was such, that no foode should be serued to
any, of the Tables, vntill the Lord Abbot was himselfe first sette:
whereupon, euery thing being fitte and readie, the Maister of the
houshold, went to tell his Lord, that nothing now wanted but his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
onely.</p>
      <p>The Abbot comming from his Chamber to enter the Hall, looking
about him, as hee was wont to doe; the first man hee saw was <hi>Primasso,</hi>
who being but in homely habite, and he hauing not seene him before to
his remembrance; a present bad conceite possessed his braine, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
saw an vnworthier person, saying within himselfe: See how I giue
<pb n="23" facs="29"/>
my goods away to be deuoured. So returning backe to his Chamber
againe, commaunded the doore to be made fast, demaunding of euery
man neere about him, if they knew the base Knaue that sate before his
entrance into the Hall, and all his seruants answered no. <hi>Primasso</hi> being
extreamely hungry, with trauailing on foote so farre, and neuer vsed to
fast so long; expecting still when meate would be serued in, and that the
Abbot came not at all: drew out one of his loaues which hee brought
with him, and very heartily fell to feeding.</p>
      <p>My Lord Abbot, after he had stayed within an indifferent while, sent
forth one of his men, to see if the poore fellow was gone, or no. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
told him, that he still stayed there, and fed vpon dry bread, which it
seemed he had brought thither with him. Let him feede on his owne (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Abbot) for he shall taste of none of mine this day. Gladly wold
the Abbot, that <hi>Primasso</hi> should haue gone thence of himselfe, and yet
held it scarsely honest in his Lordship, to dismisse him by his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<hi>Primasso</hi> hauing eaten one of his Loaues, and yet the Abbot was
not come; began to feede vpon the second: the Abbot still sending to
expect his absence, and answered as he was before. At length, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
not comming, and <hi>Primasso</hi> hauing eaten vp his second loafe, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
compeld him to begin with the third.</p>
      <p>When these newes were carried to the Abbot, sodainly he brake forth
and saide. What new kinde of needy tricke hath my braine begotte this
day? Why do I grow disdainfull against any man whatsoeuer? I haue
long time allowed my meate to be eaten by all commers that did please
to visit me, without exception against any person, Gentleman, Yeoman,
poore or rich, Marchant or Minstrill, honest man or knaue, neuer refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my presence in the Hall, by basely contemning one poore man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
me, couetousnesse of one mans meate, doth ill agree with mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and calling. What though he appeareth a wretched fellow to mee?
He may be of greater merit then I can imagine, and deserue more honor
then I am able to giue him.</p>
      <p>Hauing thus discoursed with himselfe, he would needs vnderstande of
whence and what he was, and finding him to be <hi>Primasso,</hi> come onely to
see the magnificence which he had reported of him, knowing also (by the
generall fame noysed euery whereof him) that he was reputed to bee a
learned, honest, and ingenious man: he grew greatly ashamed of his own
folly, and being desirous to make him an amends, stroue many waies how
to do him honor, When dinner was ended, the Abbot bestowed hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
garments on him, such as beseemed his degree and merit, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
good store of money in his purse, as also giuing him a good horsse
to ride on, left it at his owne free election, whether hee would stay there
still with him, or depart at his pleasure. Wherewith <hi>Primasso</hi> being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented, yeelding him the heartiest thankes he could deuise to doe,
returned to <hi>Paris</hi> on horse-back, albeit he came poorly thether on foot.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Can de la Scala,</hi> who was a man of good vnderstanding, percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
immediately (without any further interpretation) what <hi>Bergamino</hi>
         <pb facs="30"/>
meant by this morall, and smiling on him, saide: <hi>Bergamino,</hi> thou hast
honestly expressed thy vertue and necessities, and iustly reprooued mine
auarice, niggardnesse, and base folly. And trust me <hi>Bergamino,</hi> I neuer
felt such a fit of couetousnesse come vpon me, as this which I haue disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
declared to thee: and which I will now banish from me, with the
same correction as thou hast taught mee. So, hauing payed the Host all
his charges, redeeming also his robes or garments, mounting him on a
good Gelding, and putting plenty of Crownes in his purse, hee referd it
to his owne choise to depart, or dwell there still with him.</p>

      <p>This last discourse (faire and vertuous company) induceth mee to tell
you, how an honest Courtier reprehended in like manner (and nothing
vnprofitably) base couetousnesse in a Merchant of extraordinary wealth.
Which Tale, although (in effect) it may seeme to resemble the former;
yet perhaps, it will proue no lesse pleasing to you, in regard it sorted to
as good an end.</p>
      <p>It is no long time since, that there liued in <hi>Genes</hi> or <hi>Geneway,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="24" facs="30"/>
named Signior <hi>Herminio de Grimaldi,</hi> who (as euery one wel knew)
was more rich in inheritances, and ready summes of currant mony, then
any other knowne Citizen in <hi>Italy.</hi> And as hee surpassed other men in
wealth, so did he likewise excell them in wretched Auarice, being so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
greedy and couetous, as no man in the world could be more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
that way; because, not onely he kept his purse lockt vp from pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any, but denied needful things to himself, enduring many miseries &amp;
distresses, onely to auoide expences, contrary to the <hi>Genewayes</hi> generall
custome, who alwayes delighted to be decently cloathed, and to haue
their dyet of the best. By reason of which most miserable basenesse, they
tooke from him the sir-name of <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> whereof hee was in right des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended:
and called him master <hi>Herminio</hi> the couetous Mizer, a nickname
very notably agreeing with his gripple nature.</p>
      <p>It came to passe, that in this time of his spending nothing, but multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
daily by infinite meanes, that a ciuill honest Gentleman (a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
of ready wit, and discoursiue in Languages) came to <hi>Geneway,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
named <hi>Guillaume Boursier.</hi> A man very farre differing from diuers
Courtiers in these dayes, who for soothing shamefull and gracelesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
in such as allow them maintenance, are called and reputed to bee
Gentlemen, yea especiall fauourites: whereas much more worthily, they
should be accounted as knaues and villaines, being borne and bred in all
filthinesse, and skilfull in euery kinde of basest behauiour, not fit to come
in Princes Courts. For, whereas in passed times, they spent their dayes
and paines in making peace, when Gentlemen were at warre or dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or treating on honest marriages, betweene friends and familiars, &amp;
(with louing speeches) would recreate disturbed mindes, desiring none
but commendable exercises in Court, and sharpely reproouing (like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
disordred life, or ill actions in any, albeit with recompence little,
or none at all: these vpstarts now adayes, employ all their paines in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
sowing questions and quarrels betweene one another, making
no spare of lyes &amp; falshoods. Nay which is worse, they will do this in the
presence of any man, vpbraiding him with iniuries, shames, and scandals
(true or not true) vpon the very least occasion. And by false and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
flatteries and villanies of their own inuenting, they make Gentlemen
to become as vile as themselues. For which detestable qualities, they are
better beloued and respected of theyr misdemeanor'd Lords, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
in more bountiful manner, then men of vertuous carriage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
Which is an argument sufficient, that goodnesse is gone vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and hath quite forsaken these loathed lower Regions, where men are
drowned in the mud of all abhominable vices.</p>
      <p>But returning where I left (being led out of my way by a iust and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

no doubt but you haue heard and seene many things, and you can
instruct me in some quaint conceit or deuise, to be fairely figured in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
at the entrance into the great Hall of my House. Master <hi>Guillaume</hi>
hearing him speake so simply, returned him this answere; Sir, I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
you in any thing, so rare or vnseen as you talke of: but how to sneeze
(after a new manner) vpon a full and ouercloyed stomacke, to auoide
base humours that stupifie the braine, or other matters of the like quality.
But if you would be taught a good one indeede, and had a disposition to
see it fairely effected; I could instruct you in an excellent Embleme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(as yet) you neuer came acquainted.</p>
      <p>Master <hi>Herminio</hi> hearing him say so, and expecting no such answere as
he had saide; Good Master <hi>Guillaume,</hi> tell me what it is, and on my faith
I will haue it fairely painted. Whereto Master <hi>Guillaume</hi> suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
Doe nothing but this Sir; Paint ouer the Portall at your Halles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
the liuely picture of Liberality, to bid all your friends better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
then hitherto they haue beene. When Master <hi>Herminio</hi> heard
these words, he became possessed with such a sudden shame, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
changed from the former palenesse, and answered thus. Master
<hi>Guillaume,</hi> I will haue your aduice so truly figured ouer my gate, and shee
shall giue so good welcome to all my guests, that both you, and all these
Gentlemen shall say; I haue both seene her, and am become reasonably

      <p>In the dayes of the first King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> after the Conquest made in the

trauelling in pilgrimage, to visit the sacred Sepulcher in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
returning home againe, arriued at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where shee was villanou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly

but loose her labour, because hee was so womanish, and faint-hearted;
that not onely he refused to punish with iustice the offences of others, but
also suffered shamefull iniuries done to himselfe. And therefore, such as
were displeased by his negligence, might easily discharge their spleene
against him, and doe him what dishonour they would.</p>
      <p>When the Gentlewoman heard this, despairing of any consolation,

had allowed them (in their owne idle conceite) no other kinde of
talking.</p>
      <p>Most true it is, that as there is a respect to be vsed in the action of other
things; so, time and place are necessarily to be considered, and also whom
we conuerse withall; because sometimes it happeneth, that a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
intending (by a word of iest and merriment) to make another body
blush or be ashamed: not knowing what strength of wit remaineth in
the opposite, doe conuert the same disgrace vpon themselues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that we may the more aduisedly stand vpon our owne guard, and to
preuent the common prouerbe, <hi>That Women (in all things) make choyse of
the woorst:</hi> I desire that this dayes last tale, which is to come from my
selfe, may make vs all wise. To the end, that as in gentlenesse of minde
we conferre with other; so by excellency in good manners, we may shew
our selues not inferiour to them.</p>
      <p>It is not many yeares since (worthy assembly) that in <hi>Bulloigne</hi> there
dwelt a learned Physitian, a man famous for skill, and farre renowned,
whose name was Master <hi>Albert,</hi> and being growne aged, to the estimate
of threescore and tenne yeares: hee had yet such a sprightly disposition,
that though naturall heate and vigour had quite shaken hands with him,
yet amorous flames and desires had not wholly forsaken him. Hauing
seene (at a Banquet) a very beautifull woman, being then in the estate of
widdowhood, named (as some say) Madame <hi>Margaret de Chisolieri,</hi> shee
appeared so pleasing in his eye; that his sences became no lesse distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
then as if he had beene of farre younger temper, and no night could
any quietnesse possesse his soule, except (the day before) he had seene the
sweet countenance of this louely widdow. In regard whereof, his dayly
passage was by her doore, one while on horsebacke, and then againe on
foote; as best might declare his plaine purpose to see her.</p>
      <p>Both shee and other Gentlewomen, perceiuing the occasion of his
<pb facs="33"/>
passing and repassing; would priuately iest thereat together, to see a man
of such yeares and discretion, to be amorously addicted, or ouer-swayed
by effeminate passions. For they were partly perswaded, that such wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Ague fits of Loue, were fit for none but youthfull apprehensions, as
best agreeing with their chearefull complexion. Master <hi>Albert</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his dayly walkes by the widdowes lodging, it chaunced vpon a Feasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
day, that shee (accompanied with diuers other women of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
being sitting at her doore; espied Master <hi>Albert</hi> (farre off) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thitherward, and a resolued determination among themselues was
set downe, to allow him fauourable entertainement, and to iest (in some
merry manner) at his louing folly, as afterward they did indeede.</p>
      <p>No sooner was he come neere, but they all arose, and courteously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
him to enter with them, conducting him into a goodly Garden,
where readily was prepared choyse of delicate wines and banquetting.
At length, among other pleasant and delightfull discourses, they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of him: how it was possible for him, to be amorously affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
so beautifull a woman, both knowing and seeing, how earnestly she
was sollicited by many gracious, gallant, and youthfull spirits, ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with her yeares and desires? Master <hi>Albert</hi> perceiuing, that they had
drawne him in among them, onely to scoffe and make a mockery of him;
set a merry countenance on the matter, and honestly thus answered.</p>
      <p>Beleeue mee Gentlewoman (speaking to the widdowe her selfe) it
should not appeare strange to any of wisedome and discretion, that I am
amorously enclined, and especially to you, because you are well worthy
of it. And although those powers, which naturally appertaine to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of Loue, are bereft and gone from aged people; yet good will
thereto cannot be taken from them, neither iudgement to know such as
deserue to be affected: for, by how much they exceede youth in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and experience, by so much the more hath nature made them meet
for respect and reuerence. The hope which incited me (being aged) to
loue you, that are affected of so many youthfull Gallants, grew thus. I
haue often chaunced into diuers places, where I haue seene Ladies and
Gentlewomen, being disposed to a Collation or rere-banquet after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to feede on Lupines, and young Onions or Leekes, and although it
may be so, that there is little or no goodnesse at all in them; yet the heads
of them are least hurtfull, and most pleasing in the mouth. And you
Gentlewomen generally (guided by vnreasonable appetite) will hold the
heads of them in your hands, and feede vpon the blades or stalkes: which
not onely are not good for any thing, but also are of very bad sauour. And
what know I (Lady) whether among the choise of friends, it may fit your
fancy to doe the like? For, if you did so, it were no fault of mine to be
chosen of you, but thereby were all the rest of your suters the sooner an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
      <p>The widdowed Gentlewoman, and all the rest in her company, being
bashfully ashamed of her owne and their folly, presently said. Master
<hi>Albert,</hi> you haue both well and worthily chastised our ouer-bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb n="27" facs="33"/>
and beleeue mee Sir, I repute your loue and kindnesse of no
meane merrit, comming from a man so wise and vertuous: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(mine honour reserued) commaund my vttermost, as alwayes ready
to do you any honest seruice. Master <hi>Albert,</hi> arising from his seat, thanking
the faire widdow for her gentle offer; tooke leaue of her and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and she blushing, as all the rest were therein in not much behinde her,
thinking to checke him, became chidden her selfe, whereby (if wee be
wise) let vs all take warning.</p>
      <p>The Sunne was now somewhat farre declined, and the heates extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
well worne away, when the Tales of the seauen Ladies and three
Gentlemen were thus finished, whereupon their Queene pleasantly said.
For this day (faire company) there remaineth nothing more to be done
vnder my regiment, but onely to bestow a new Queene vpon you, who
(according to her iudgement) must take her turne, and dispose what next
is to be done, for continuing our time in honest pleasure. And although
the day should endure till darke night; in regard, that when some time is
taken before, the better preparation may be made for occasions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
to the end also, that whatsoeuer the new Queene shall please to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
may be the better fitted for the morrow: I am of opinion, that at
the same houre as we now cease, the following dayes shall seuerally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
And therefore, in reuerence to him that giueth life to all things, and
in hope of comfort by our second day; Madame <hi>Philomena,</hi> a most wise
young Lady, shall gouerne as Queene this our Kingdome.</p>
      <p>So soone as she had thus spoken, arising from her seate of dignity, and
taking the Lawrell Crowne from off her owne head; she reuerently pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it vpon Madame <hi>Philomenaes,</hi> she first of all humbly saluting her, and
then all the rest, openly confessing her to be their Queene, made graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
offer to obey whatsoeuer she commaunded. <hi>Philomena,</hi> her cheekes
deliuering a scarlet tincture, to see her selfe thus honoured as their
Queene, and well remembring the words, so lately vttered by Madame
<hi>Pampinea;</hi> that dulnesse or neglect might not be noted in her, tooke
cheerefull courage to her, and first of all, she confirmed the officers, which
<hi>Pampinea</hi> had appointed the day before, then shee ordained for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
prouision, as also for the supper so neere approaching, before they
departed away from thence, and then thus began.</p>
      <p>Louely Companions, although that Madam <hi>Pampinea,</hi> more in her
owne courtesie, then any matter of merit remaining in mee, hath made
me your Queene: I am not determined, to alter the forme of our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
life, nor to be guided by mine owne iudgement, but to associate the
same with your assistance. And because you may know what I intend
to do, and so (consequently) adde or diminish at your pleasure; in verie
few words, you shall plainly vnderstand my meaning. If you haue well
considered on the course, which this day hath bene kept by Madam <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinea,</hi>
me thinkes it hath bene very pleasing and commendable; in which
regard, vntill by ouer-tedious continuation, or other occasions of irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
offence, it shall seeme iniurious, I am of the minde, not to alter it.
<pb facs="34"/>
Holding on the order then as we haue begun to do, we will depart from
hence to recreate our selues awhile, and when the Sun groweth towards
setting, we will sup in the fresh and open ayre: afterward, with Canzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and other pastimes, we will out-weare the houres till bed time. To
morrow morning, in the fresh and gentle breath thereof, we will rise &amp;
walke to such places, as euery one shall finde fittest for them, euen as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
this day we haue done; vntill due time shall summon vs hither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to continue our discoursiue Tales, wherein (me thinkes) consisteth
both pleasure and profit, especially by discreete obseruation.</p>
      <p>Very true it is, that some things which Madam <hi>Pampinea</hi> coulde not
accomplish, by reason of her so small time of authority, I will beginne to
vndergo, to wit, in restraining some matters whereon we are to speake,
that better premeditation may passe vpon them. For, when respite and
a little leysure goeth before them, each discourse will sauour of the more
formality; and if it might so please you, thus would I direct the order.
As since the beginning of the world, all men haue bene guided (by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune)
thorow diuers accidents and occasions: so beyond all hope &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
the issue and successe hath bin good and succesfull, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
should euery one of our arguments be chosen.</p>
      <p>The Ladies, and the yong Gentlemen likewise, commended her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and promised to imitate it; onely <hi>Dioneus</hi> excepted, who when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one was silent, spake thus. Madam, I say as all the rest haue done,
that the order by you appointed, is most pleasing and worthy to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
But I intreate one speciall fauour for my selfe, and to haue it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to me, so long as our company continueth; namely, that I may
not be constrained to this Law of direction, but to tell my Tale at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
after mine owne minde, and according to the freedome first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And because no one shall imagine, that I vrge this grace of you, as
being vnfurnished of discourses in this kinde, I am well contented to be
the last in euery dayes exercise.</p>
      <p>The Queene, knowing him to be a man full of mirth and matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to consider very aduisedly, that he would not haue mooued this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
but onely to the end, that if the company grew wearied by any of
the Tales re-counted, hee would shut vppe the dayes disport with some
mirthfull accident. Wherefore willingly, and with consent of al the rest
he had his suite granted. So, arising all, they walked to a Christall riuer,
descending downe a little hill into a vally, graciously shaded with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trees; where washing both their hands and feete, much pretty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
passed among them; till supper time drawing nere, made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home to the Palace. When supper was ended, and bookes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
being laide before them, the Queene commanded a dance, &amp;
that Madam <hi>Aemilia,</hi> assisted by Madam <hi>Lauretta</hi> and <hi>Dioneus,</hi> shold sing
a sweet ditty. At which command, <hi>Lauretta</hi> vndertooke the dance, and
led it, <hi>Aemilia</hi> singing this song ensuing.</p>

         <head>The Song.</head>
         <lg>
            <l>SO much delight my beauty yeelds to mee,</l>
            <l>That any other Loue,</l>

         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Therein I see, vpon good obseruation,</l>

            <l>Olde or new thoughts cannot in any fashion</l>

         <lg>
            <l>But were it so, the blisse that I would chuse,</l>
            <l>Is, by continuall sight to comfort me:</l>
            <l>So rare a presence neuer to refuse,</l>
            <l>Which mortall tongue or thought, what ere it be;</l>
            <l>Must still conceale,</l>
            <l>not able to reueale,</l>
            <l>Such a sacred sweete,</l>
            <l>for none other meete,</l>
            <l>But hearts enflamed with the same desire.</l>
            <l>So much delight, &amp;c.</l>
         </lg>
      </lg>
      <p>The Song being ended, the Chorus whereof was aunswered by them
all, it passed with generall applause: and after a few other daunces, the
night being well run on, the Queene gaue ending to this first dayes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
So, lights being brought, they departed to their seuerall Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
to take their rest till the next morning.</p>
