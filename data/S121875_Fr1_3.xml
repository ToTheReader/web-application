For as your Majesty is <hi>Summus Pater patriae,</hi> the chiefe of your people under God, that not onely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for their soules health, that they may have the pure Word of God, whereby to live ever, wherein we justly claime the prerogative above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nation under Heaven, and most devoutly praise God for the same, and desire religiously to live thereunder: but many wayes also for their bodily estates, by good and wholesome Lawes, that every one may live obediently and peaceably under their owne Vine and Figtree, and by protection, &amp;c. And I doubt not of your Majesties further care of their bodies health, that such Workes as deliver approved remedyes may be divulged, whereby they may both cure and prevent their diseases. Most properly therefore doth this Worke belong to your Majesties Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage both to further and defend, that malevolent spirits should not dare to cast forth their venome or aspertions, to the prejudice of any well deserving, but that therby under God and good direction, all may live in health, as well as wealth, peace, and godlines, which God grant, and that this boldnesse may be pardoned to</p>
