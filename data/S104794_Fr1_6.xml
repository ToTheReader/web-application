   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou troubled mindes with tormentes toste,</l>
   <l>that sighes and sobs consumes:</l>
   <l>(Who breathes and puffes from burning breast,</l>
   <l>both smothring smoke and fumes.)</l>
   <l>Come reade this booke that freelye bringes, a boxe of balme full swete,</l>
   <l>An oyle to noynt the brused partes, of euerye heauye spriete.</l>
   <l>A souplinge salue for euerye sore, a medcine for the sicke,</l>
   <l>A seede that eates vp cankred fleshe, and searcheth neare the quicke.</l>
   <l>Eche griefe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> growes by error blinde (that makes mās iudgemēt iarre)</l>
   <l>May here a precious plaster finde, eare corsye creepe to farre.</l>
   <l>The blinde that mournes for want of sight, coulde he but heare this red,</l>
   <l>Would take his blindnes in good part, and beare a quiet hed.</l>
   <l>The lame whose lacke of legges is death, vnto a loftye mynde,</l>
   <l>Wyll kisse his crotche and creepe on knees, <hi>Cardanus</hi> woorkes to fynde.</l>
   <l>The begger bare bedeckt in brats, and patched rotten rags,</l>
   <l>In budget if he bare this booke, would scorne the roysters brags.</l>
   <l>The shepehearde that in skortchinge sunne, sits skowling on the skyes,</l>
   <l>Would leaue the wolfe his flocke of sheepe, to see this booke wyth eyes.</l>
   <l>The surlye snodge that sweepes vp golde, and makes his God thereon,</l>
   <l>Would sure cōfesse this pearle shold shyne, whē glistring gold were gon.</l>
   <l>The wyldest man or monster strange, whose natures naughtye are,</l>
   <l>Would stand a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>de as bucke at baye, vppon this booke to stare,</l>
   <l>This is no fable finelye fylde, as cutlare workes the blade,</l>
   <l>This is a substance of it selfe, this is no sillye shade.</l>
   <l>This speakes out of the brasen heade, full many a golden word,</l>
   <l>This strykes the stordye stomackes dead, and yet it drawes no sworde.</l>
   <l>This threatens thonderboltes for fooles, yet weather fayre it showes,</l>
   <l>So such as can beare of a storme, and calmye weather knowes.</l>
   <l>This teacheth mē to tune theyr strings, who would sweete musicke make</l>
   <l>This showes who faynes, or sweetely sings: &amp; where the tune we take.</l>
   <l>The poore that playnes on pinching plagues, by this doth stand content,</l>
   <l>And yeldinge thankes for foode and cloth, takes well y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> God hath sent.</l>
   <l>The rich whose raging reach would reape, the sweete of euery soyle,</l>
   <l>Shall learne to singe a mixrye meane, and leaue the poore the spoyle.</l>
   <l>The hye or hautye hart shal here, a liuelye lesson learne,</l>
   <l>How wysedome holdes himselfe vpright, and halting heades deserne.</l>
   <l>The lowe that lours at lothsome locke, and lingers out his tyme,</l>
   <l>Shal see how safe the simple si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, and how they fall that clyme.</l>
   <l>The strong that striues to winne the goale, by strength &amp; stoutnes vaine,</l>
   <l>Shall shunne the shouldring croked play, and walke the path full plaine.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/> The weake whose wits wyth woes are worne (which breedes in brest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare)</l>
   <l>Shal laughe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> giants strength to scorne, &amp; prayse the feeble state,</l>
   <l>The sicke that seekes a syrope sweete, for soure disease wythin,</l>
   <l>Shal helpe the heapes of harmes in hart, eare blister rise on skin.</l>
   <l>The proude y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> poultes and pickes his plumes, &amp; prunes his fethers gay,</l>
   <l>Shal meekenes showe and forthwyth fling, his painted sheath away.</l>
   <l>The prisner that in fetters lyes, shal thincke his fredome more,</l>
   <l>In closed walles than al his scoope, that he hath had before,</l>
   <l>The banisht wight that beates his braynes, wyth many busy broyles,</l>
   <l>Shal see what gaine exile doth bringe, by sight of sondrye soyles.</l>
   <l>The seruaunt that in seruage lyues, shall fee hee hath more ease,</l>
   <l>Than hath his maister who of force, must many people please.</l>
   <l>The fearefull man that hateth death, shall see that death is best,</l>
   <l>And death is most to be desyrde, where life can breede no rest.</l>
   <l>The dronken dolt that doth delite, in sosse, in swashe, and swill,</l>
   <l>Shall see some snib or soure rebuke, to breake him of his will.</l>
   <l>The foole that all sound counsell hates, perhaps in reading this,</l>
   <l>Maye waxe more wyse and fondnes leaue, and so amende the mis.</l>
   <l>The flatterer here may finde his faults, and fall to better frame,</l>
   <l>The currishe earle may ciuill be, in noting of the same.</l>
   <l>The cowarde shall win courage great, as he this booke shall vewe,</l>
   <l>And he that is not shaped right, may here be made a newe.</l>
   <l>The plowman that wyth sweat of browes, doth dearely win his bred.</l>
   <l>Shall see what daunger dwell they in, that are wyth daintyes fed.</l>
   <l>There is no state that beareth lyfe, of hye or lowe degree,</l>
   <l>But for the sickenes of his minde, a medsine here may see.</l>
   <l>This booke bewrayes what wretched wracke, belongs to life of man,</l>
   <l>What burthens bore he on hys backe, since first this world began.</l>
   <l>This is a glasse to gaze vpon, where man himselfe may finde,</l>
   <l>A shyning sunne that plainlye shewes, <hi>A man is but his minde,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>And who that reads and marks a right, the reasons couched here,</l>
   <l>Shal win such treasures by the same, as he shall hold ful dere.</l>
   <l>Passe on plaine booke of pearelesse price, and preace in worthye place,</l>
   <l>Dread no disdaine of froward heads, nor feare the frowning face.</l>
   <l>A worthye worke doth iustly craue, a worthye patrone still,</l>
   <l>Whose noble bucklar shall defende, this worthye worke from in.</l>
   <l>And he that made thee Englishe speake, his tongue and penne be blest,</l>
   <l>Wyth happye hope of vertues hye, from heauen, here possest.</l>
