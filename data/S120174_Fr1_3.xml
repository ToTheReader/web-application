      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I must confesse that my ouerdaring attempt, deserues a disgracefull checke, who like <hi>Icarus,</hi> with waxen wings hath soard so high, but that the sun beames haue beene fauourable, my downfall might be as sodains: this president is none of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and beeing so farre vnfit intend not to make it my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize. An extraordinarie cause compels me to this worke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you must expect an explanation by an Alneger and not by an Oratour: and as I most desire the good opinion of the best, who doe alwaies censure well, so I least regard the taunts of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort, who commonly carpe at all. If amongst these rude weeds, you can gather any wholsome herbes to serue your vse I shall then gaine what I most sought for. I am the more inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to aduenture because this vessell is bound to that port, where yet noe other hath beene before mee with like lading, whose better beautified wares had spoilde my market: yet haue I trauelled as much to collect, and beene as carefull in the choise of this fraight as any whatsoeuer: and imagine that he which in this, trades farther, shall deale for a doubtfull gaine, beeing commoditie not vendible for all, but rather vtterly reiected by some, yet good hope may drawe them on, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the same sort, or the least companie and worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who knoweth not that from one flower the Bee drawes hony and the Spider poyson, and that the content of the good, is the contempt of the euill: Therefore my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is set, hap how it wil, if the voiage mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie I am not the first whom hope hath deluded, but will striue to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied howsoeuer. And so I take my leaue.</p>
