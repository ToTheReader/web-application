      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O report strange and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents, is subiect both to danger and disgrace: to danger, in that they may bee held as prodigious, or omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous: to disgrace, in that they may bee reputed fabulous. There can be no danger in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, so that there bee no prognosticating, which by all meanes I doe forbeare: onely I will say with the Royall Prophet, <hi>Admirabilis Deus in omnibus operibus suis,</hi> God is wonderfull in all his workes. And with <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> That <hi>as it was not impossible for Almighty God in his first creation to make what variety of creatures he pleased, so it is not impossible for his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to alter and change the ordinary course and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the creatures which hee hath made.</hi> Which may appeare in this Narration following, the like neuer heard or euer seene, by testimony of any
<pb facs="3"/>
      recorder history in any Countrey heretofore. I need not to feare disgrace in reporting so strange an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be reputed fabulous, being able to free my selfe from any suspition of such an imputation by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of Letters, from Right Honorable persons in Ireland where the accident fell out, to Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons at Court, and diuers in London at this present: as also by the testimony of Right Honourable and Worshipfull persons, &amp; others of good reputation now in London, who were eye-witnesses, beholding the same, during the time it continued. Notwithstanding so ample proofe of what I write, yet I doe confesse, that so many poeticall fictions haue of late passed the print, that they haue some cause to suspect almost euery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary report that is printed: but now that abuse done to the Common-wealth is vtterly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: for no Currantos, no reports of History, with the like, may now passe the print, without strict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and sufficient approbation, as in experience and tryall will be found hereafter. These strange newes out of Ireland had beene printed before this time, but that it hath beene stayed till the truth were fully cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and examined.</p>
