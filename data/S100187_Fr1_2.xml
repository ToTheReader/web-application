   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE INDIFFERENT and Iudicious Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lexander the Great, King of Macedon, amongst all other bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons of his honour, hath this not the least: That in hearing of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both his eares were open to both parties, Plaintiffe, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant: That being rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his decision of the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie might be vpright, not partiall. As this is the duty of euery learned and iudiciall Reader: so in this question of mine, I cannot entertaine other thought, then expectance of all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: Not onely to haue eares, and all other senses auersed from the tongues and quills of idly-learned slanderers, but also reserued vnto a generous equanimitie towards the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and equable reply of the Defendant. Not doubting therefore (gentle Reader) of this your disposition, I haue written, and dedicated to your hands and hearts, to take, reade, digest and cherish this Apologie of my Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and administration of my Essence and Liquor of Gold, commonly called Aurum Potabile or Potable Golde: with assurance of censure on my side, though distasting the
<pb facs="3"/> A-B-C-darie and Comicall Rayler. If therefore my malicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners haue heretofore seduced you into sinister constructions of this cause, it was not your fault, but their posting malice, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating and forestalling that better and true Information, which this Apologie freely now offereth, and earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth to be so accepted. Many good men haue iustly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained against the Pasquelling libertie of traducing slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. If a sufficient conclusion should rest therein, yea, or a moouing Inducement: then you with me must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that no vertue shall haue his due regard, no man of whatsoeuer desert, shall be secure of his good name. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and satisfaction preseruatiue: my shield and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the tainted darts of such aduersaries, shall bee securitie against foule challenge, Impossibilitie of attaint, the warrant of truth: which in her naked simplicitie shall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me, in the vprightnesse of a good conscience against all their attempts, and by Gods grace, powerfully deliuer me. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you therefore (indifferent and sincere Readers) I conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the protection both of this Treatise, and of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine it selfe therein handled. Because, as no man is created solely for his owne particular, but for the profit and good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; (for nature hath made, and charitie commanded a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie and neighbourhood betwixt all men) so this being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially a kinde of vniuersall Medicine: it ought not to be restrained from the publike tēder of profit to all men. Socrates being demanded what Countriman he was, answered, not only an Athenian but a Cosmopolitane, a Cittizen of that great Commonwealth, the whole world. So ought euery good Physition in the publike profession of his facultie, not to burie his talent in the soyle of one Countrey, but to remember, that the very Character of his calling doth challenge the fruits of his function for all the world, so far as possible capacitie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth; specially of this neerest communitie in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb facs="3"/> Let it not therefore seeme strange vnto you, (worthy Readers) that without exception of Countrey or nation, I doe indefinitely appeale vnto all, and in such generality consigne these fruitions, which long study, labor &amp; chargeable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue confirmed vnto me, in my profession and Practise of Physicke. Arist. saith morally (but the sentēce is diuine) <hi>Bonū quo cōmunius, eò melius.</hi> The more cōmō a good thing is, the better it is. Of which followeth one reason of this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent act: <hi>Omne Donū quo melius, eò comunicabilius.</hi> The better any gift is, the more cōmunicable also ought it to be. And as it is so in nature it self, so ought it to be in the dispē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the possessour. I do not herein so propose, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie mine own endeuours, &amp; the perfection of this Medicine by my selfe made, with a solitarie conceit, and ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, as though no person else where were seized of the like (and peraduenture in a higher degree of exaltation) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods blessings and gifts, to my selfe amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, I may not hide my talent in the earth: But beside the present vses hereof in most vrgent causes of health, do also wish the prouoking, and virtuous emulation in others, to incite their industries in the search and labour of excellent necessity for a common good. Also that so generall a Medicine may as generally be knowne to be had, to the intent to be vsed in all places. The opinion of euery excellent, both ancient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Physitions, concerning the virtue, power, efficacie and vse of Potable gold, is conuested in their owne writings: who do hold firme, that no Physition can well saue the performing honour of his profession, without Potable gold, howsoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he be furnished with herball Medicines. In which kind also, God hath stored so many particular adiuments, for the reliefe of mans miserable maladies, that none ought to neglect the indagation of their virtues, the preparation of their parts, and administration of their Remedies. Which as</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>I gladly and happily vse in fit time and place, so I also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the like vse to others, euen with this Potable Gold, as is commonly vsed in sundry other Polychresticke, or Panchre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke Medicines: according to euery present requisition of occasions and circumstances, by the aduice of any rationall and experienced Physition. With which profession I offer and submit the respect and acceptance of my Inuentions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring you all, with like regard and fauour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and embrace this my will and desire of doing good, and to be profitable to many.</p>
