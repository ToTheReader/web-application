   <head>Farewell Court.</head>
   <head type="sub">The Preface to a Treatise ensuing,
compyled by the Authour, vpon a theme giuen
by his approued friend and kinsman
Maister A. D.</head>
   <p>I Haue, according to my promise, though slenderly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
this simple discourse on the theme that yee gaue
me, which was your Farwel to the court: which although
it be nothing so well handled, as by some experienced
courtier it might haue beene done: neuerthelesse it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considered, that my education hath beene so far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the court, that I neuer sawe the fashions of the
court, I hope that the priuiledge of a pardon may bee
purchased for my excuse in this behalfe. I haue heerein
introduced Witte and Wil as two domestical counsellers,
alwayes attendant on a man marching in this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie:
The one giuing him trustie and wholsome admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
how hee should here direct his life to the glory of
God, and his soules health: The other with the flattering
alluremets of the sinfull flesh, enticeth him to the pursutes
of the pleasures of this worlde, in the end drouning him
in the puddle of al abhomination, to the vtter confusion
both of body and soule. Vnder the person of Wit is prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
a man, hauing a certaine carefull regarde of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which is once in a mans life instilled into the harts of
those, whome God hath sealed vp vnto saluation, and
causeth them cleane to cast away the vile and vaine vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that the wicked world accounteth as precious, and
addict all their doings towards the attainement of lyfe
<pb n="65" facs="72"/>
euerlasting. Vnder the person of Wil, is picturde out, how
a man letting flippe the bridle of his affections, is caryed
from the precious paths of perfect felicitie, to the ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
daungers of drowning <hi>Caribdis:</hi> and so passing the
sea of this world, not stopping his eares with the waxe of
vnderstanding, the voluptuous pleasures thereof, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>Sirens,</hi> entice him to the folowing of them, whome
they presently drown in such delights, that he hath neuer
farther regarde to the preseruing of his soule, but imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the nature of bruite beastes, addicteth himselfe onely
vnto that, which his owne sensuall appetite shal allowe to
be good. Although this may, peraduenture seeme vnto
you, a too far fetched circumstance, little or nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the purpose: yet my hope is, that when yee
haue throughly perused it, yee shall not finde the theme
that ye gaue me, left altogether vntouched. The best is, I
know your thankfull disposition to be such, that how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it be, being willingly offered, it shal not of you be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
accepted. Thus referring the view heereof to
your discret consideration, I wishe you and yours abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of such prosperitie, as your heart desireth.</p>
