      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ngland my deere Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey giue mee leaue, out of loue and dutie, a dutifull and louing Seruant to speake vnto thee. Contrary passions affect my heart, as diuers thoughts distract my mind, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the wofull plight of thy distressed neighbours, with the ioyfull estate of thy blessed selfe. VVhile I thinke of their miserie, I feare what may happen to thee, weighing thy many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by thy many enemies, and mistrusting a change through the changeable course of the world, which turning round lyke a vvheele, placeth those alowe which stood aloft, and long suffereth none in one state to continue. This hauing seene paynted before mine eyes in the Histories of the greatest kingdomes, and heard sounded into mine eares by the sayings of the
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>wisest men, griefe hath pierced into my head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying it selfe in the windowes thereof, hath passed downe into the verie bottome of my hart. VVherein if I goe to farre, impute it to my loue which knoweth no measure,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Musae: de Hero. et Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> Of other loue spoken but in all loue true. <hi>Ouid. Epist</hi> 1</note> and cannot be left voide of care, beeing alwayes attended on vvith feare. It is sayed to be <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, sweete, but bitter withall, because the sweet it tasteth is bitter seasoned euermore, and otherwise it cannot be, when as
<q>
         <l>Res est soliciti plena timoris amor.</l>
         <l>
            <hi>Loue is full of carefull feare.</hi>
         </l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>But turning to thy selfe to my ioy I see, that yet thou standest where thou hast done, and thou art as thou hast beene by the space of many yeares, high to the view, happie to the wonder of the world. As a field oft troden with the foote of the owner, as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den still subiect to the sight of the Maister, thou art both faire and fruitfull: and no meruaile, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured continuallie vvith the carefull steps, and euer looked vnto with the watchfull eye, of the greatest Mistris, the most worthy Princesse of the earth. For thy defence, Nature hath cōpassed thee with a strong fence of that which is by nature weake, it selfe lying open to euery storme, keepeth thee close from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thy foes, and serueth as well to disburthen thy aboundance, as to supply thy wants. Thy walls are of vvood yet surer then stone, made by Art to strengthen Natures worke, which without them might against her will import thy hurt, being intended for thy good.
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>Thereby long sithence Greece was deliuered from the innumerable forces of the proud Persian see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her dominion,
<note place="margin">Herodo. vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> and by the same a few yeares past thy selfe wast preserued from the inuincible Nauie of thy professed enemie, thirsting after thy destruction. Looke nearer home, and thou shalt see thy strength to be greater yet, not in Castels or fortifications artificially framed, nor in masse of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches politickly gathered, though there be want of neither, but in the braue minds and faithfull harts of thy people where-vnto no force is to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, no treasure is to be esteemed equall.
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Eutrop. lib.</hi> 2.</note> Such were the Romanes of whom <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> sayed, that if such Souldiours had happened vnto him, he could haue been Lord and commaunder of the world. Yet is not that thy strongest gard which consisteth in the strength of men: by wisedome thy daungers are foreseene, &amp; by counsell preuented of those, which Lyon-like, sleepe not but with their eyes open, and are lifted vp, and placed next before thy gates, in regard they are both watchfull, full of courage and might.
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Contar. de rep. vene. lib.</hi> 3. There the chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate is a Duke, but all gouern by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> The chiefe meanes which long haue held the Venetian state in securitie, and might seeme to suffise, for thy safetie: but pardon me, if those with the rest for thee, I thinke to be nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues though wise, prouident, and carefull in all, as they ought to be. For, they are limmes but haue no life, armes but out of ioynt, dead eyes which doo not see, deafe eares which cannot heare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Soueraigne, which is thy soule, that giueth
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>life, strength, and sence both to them and thee. Shee lyuing thou canst not dye, she raigning thou shalt commaund, thou shalt flourish, while she doth prosper, <hi>Inuitis dentibus et ensibus</hi> maugre the might, and malice, of thy greatest foes. For why? her life is precious, her gouernment is pleasing in his eye, which is Lord of Lords, and ruleth both in heauen and on earth. Her studie is to enrich her selfe with vnderstanding and wisedome, wherein as there can be no excesse, so no measure can slake her ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, such is her desire to obey God, and to order thee. And to the end blind ignorance should be banished out of thy bounds, and knowledge seated in all thy quarters, it is not her least care that al good arts and learnings, should be taught and trayned vp in thy Schooles, and sent forth into thy Citties, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and Townes, especiallie to attend as Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayds vpon that Lady Science, <hi>Diuinity,</hi> more to be honoured then all the rest besides. So as who so looketh into thy Vniuersities, may thinke that the liberall Arts, which are sayed to haue beene borne in Athens, and long sithence expelled thence, are now bred, and harboured with thee, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he goeth, he may heare the full quier of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in thy Temples to make musick to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. VVherefore of her excellencie thou mayest be proud, in her Maiestie thou oughtest to reioyce, and as of <hi>Iudith</hi> the Seruants of <hi>Holofernes</hi> sayed,
<note place="margin">Iudith, 11.</note>
      <hi>There is not such a woman vpon the earth for beauty of face, and wisedome of speech,</hi> so lifting vp thine eyes to
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>her highnes, what thou mayst see I neede not say, but for heauenlie and worldly wisedome, thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines incomparable to the world doth pronounce, her highnes is not to be compared with. Then looking vppon thy selfe, remember what Queene <hi>Saba</hi> sayd to <hi>Solomon,
<note place="margin">2, Chro 9.</note> Because thy God loueth I sraell to establish it for euer, therefore hee hath placed thee King ouer them, that thou mightest doo iudgement and iustice;</hi> and take it for an assured argument of Gods great fauour towards thee, that ouer thee he hath set such a Soueraigne, as of wisedome and vertue, doth iudgement and iustice, sincerely before God, and vprightly in the sight of men. So hauing the fauor of the mighty <hi>Iehoua,</hi> witnessed by the raigne of her excellent Maiestie, thou mayest boldlie say,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Proper.</hi> 2.</note>
      <hi>Viuam siviuat,</hi> I shall liue if she doo well, and mayest thou not as truly say? <hi>Si cadat illa, cadam,</hi> I shall fall, if she doo faile? the beginning of the verse the eyes of all men see to be true, but who would not wish his shut before they behold the tryall of the end? But euen now is not danger of thee to be feared in respect of warre daily threatned, which seemeth as a cloude to hang ouer thy head, and to darken the shining beames of thy Sunne which is thy Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne? Deale plainely, and thou wilt confesse with me, that thou hast long seene the cloude, but neuer felt the storme, for that by the heate of her princely power, it hath been so wasted from time to time, that onely a thinne mist thereof hath fallen vpon thee whereby thou art warned, the better to be
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>armed for thy defence. It doth whet thy courage, stirre vp thy mind, exercise thy body, encrease thy strength, teach thee to fight, and keepe thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from rust. So hast thou a tast of warre, but so, as it is no war vnto thee. Thou seest the shining of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, the glittering of swords, the marching of men, the running of horses: Thou hearest the sound of the Trumpet, and of the Drumme, the report of small and great shot, but how? thou seest the one with delight, thou hearest the other with pleasure, and griefe thou feelest of neyther; whereby terrible warre is delectable to thee, and that is fayre in thine eye which is nothing lesse thē faire in it self, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bellum,</hi> which hath in it <hi>nihil belli,</hi> as the cruell Sisters are named <hi>Parcae, quae nunquam parcunt,</hi> as if they did spare, which neuer doe spare any. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing the shew without the sence of warre, thou enioyest the fruite without the shew of peace, and reapest good of that, which of it selfe is ill. VVherein thy happinesse is farre the greater that through her care thou art secure, who watcheth that thou mayest sleepe, and holdeth warre out at the armes ende, that thine may finde theyr rest at home.</p>

So be thou well assured that when thou art most quiet, and suspectest least, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie danger approch thy Coasts, the eyes of thy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne are open to foresee, her head is busie to preuent all hurt which may befall thee.

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, her hope and help is in the Lord her God, who standeth at her right hand, giueth her victory, and worketh thy safety, to set forth his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. How much then art thou bound vnto her, and for her vnto God, that by the meanes of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, through the fauour of the highest, of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth thou art the most happy. If I seeke the world through, at this day I can finde none to compare vnto thee, and if I looke backe I can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie say

   </p>
   <p>And that can I say but in comparison of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines of that estate when it was quiet at home, and made warre abroade beyond the Alpes, and from it selfe on the other side the Sea.
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ammia. Marcell. lib.</hi> 14.</note> Then was it in the farthest parts knowne to be <hi>Regina gentium,</hi> the Queene of Nations, when at home by the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>entertaynment of all Strangers it was found to be <hi>Virtutum omnium domicilium,</hi> the receptacle of all vertues,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Vellerus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 2.</note> whose vertue had not vice supplanted, and driuen out of her gates, she had neuer within her owne walls embrewed her hands in her owne bowels. Let therefore the example of that famous Citty be an instruction and forewarning vnto thee. Be not couetous, ouer delicate and proud; spare not thy purse to keepe warre from thy dores; think thy bargaine great, if thou disburse the most of thy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to purchase thy peace. Thinke it not shame to thy men of aucthoritie to dye, not leauing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to bring their bodies to the graue, for so it was with <hi>Valerius Publicola,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Liui.

<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ammia. Mar.</hi> 14. <hi>Eutrop.</hi> 2.</note> as it happened to the wife of <hi>Regulus,</hi> then whom there neuer dyed Romaine with better mind to his Countrey, nor greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him selfe:
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ammia. Mar.</hi> 14.</note> neyther let it seeme much vnto thee, that the daughters of those which spend their liues in thy seruice be endowed out of thy treasury, as was the daughter of <hi>Scipio,</hi> the nobility of Rome pittying the long absence of her Father, and the losse of the flowre of her age. It was well with Rome when vertue with her was so embraced and
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>so rewarded. But when waxing proud, she wasted her wealth, in sumptuous buildings, superfluous feasts, and rich attire, wantonnes was in her streets, vice possessed her houses, and miserie soone after ouertooke her selfe. Be thou therefore at desiance with pride, forbeare all vanitie and superfluitie of expence. Know that houses are places to bayte in for a while, and not to abide in for euer, that they are prouided to serue necessitie, rather then to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish delicacie, and that for the common wealth much better it is that good hospitality be kept, then that faire houses be built. Remember also that men should eate to liue, not liue to eate, and that the throat being giuen but for a passage to the stomack, from whence to euery part nouriture is to be sent, for maintenance of the body, absurd and vile it is, for the throats onely pleasure, to burthen the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to weaken the body, to dull the minde, to empty the purse, and to shorten the life; none gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by a carcasse pampered, but wormes by which it shall be deuoured. Lastly thinke, how vaine the excesse of apparrell is, whereof the great varietie sheweth the extreame vanity of the people: all cost being lost, which is bestowed in the needlesse bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thereof. It serueth to effeminate the minds of men, to prouoke the lusts of the flesh, and to kindle pride in the hart, and causeth many to want in theyr olde age, which had too much in theyr youth; whose folly seemeth no lesse then theirs, which lade them selues with many clothes in the
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>Sommer, and for want goe naked in the VVinter. Of all these the vse is needefull, but hurtfull is the abuse, which being discouered is to be restrained in a well ordered common wealth. O that thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would consider this, and make profit thereof, in sparing from their bellies to feede the hungry, in sauing from their backes to cloath the naked: So should they abstaine from euill, and doo good, they should auoide the offence, and procure the fauour of Almightie God, and much more able should they be to serue thee for defence of them selues. Now here I seeme to heare thee say, that calling to minde what before hath beene sayed, of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall change and neuer resting course of the world, and finding thy selfe guiltie of those blemishes, wherewith the beauty of Rome was defaced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she fell, thou canst not but feare an alteration of thy fortune, &amp; think thou shalt resemble Rome heereafter in the dayes of her sorrow, as heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou hast done in her flourishing yeares. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me not but that all things of necessitie must alter, which are brought forth by nature, and I know that as in naturall bodies, so in the condition of men, of Townes, of Citties, and of all estates, there is a time of growth, and a time of decay, an houre to flourish, and an other to fade, seasons of pleasure which haue their termes, and turnes of griefe to succeede, when they are gone: so that the same oft-times are not yesterday and to day the same.</p>

   <p>I doubt not therefore but thou mayest be as Rome was, or as Fraunce is embrewed in thine owne blood, wounded with thine owne hand, and torne in peeces by thine owne strength, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inuaded and subdued by forraine power, as heertofore thy selfe hath been, especially the sinnes of thy people prouoking the wrath of thy God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. Yet giue me fauour to speake, and haue patience to heare what truly I shall say. Farre other thou art then Rome was when it fell to decay; that being set on fire by the burning ambition of great Potentates, <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla, Pompei</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> equall in power and in place, in degree and in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, hauing vnder them many to kindle, and not any ouer them to quench, the flame of their desire: which being insatiable became intollerable, and not being bridedled in time, could not be indured long of the common wealth. Neyther art thou like thy sister Fraunce whose territories are large, farre remoued from the eye of their King, whose Towns and Castels are many and strong, apt and easie to be held beeing surprised by seditious men; hauing neighbours at hand in loue with her beautie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying
<pb n="12" facs="11"/>her greatnes, desiring her spoyle, and both ready and able to assist her disobedient Subiects and vnnaturall children; and thy selfe, thy selfe doest resemble in no sort, thy present face being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the picture of thy former age. VVhen the winde of glory, vnder pretence to reuenge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, draue <hi>Caesar</hi> crosse thy Seas, thy name not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, by which now thou art knowne, no wonder if vnacquainted with armes, and naked without armour, thou gauest place at length to a mighty people,
<note place="margin">Romanes.</note> practised in warres, and led by the chiefe Commaunder of the world. VVhen distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by thy Northerne neere bordering neighbours, thou wert enforced to pray ayde for thy defence, and seeking friends,
<note place="margin">Saxons.</note> diddest foes entertaine to cut thine owne throat; how could it be thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est escape, thine enemies being strong in the field, and thou committing thy selfe to a faithlesse gard? who first by deceitfull beauty entrapped thy King, and after by open hostilitie possessed thy Crowne. VVhen thy bodie vvas parted into seauen partes which was but one, and had not one but manie heads, what strength, what direction couldest thou haue to withstand an vnited force of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies,
<note place="margin">Danes.</note> attempting with preparation, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing with resolution thine ouerthrowe? vvhile two of one name,
<note place="margin">Harold.</note> but of Nation diuers, contended for thy Scepter,
<note place="margin">Edgar.</note> a third being by force put from it, which of right should haue borne it,
<note place="margin">Norma.</note> oportunitie was giuen to set a conquering foote in thy troubled
<pb n="13" facs="11"/>Land, not vnlikely to be subdued being disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the wrong at home, and dismayed with the sodaine sight of an vnlooked for inuasion. So wast thou at a battaile well fought, and well followed, brought vnder the new yoake of a forraine Ruler,
<note place="margin">William Conque.</note> the ende of thy former toyle being the beginning of thy future woe. Since when, often times thou hast been a wofull spectacle to thine owne eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the fearefull face of ciuill warres, wasting thy fields, burning thy Townes, destroying thy people, and shedding the blood of the highest in aucthoritie ouer thee: which hath happened through the vniust gouernment of thy Rulers, the ambitious humor of thy Potentates, or the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous harts of thy Commons. But this now is not, nor hath been many yeares thy case. Thou art ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by law, agreeable to iustice, and executed with mercy, thy Soueraigne submitteth her selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that the greatest may not disdaine, and the meanest be willing, to obey her according to the same. Besides, thou art instructed in the knowledge of God, that of conscience thou shouldest perfome thy duty, both to him and her. If the weake be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, in her grace they finde reliefe, if the strong presume too farre, her Maiestie doth hold them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whereby it commeth to passe that eyther for conscience sake, or by force of gouernment, thou hast peace and knowest no warre at home. And that thou mayest be strong against foraine inuasion, thou art furnished with armes, and trayned to vse
<pb n="14" facs="12"/>them, many braue men hast thou practising the warres abroade, ready to returne when thou shalt neede them for thy succour, and so fast knit are the parts of thy body, the lower with the higher, all with the head, that thy strength is redoubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee. Thy body then being one, and thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in thine hand, hauing strength in thine armes, courage in thy hart, and wisedome in thy head, whom canst thou feare? what needest thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust? Although thou doest not shine with vertue without all staine of vice, though thou breedest and feedest weedes with thy Corne, some wicked amongst many good Children, yet if thy vice deface not thy vertue, if the weedes ouer-grow not the Corne, and the wicked doo not ouercome the good, thou hast no cause to suspect thine ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. So long as a disease take not the head, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse not the hart, nor runne through the whole body, there is great hope of cure, no daunger of death. The scarre of vice is not high in thy face, it standeth low, and serueth as a foile, set vnder to set forth the vertue of thy Queene, which is thy eye wherein thy beautie doth consist. Thy greatest wound is in thy inferiour parts, where, if it will not be cured, what is the worst.

   <p>If by the salue of mercie it cannot be healed, which often is, as often it should be applyed, by the sword of iustice it must be launced, that the sound
<pb n="15" facs="12"/>parts may be preserued, which course being held as it is held, so that the poyson of the wound, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster not too farre, thou mayest be assured that the Lord God which often spareth the wicked for the sake of the good, and neuer punisheth the iust for the faults of the vngodly will in mercy hold thee vp, that thou shalt not fall. VVhile thou art subiect to thy head, which is so carefull of thy health, that contempt of the maiestie of God she doth cut off, and will not suffer sinne, and iniquity, to grow vp within thee, thou art safe vnder her gouernment by his protection, from all thy enemies. As the mighty Oake fastened by the strength of his rootes, so doest thou stand fast, blow the wind where it shall, it shall but blow downe thy withered leaues. But that cannot euer be, what hath beene vnited must be dissolued, and nothing is more sure, then that the Sunne shall set which once doth rise, no man knowing how soone the brightnes thereof may be darkned with a cloud. That being true yet is it no lesse true, that as all Creatures were in their first creation, so are they all both in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and destruction, still subiect to the will of their Creatour: hee hath set them a race, which they cannot choose but runne, what he doth order, is not in their power to alter; neuerthelesse his own hand is not shortened, he is able to cut short, and to prolong, he can stop and turne the course how long, and which way his pleasure is.
<note place="margin">Iosu. 3, 4.</note> The waters of Iordan comming downe from aboue he stayed,
<pb n="16" facs="13"/>so as they rose vpon a heape, vntill the Priests bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the arke of the couenant, and all the Israelites went through Iorden,
<note place="margin">Iosua. 19.</note> and passed ouer dry. And when the Lord fought for Israell against the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, he stayed the Sunne in Gibeon, &amp; the Moone in the valley of Aialon, vntill the people auenged them selues of their enemies. So as the Sunne abode in the middes of the heauen, and hasted not to goe downe, for a whole day, and there was no day like that before it, nor after it. In like sort it is greatly to be hoped (which aboue all things with feruent prayer is to be desired) that the same God will stop the streame of whatsoeuer may hurt thy Soueraigns health, and stay the course of her life so long, that no health, no life, of any mortall Creature shall be like vnto hers, that shyning amongst the Princes of the earth, as the Sunne amiddest the starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, she may giue light and life vnto his church for a long while, &amp; be very late, if not the last, in going downe. No doubt as it was the pleasure of the omnipotent God to deliuer her out of the hands of her aduersaries in miraculous sort, and to rayse her to her princely seate ouer thee, and as of especiall and exceeding fauour, he hath in wonderfull wise euer sithence preserued her from the mischeeuous practises, and dangerous attempts of many enemies abroade, and at home, first that she might be, since for that she hath been, a careful nurse of his church, and tender mother of his children, and so hath blessed her with honour and riches, that her breasts
<pb n="17" facs="13"/>flow with milke, and her bones runne full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to the continuall feeding, and strengthning of his Gospell. So mayest thou be well assured, I speake what I hartily wish, and am verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, that good God by whom she now liueth and raigneth in Maiestie, will shew his power to the worlds wonder, in the length of her dayes, and glory of her kingdome, if for the rebellion of thy people against him, he take not her to him selfe, as more worthy to raigne with Angels in heauen, then to dwell with sinners, (wicked, and vnruly sinners, in denying God, and disobeying her) vpon earth. Beware therefore thou prouoke not the Lord thy God, by presumptuous sinnes to change his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to turne his face away from thee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that for the transgression of the Land there are many Princes thereof. Let thy people feare God, so shall they not feare the losse of her vnder whom, by his goodnes, infinit blessings they enioy, and thou art famous aboue all Nations. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem is fallen, and Iudah is fallen downe sayeth the Prophet, and why? because their tongue and works are against the Lord to prouoke the eyes of his glory. That which was sayed concerning Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem and Iudah, thinke to concerne thee, and know, that if thou committest the like fault, thou art like to feele the like smart, for he that spake it is one, and the same yesterday, to day, and for euer.
<note place="margin">Num. 23.</note> He is not as man, that he should lye, neyther as the Sonne of man, that he should repent. If thou cast behind
<pb n="18" facs="14"/>thee his goodnes,
<note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> if thou settest thy mouth against heauen, and not desiring the knowledge of his wayes, thou sayest out of the pride of thy hart, who is the Almighty that I should serue him?
<note place="margin">Iob. 22.</note> and what profit shold I haue, if I should pray vnto him? and because thou hast no changes,
<note place="margin">Psal. 55.</note> therefore thou doest not feare him. Thou shalt not onely dry vp the fountaine of his goodnes, and dew of his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, but shalt kindle the fire of his wrath to consume thee.
<note place="margin">Iere. 44.</note> So shall he take from thee thy stay and thy strength, and visite thy people as he visited Ierusalem, by the sword, by the famine, by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence: thy Citties shall be burnt with fire, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers shall deuoure thee in thy presence, and thou shalt be desolate. Thus farre hath loue which stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me vp, carried me on, and heere doth not suffer me to stay, but forceth me further to put forth the best strength I haue, whereby to remoue out of the minds of thy people, that heauy block of grosse ignorance, which may hinder them frō the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and hasten destruction to fall vpon them. For he not being by them honoured, they cannot be by him preserued, wherein before they can performe the least part of duty, they must know his being, beleeue in his power, and depend of his goodnes: which his being, power and goodnes, endeauoring to lay open, by the testimonie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason, and common sense of some, I may be thought to lacke both sence and reason; in that I labour to proue that which needeth no proofe,
<pb facs="14"/>and doo bring that into question, which is out of question, and cannot be doubted of. How that is it will appeare, but be it how so euer, it shall much more greeue me if my trauaile be fruitlesse, leauing any to whose hands it shall come ill perswaded, then repent me that it should be needelesse, finding all well instructed therein.</p>
