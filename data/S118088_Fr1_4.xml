                 <title>A short compend of the historie of the first ten persecutions moued against Christians : divided into III. centuries. Whereunto are added in the end of euery centurie treatises arising vpon occasion offered in the historie, clearely declaring the noveltie of popish religion, and that it neither flowed from the mouthes of Christs holy Apostles, neither was it confirmed by the blood of the holy martyrs who died in these ten persecutions</title>

   <p>IT was admired of old, that APHRAATES who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the cottages of the wildernesse al his time, yet once he was found in the streetes of <hi>Antiochia</hi> in the dayes of the Emperour VALENS, Theodor. hist. eccl. lib. 4. cap. 26. hee excufed the change of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer behauiour, by the similitude of a modest virgin lurking quietly in secret corners of her fathers house so long as it is in safetie, but if it bee set on fire, it is skaithfull modestie to lurke any longer, necessitie compelleth her to runne out to the streetes, to crie and giue warning of the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ill ofher fathers house. This example of APHRAATES might sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse mine vnaccustomed boldnesse to set foorth my head, that hath bene lapped vp so long in hurtfull si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But now the power of darknesse in creaseth, and as the Prophet saith, Woevnto vs, for the day declineth, and the shadowes of the euening are stretched out, Ierem. 6. 4. Yea the shadow of mount <hi>Athos</hi> reacheth to the Isle <hi>Lemnos,</hi> a sure fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning token of the going downe of the Sunne. Now it is time to creepe out of our subterraneall caues, and to giue warning to sloken the fire in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it spread further, and bring greater deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the House of our GOD. Papists are waxed insolent of late dayes, like vnto Serpentes in Summer weather taking courage and biting the heeles of horses, that the riders may fall, not sparing both in worde and write to reproach our religion, as a thing not countenanced with antiquitie, and our Ministrie as altogether naked and voyde of the knowledge of ancient learning. Shall wee

nowe stand as idle men doe in market places one looking vpon another? Rather then wee should sustaine such apparent dammage and skaith, through vntimous silence, I had rather step foorth with the Lacedemonian souldier impotent of his legges, and neither meete to fight, nor able to flie, yet had he this comfort that possible he might blunt the edge of his enemies sworde, and make others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed who were meeter for fighting then he was. Take in good season my weake trauelles, Christian Reader, I haue many honest witnesses who knowe that I was neuer purposed to send foorth vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen view of the world any thing that came from me. Howe this compend came into the Printers hande I remit vnto his faithful testimonie. It was my purpose, in write to haue giuen warning vnto noble houses who had bene my ordinarie auditors to beware of the contagion of lying doctrine, that is nowesecretly spreading in our land: this being done, the ordinarie exercises of my calling would haue beene my chiefe imployment, if the Lord pleased. Therefore [gentle Reader] take in the better parte the Goates haire, &amp; Rammes skinnes that I present to couer the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of my God. I referre the ornaments of gold, siluer and precious stones for beautifying the inner parts of the Tabernacle to others vpon whome God hath vouchsafed greater gifts, Exod. 25.</p>
