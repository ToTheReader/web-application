      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>OHN Fabritius Montanus,</hi> a man as it appeareth both ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and zelous, at what time this last generall Counsell was solemly proclamed and publyshed to be holden at Trent by thaucthoritie of the Pope, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such large placardes and priuileges of safeconduicte, for al nations to resorte thither, so formally by him sent abroad in euery quarter, and fearing lest emongest the people of God some such as were sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, might thereby easelye be entrapped, and vnder the glorious name of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges, fall into their enemies handes, thoughte it good yea to be his duetie also beynge him selfe a ministre of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of God, not onelye to publyshe to the christian worlde, that if they should ioine them selues with thys denne of theefes

and Sinagoge of Sathan where Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryst himself. <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>etteth as Iudge it should not be onelye perillous for theyr owne persons, but also contumeliouse to the maiestie of God, hurteful to theyr neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yea and iniuriouse to Gods truth. The whych thyng truly (in my opinion) he hath so fully, so eloquently, so compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouslye, and so sufficientelye done in this shorte oracion, that this onelye maye wel suffice to harnesse anye man agayne the subtil perswasions of oure aduersaryes, and to strengthen otherwyse the weake consciēces of Gods people, who thoughte it theyr bounden duetye, to be presente at suche assemblyes there to dyspute of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, or at the leaste wyse to propone or make protestacion of theyr saith. This oracion althoughe it were by Iohn <hi>Fabritius Montanus</hi> published in Latin, to al that vnderstode that tonge in due tyme before the councell was fullye assembled, so that thereby some fruit and commoditie was or myght haue been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof, yet I thou ghte it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnprofitable nowe also to translate the same into our Englishe tong to thend
<pb facs="3"/>
that such as are vnlearned and ignoraunt in thother may sée the censure and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this learned man, in this behalfe especially seing euen thunlearned of our aduersaries do so much at thys daye crye out for generall Councels, for the stablish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of religion, and geue so muche cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyte and aucihoritie to them as to the most holy worde of God.</p>
   <p>Take this (gentle reader) for the fyrste fruictes of my labour, vntyl suche tyme as God by hys heauenly dewe shall multyply and increase the same.</p>
