   <head>❧ The Authors Epistle.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had compiled (right honora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble) this litle treatise, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Manuel, conteyning the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of <hi>Pelops</hi> and <hi>Hyppodamia,</hi> with sundrie <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Sonets,</hi> (being none other in deede then such as at leisurable times hapned to my minde, and not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose inuented) I stoode in doubt whether I were better presume to publish this my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail, or in couert wise to keepe it close. At length I assured my selfe although it would bring but litle pleasure to the Readers if it were published, yet l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>sse would it be to any man if I kept it close. To this ende, to this point and issue I resolued my selfe for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and minded in deede to bring it to light But the while (as it were by a vision) another doubt and newe disturbance hapned to my minde, that for so much as by often reading and perusing of the same, I foūd my doings to be but rude, yea and as it were almost in vaine, I was in doubt I say, (right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) weighing and considering these enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, whether to set abroach this my newe wine, being but of ill colour, and worse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ast,
<pb facs="4"/>
vpon mine owne head, or mine owne aduen ture: seeing so manie serpents tongues redie in the waie, and the teeth of so manie bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dogs readie to bite: on the one side com meth <hi>Zoylus</hi> or <hi>Theogninus,</hi> and bring with them a railing rout of Sycophanticall brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: then thought I best on the other side to arme my selfe against these my mischieuous enemies with the title of some honorable, that might defend me from all such slaunde rous assaults. And seing that you by iust def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and noble parentage, are such a one as against whom I know for certainty by right such men cannot be by enuie moued, I am so bolde as vnder your shielde to publishe this my worke. Therefore these two thinges I craue of your honor, which both I trust of so gentle heart as heth within your breast shal not be denied. The one is this, that for so much as more boldlie then aduisedlie I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise vnder your name to shewe the skyll of my tender quill (being so small) I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire your Lordeship to pardon my rash do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And the other is this: for so much as this simple volume is geuen you of a meere good wil, I desire you to accept it as a token and none otherwise then it is in deede. To be praised or extolled aboue the merites of
<pb facs="4"/>
the same, I doe not desire. My paines herein taken I would not esteeme, so that I might obtaine the beneuolence of the readers: yet if it happen so that of the better sort I stand wel liked of, let <hi>Momus</hi> moppe and mowe, til I bid him staie. Thus trusting that this simple token you wil not despise, I ende, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing anie further to molest you, yet the while beseeching God to preserue you in <hi>Galens</hi> health: and in time to endue your Lordshippe with <hi>Nestors</hi> yeares, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> wealth.</p>
