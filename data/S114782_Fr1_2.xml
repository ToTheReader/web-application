   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE SIR THOMAS EGERTON Knight, Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England, and one of her Maiesties priuie Councell, my very good Lord: health and prosperitie, with the increase of grace in this life, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happines in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>On datur beneficium nisi propter officium,</hi> saith a learned Father. Wherefore hauing performed this small part of my dutie in the house of God, now at last I am bold to offer it to your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, first as a signe of my dutie for your good Benefice in Suffolke lately bestowed vpon me, and secondly for patronage. For whereas since my going into Suffolke, by meanes of some of my friends I was discouered to my enemies in the flesh, but not in the Lord, to be the author of this booke, which at the first came forth like a fatherlesse orphan: vnworthily I was cast vpon the obloquie of all men (they seeing in me nothing worthie of this meanenes) and behinde my backe was bought and sold for a vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man. Thus while I shunned the title of vaineglorie, and would not be like those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, which (as <hi>Tully</hi> saith) put their names to the bookes which they make in contempt of glory; ere I wist, as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>the thing which
<pb facs="3"/>
I feared fell vpon me.</hi> Notwithstanding ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king patience for my buckler, and a cleare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for my defence, I satisfied my selfe, though I could not satisfie mine aduersaries. Now so it is come to passe, that all the first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse edition is spent, and the vertuous call vpon the Printer, and the Printer calles vpon me for a second presse, exhorting me to make some addition or correction if I were so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that so it might come forth the second time with a happier successe. The which thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing performed according to my weake mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I am bold to present it to your Lordships patronage, to couer my simplenes vnder the shadow of your wing, and to craue protection both for the worke and my selfe: which if your Lordships fauour shall vouchsafe, you shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a poore Minister beginning at low steps to ascend higher in religious duties: the young infants which as yet sucke vpon their mothers breasts shall thanke God for you, and my selfe shall be alwaies bound to pray for you.</p>
