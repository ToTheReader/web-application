and courtly curtesie at home; and (which most is of all) your feruent zeale according to knowledge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the glorious Gospell of Christ, were causes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or rather vehemently thrusting me on, by this meanes and in this sort, dutifully to attempt your Honorable patience. Of such force is true Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, accompanied with hir proper adiuncts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested with hir peculiar titles, that she draweth all men into the loue and admiration of hir. So that all men to their incredible comfort do ioyfully note and euidently behold the liuely image and expresse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of that Mirror of Nobilitie, your late most magnificent father, brightly shining in you his sonne: being like ynough (through Gods good fauor, mercifully finishing that, which he hath alreadie graciously and richly begun in you) if not in ech point to surmount, (which is scarcely possible) yet at least to match (which is most Honorable) his martiall seruices, valorous prowesse, woorthie attempts, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous exploits, inuincible courage, renoumed boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and most noble generositie.</p>
   <p>The troupe therefore of Vertues, deliuered vnto your Honor (as it were by hand) from your so noble a Parent, and togither with the hereditarie succession of his lands, left, and (by nature) lineally descended vnto you, was the Loadestone, that mightily drew me, being a rude lumpe of vnwrought Yron, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your excellent graces: and by such meanes as I am able, to testifie this my zealous loialtie toward so Honorable a Gentleman, so rare a Peere, so sure a Botreaux vnto his Countrie, &amp; so pretious a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon of perfect Nobilitie.

which I then translated out of Latine into English, in my natiue Countrie of <hi>Chesshyre,</hi> and dedicated vnto the Right Honorable, my singular good Lord, the Baron of Cobham.</p>
   <p>Receiue now therefore (Right Honorable) into your protection and patrociny, these my poore labors▪ and if they seeme woorthie, shrowd them from the criticall doome of waiwarde Wranglers and surly Areopagites, that without looking into my intent, will perhaps be busie ynough to condemne mine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
