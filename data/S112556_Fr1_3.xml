not a litle encourage me, to publishe this poore peece of woorke of mine (which is so simple, that it is scant worthie to appeare in print) and also I am the more bolde to let it show the face, because I hope that the good and godly will gratefully accept the same, if it be but onely because it is some testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my good will which I beare towardes them.

All which did thankefully accept these simple gyftes, nothing respecting the giftes, but the good will of the giuer. Whose examples, hoping the godly will followe, in receiuing this simple gift of mine, I pray instantly vnto the Lorde God almightie, that it woulde please his diuine maiesty, to finish that good worke which hee hath begun in them, and that he will dayly increase in them that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst, which they haue after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, so shall they be sure to be satisfied in the life to come, with the fruition of those
