         <hi>Greenham Perkins. Rogers. Downam, and Arthur Dent, &amp;c.</hi>
      </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent treatises and larger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power of godlinesse, which it hath pleased the Lord of glory to furnish his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in these later daies, as they haue made good the faithfulnes of our God vno vs of our Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp; therein auouched against all schismaticall spirits, that yet there is an holy seed among vs: so if they shall not bee a witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, doe they necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb facs="6"/>
in the right vse thereof, that we be transformed into the same image from glory to glory. And therfore howsoeuer it may seeme both needlesse, and preiudiciall, after so many graue, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall rules concerning sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to adde any more in this kinde: yet seeing it hath pleased God to direct mee to a further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein: weigh with me I pray thee in equitie these reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</p>
   <p>First, I doe hereby professe my thankefulnesse vnto God for those excellent labors of his Saints, that now rest from their labours and their fruits follow them.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I would haue thee know that I am not ashamed of this foolishnesse of preaching, and practicke Diuinitie, which is such a mystery to the world, and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke vnto the wisedome thereof.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, howsoeuer I do professe that I am not able to attaine such perfection, as I haue here in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb facs="6"/>
yet I would haue thee know further, that I would rather haue a rule to condemne sinne in the flesh, and so to confound the old man, that thereby the new man may follow hard after the marke: then not to giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to that light, which hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so gratiously vnto me, then to conceale my iudgement, though it may condemne my practise.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, May it please thee to consider with me: Can a man walk in the Sunne, and not bee warme, and where two lie together, will there not be heate? and can the light be hidden, nay, ought it to be hidden? Ought we not, being conuerted, conuert our brethren: doth not the light shine vnto vs, and can we hold our peace? Is not the night coming fast on vs when none can worke?</p>
   <p n="5">5 Can wee doe lesse in these dayes, then conuince a prophane world?</p>
   <p n="6">6 Can we do better, then streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that which is ready to die?</p>

purging and triall. And is it not more then high time that wee should gather our selues before the decree come forth? Is it not certain that our master wil not lōg deferre his comming and shall not that seruant be blessed, whom his master comming shall finde so doing, euen freeing himselfe and departing from euill. Shal not the wise man see the plague and hide himselfe, &amp; the foole run on &amp; be punished? Shall not the wise vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins prepare oyle in their lampes to meete the Bridegrome, whiles stripes are preparing for the back of the scorner? Behold then the oyle that thou must bee furnished withall. Shall not this be thy store house dayly to furnish thee with meanes whereby thou must walke fruitfully with thy God, in ech du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thy calling, whereby thou maist entertaine each seuerall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion chearefully, that so while thou hast the light, thou maist walke in it, that so thou maist bee found in peace at thy masters
<pb facs="7"/>
comming. Doe the times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in regard of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of plentifull meanes, that by this time thou shouldest haue bin a teacher of others, and yet art thou to learne the grounds of thy faith? Behold here then the grounds of Sanctification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and opened vnto thee: that thou maist be soundly entred into the schoole of Christ Iesus, that thou maist trie thy selfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hast laide a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or no? hast thou built hay and stubble vpon the foundation? hast thou gone a stray from that perfect rule, and therefore hadst need to returne backe againe?</p>
   <p>Behold, <hi>The doctrine of repentance</hi> to sustaine thy iudgement aright: here maist thou trie thy selfe, whether thou hast repented or no, hereby maist thou approue thine interest in Iesus Christ. And to this purpose is <hi>the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> proposed before the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith. Not that it is or can be in nature before it: for how can
<pb facs="8"/>
the fruite be before the tree? can we loue God vnlesse hee loue vs first? can wee forsake our sinnes, vnles the loue of Christ constrain vs? must we not beleeue sinne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable before we can forsake it: Is not our sufficiencie of God through Iesus Christ to subdue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquitie? Is not Iesus Christ aswel-the authour and finisher of our faith? And is it not sinne before God, though it seeme neuer so glorious among men, whatsoeuer is not of faith? And without faith is it possible to please God? Must we not first be in Christ before we can be new creatures? and do we not liue by faith in the Sonne of God? And doth not the death of Christ daily kill sinne in vs? doe wee not dayly rise vp in him to newnesse of life? And do wee not approue our selues hereby liuing members of his body? Is it any more wee but Christ that now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in vs? Is not this to liue by faith in the Sonne of God? Loe here our repentance being a fruit
<pb facs="8"/>
of our faith in Iesus Christ, is also an euidence vnto our soules, that we are in the faith: and so our faith which in nature is before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath, yet repentāce in order accōpanying the same, and by this liuely fruit is discerned of vs: and thus hast thou in the next place a gratious direction how to <hi>discerne</hi> and <hi>reuiue</hi> thy most pretious faith that so thou maist bee sure that thou hast not laboured in vaine.</p>
   <p>Now seeing the work of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is begun in weaknes, rather in the purpose of the heart, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny constancie of outward practise, and hypocrisie wil be sure to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it selfe with our best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours if it be possible to blast the the verie blade.</p>
   <p>Therefore art thou informed in the next place how to <hi>prepare</hi> thy heart in the seruice of God, how to comfort thy selfe in the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, notwithstanding thy dayly failings in the practise of weldoing.</p>
   <p>And seeing the heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful aboue al things, &amp; the cause
<pb facs="9"/>
of all thy failings ariseth from the not guiding of thy heart. Therfore art thou taught how to <hi>arme</hi> thy heart with that <hi>complete armor of a Christian souldier.</hi> And so thou art instructed in the vse of each <hi>seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peece</hi> therof, that so thou maist be ready at all assayes.</p>
   <p>To this end in the next place are propounded vnto thee, those two maner occasions and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy whole life: namely, to prosecute good, and forsake euill: and so thou art instructed how to performe the one, and leaue the other, how to discerne sinceritie in either.</p>
   <p>And because the true Christian life is a continuall growth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou further informed how to discerne this growth in grace, thou art furnished with meanes, wherby thou maist grow, and thou art comforted in the weakenesse and hinderances of thy growth.</p>
   <p>And seeing <hi>thankefulnesse</hi> is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial badge of our loue vnto Christ &amp; a principal means to renue our
<pb facs="9"/>
right in him, that so from him we may renue strength and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of grace to grow forward perfection: therefore art thou taught also <hi>how to bee thankefull,</hi> thou art informed in the truth and right vse of this dutie.</p>
   <p>And as by these meanes thou art hastning to perfection: so art thou further prouoked to <hi>constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> &amp; <hi>perseuerance.</hi> And gratiously informed how thou maist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in thy greatest fayling that thou shalt recouer, but instructed also gratiously how thou maist hold out. Namely,</p>
   <p>By holy <hi>watchfulnesse,</hi> and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie ouer thy heart and wayes, that so thou maist preuent securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and presumption, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously goe on and perseuere in weldoing.</p>
   <p>And that thou maist not bee ouercome with the cares of the world, not be to seeke at any time of the present assistance of thy God: therefore thou art enformed
<pb facs="10"/>
aboue all things to <hi>make thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests manifest vnto God,</hi> and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so to aske that thou maist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
   <p>And so thou art informed how to maintaine <hi>thy peace with God,</hi> and to repose thy selfe sweetly in the bosome thereof.</p>
   <p>And m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ist thou not also learne hereby how to beginne the day with God.</p>
   <p>Art thou not instructed how to sanctifie thy family by holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, how to sanctifie the occasiōs by holy and feruent prayer.</p>
   <p>Art thou not directed how to walke in thy calling? art thou not comforted in the issue there of.</p>
   <p>Art thou not further informed in the right vse of thy diet, that so thou maist eat to liue, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>e to the glory of thy maister.</p>
   <p>Art thou instructed how to cloth thy selfe outwardly, that thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man may stil be decked with grace and holinesse: that thou maist be better fitted to that cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpon?</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>And seeing thou art naturall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable, and must of necessitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse with others, therefore art thou also taught how to choose and vse company, that so thou maist not returne vnto them, but cause them to returne vnto thee. And seeing thou must haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sometimes to be alone, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou directions how to be solitarie, that so thou maist ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be excluded the protection of thy God.</p>
   <p>In a word, what estate canst thou be in, wherein thou shalt hence learne true contentment how to behaue thy selfe in euery change how to raise profite to thy selfe from euery alteration.</p>
   <p>Art thou in <hi>prosperitie,</hi> and so hast need of humbling to preuent pride of wisedome, to manage thy estate, wise by that thou maist lay vp a good foundation thereby against the day of Christ. Make vse then in the name of God of what to this end is here stored vp for thee, and the Lord giue thee
<pb facs="11"/>
vnderstanding all things.</p>
   <p>Art thou in <hi>Affliction</hi> and hast neede of comfort to vphold thee, of patience to leade thee through the extremitie thereof, obserue then what is here commended to thee for this vse, and thou shalt blesse God that hee hath accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee worthy to suffer with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</p>
   <p>Hast thou still neede of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of thy God? hast thou <hi>an account</hi> to make for others, as well as for thy selfe? And is thy life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine? thou knowest not when thou shalt be called, and therfore it stands vpon thee to bee readie vpon euery call. Take here then thy direction how to order thy family by that perfect rule that so thou maist giue vp a chearefull account for them. And learne here how to make vp thine owne reckoning wisely, that so when thy maister commeth thou maist be found ready. And canst thou then desire more then to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to thy maisters ioy. And shall not
<pb facs="11"/>
thou be euer furnished for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of thy best desires. O then praise God for his mercie that hath renued &amp; incresed vnto thee this light, and increase thy prayers vnto God for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our common light, that in this light thou maist still see light, and be prepared and hereby translated from this light of grace vnto that light of glory, to raigne with Iesus Christ in eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, to whose blessed protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I doe most heartily commend thee, And so do rest</p>
