   <head>To The Reader.</head>
   <p>EXspectest thou from hence a matter beautified with Learned phrayses, or adorned with Scholler like tearmes, thy expectation is frustrated: grapes may not be had from a thorny hedge. Reader, in this insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vollomne, the writer chiefely desires to manifest the true proceedings of a matter not truly, not faithfully, nor yet not wisely carried. The takeing in of <hi>Saluedoe</hi> in <hi>Brasile</hi> by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the giuing of it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by vnderstandlesse and cowardly Officers: a rumour of which hath ben hard of in all parts of Christendome, and in particular in <hi>England.</hi> part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath ben truth, but another part vntruth; for parties in their owne cases are commonly parshall, as some in this thing hath ben: if an officer of <hi>Bay should write of</hi> this matter, souldiers of the same place would say he writ to lesson (if not to nullifie) officers faults and false dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if a souldier should take in hand the discouery of all the proceedings in these affaires, presently would the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders say, enuy (not loue to his Countrey) did stir him vp to write, what the souldiers would haue goe for truth, not what is truth indeed; if any should write hereof that hath not ben eye witnesse of all things that hath ben passed, he might vnwitingly and vnwillingly write contrary to the truth, I being not on officer in <hi>Saluedoe,</hi> let not any thinke I haue masked the matchlesse basenesse of these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: nor being a souldier I may not bee suspected to haue drawne a curtaine before the condemned faults of souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I haue not beene a stranger to these things, that any should challenge me of ignorance, but I haue en an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all things from the going out of the Fleete from
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Taxsel</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which went forth the <hi>13</hi> of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>1623,</hi> till our comming forth from Bay the <hi>18</hi> of Iuly <hi>1625.</hi> And further to take away all suspition of dubble dealing in my proceedings concerning the officers, I doe vnfainedly acknowledge, that I haue ben aboue my cauling respected of all the officers, and most kindly and friendly vsed of them all, so small is my hatred to them, that I could wish (with a prouiso) that they were in the like hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red estate as I haue seene them in <hi>Saluadoe.</hi> Beloued Countreymen, I doe ass in the presence of God intend to write the true proceedings of the Brasilian Voyage, not feareing the frownes or yet the fury of base officers: onely I desire that all that reades will not be curious in prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the manner of my writing, for I know it is faulty: I see it my selfe, how then may it appeare faulty to iudissiall iudgements: to goe to amend it will require as much time and paines as to make a new one: and if I should so doe I should still make my apologie to excuse my faults: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is I send it forth, desiring thee good Reader is beare with small faults: and leaue the grater to my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, so I leaue thee to wisdomes direction, and the Lords protection,</p>
