to the Prince
<hi>ELECTOR,</hi> being hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepar'd, as from eager
hearts that could delay no Ceremony
that might render an expression of their
Loves: Jt could not be, but I must share
the inconvenience of that hast: since
length and aptitude of time is still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to these Composures: And this
(devis'd and written in three dayes)
might happely have found an excuse,
if the presentation had beene as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
perform'd, as it was prepar'd: but
<pb facs="3"/>
there was a sad necessitie for the delay;
and J may justly stile it a misfortune,
that the generall worke could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit of alteration by that
unprofitable leasure, which since we have
rather lost than enjoy'd. Though some
Truthes are not conveniently urg'd, this
J was forc'd to say in a malignant time,
when most men strive to raise themselves
a reputation of witt, by Cavill and
Dislike.</p>
