   <head>G.VV. In prayse of Gascoigne, and his Posies.</head>
   <l>REader rewarde nought else, but onely good report,</l>
   <l>For all these pleasant Posies here, bound vp in sundrie sort.</l>
   <pb facs="13"/>
   <l>The flowers fayre and fresh, were set with painefull toyle,</l>
   <l>Of late in <hi>Gascoignes</hi> Garden plot, a passing pleasant soyle.</l>
   <l>Now weedes of little worth, are culde from out the rest,</l>
   <l>VVhich he with double paine, did work, to gleane the bad frō best,</l>
   <l>The state is very straunge, and fortune rare in vse,</l>
   <l>VVhose heauie happe he neither helpes, nor blazeth their abuse.</l>
   <l>In thundring verse he wrayes, where highest mindes be thrall,</l>
   <l>VVhere mischeefe seekes to rayse it selfe, by force of others fall</l>
   <l>He pluckes the visour of, from maskes of peeuish pride,</l>
   <l>And wrayes what sowre (in sweet pretēce) the coustly corts cā hide.</l>
   <l>In euerie gallant flower, he setteth forth to show,</l>
   <l>Of <hi>Venus</hi> thralles, the hap, the harme, the want, the weale, the woe.</l>
   <l>He finely findes their faultes, whose welth doth foster wrong,</l>
   <l>VVho toucheth sinne (without offence) must plainly sing his song.</l>
   <l>His loftie vaine in verse, his stately stile in prose,</l>
   <l>Foretelles that <hi>Pallas</hi> ment by him, for to defende hir foes.</l>
   <l>VVherwith to <hi>Mars</hi> his might, his lustie limmes are knit,</l>
   <l>(A sight most rare) that <hi>Hectors</hi> mind, should match with <hi>Pallas</hi> wit.</l>
   <l>By proofe of late appeared (how so reportes here ran)</l>
   <l>That he in field was formost still, in spoyle the hynmost man.</l>
   <l>No backward blastes could bruse the valour of his thought,</l>
   <l>Although slie hap, forestoode his hope, in that he credite sought.</l>
   <l>In fortunes spight he straue, by vertues to aspire,</l>
   <l>Resolude when due deserts might mount, then he should haue his hire</l>
   <l>Thus late with <hi>Mars</hi> in field, a lustie Souldiour shewde,</l>
   <l>And now with peace in <hi>Pallas</hi> schoole, he freendly hath bestowde,</l>
   <l>On thee this heape of flowers, the fruites of all his toyle,</l>
   <l>VVhereof if some but simple seeme, consider well the soyle.</l>
   <l>They grew not all at home, some came from forreyne fieldes,</l>
   <l>The which (percase) set here againe, no pleasant sauour yeeldes.</l>
   <l>Yet who mislyketh most, the worst will hardly mend,</l>
   <l>And he were best not write at all, which no man will offend.</l>
