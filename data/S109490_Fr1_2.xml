   <head>¶ To all that can write and reade and cast accompt, the Translator.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please you: To bee a foole in Print, is as ordinarie, as a foole at an Ordinarie; and therefore t'were no good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship to breake companie. Tis a Proverb, The child thats borne must be kept, though't be a bastard, seeing tis murder by the law to make away even the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully begotten. If the rugged cadence of this Verse, and scurrile harshnesse of this subiect, doe chance to escape a murdring censure <hi>(Quod Dij pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us omen in ipsum)</hi> If: then the Translator vowes to conclude, that either Signior <hi>Malevole</hi> his sure of Gumme is fretted out at elbowes, and hee put to the naked shift of keeping his chamber (tis well he hath a chamber;) or at least the subiect of this Booke is entertained with such abiection, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction like your breath-broaker in a Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vacation can find no subiect to worke vpon. Many a man may <hi>Petere sibi simile,</hi> that intends not <hi>Procreare sibi simile,</hi> may take a snatch and away,
<pb facs="3"/>
that would be loth to be tied to racke and manger, or passe billes of sope and candle. Tis my case: Who, though in the minority of my grammar-schollership, I was induced by those, whom du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie might not withstand, to vnmaske these Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manners, and put them on an English face; notwithstanding, witnesse my native bashfull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, how distant it ever was from my desires; nay, how I ever feard to be pressed to death, by the publike censure of those, who (as I have heard) have it by Patent to scandalize whatsoever vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes the publike Presse. The truth is, this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation was halfe Printed ere I knew who had it: So that <hi>Quo fata trahunt,</hi> without prevention or correction the fooles bolt must needes be shot. And this is it. Those which mislike the verse in English, let them reade it in Latine (for I allowe no mislikers, vnlesse at least they can reade Latin) &amp; then perhaps thei'le wonder that a man of such wisedome as my Author, being neyther borne a Roman, nor a <hi>Naso,</hi> should with such confidence of a generall applause publish so elaborate a trifle: from which admiration of yours, I hope your curtesie will derive a miracle viz. my pardon, especially considering that both <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Virgill</hi> (both Poets Laureat) have beene metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into as indigest and breathlesse a kind of verse
<pb facs="3"/>
as this. All that I can say for my Author, is, hee speakes broad English, but by contraries: all for myselfe, is, tis a Punies translation onely, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, howsoever (fathered vpon me, because I taught him English, yet begotten without my presence, borne before my witte, and published against my will, vnlesse wee may be saide to will what we can not prevent. So fare ye well, and I pray picke as much matter out of this Epistle, as may be,</p>
