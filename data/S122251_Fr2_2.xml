   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T pleased you to put me upon the translation of the Lord of <hi>Praissac's discourses,</hi> and (afterwards) of this last piece of his; which I conceive he intended, as a <hi>Corollarium</hi> to conclude with; or as an <hi>Epitome</hi> of his other tractes, to put his readers to trie what they had profited by them, by setting these wheels awork. These are no speculations for every <hi>Tyro</hi> to meddle with; but rather for such as had followed your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie self in your foure and twentie years <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> (in <hi>Denmark, Germanie,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries</hi> and elsewhere) to exercise their thoughts in; and to recollect those things which might (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) be slipped out of memorie. I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this piece to any thing better (for so much matter in so small a room) then to that admired artificiall <hi>Flie,</hi> made by that famous <hi>German Joan. De monte regio,</hi> (celebrated by divine <hi>du
<pb facs="110"/> Bartas</hi>) which (not exceeding a naturall fly in bignesse) contained such wheels, springs, and other engines, as made it fly from the artists hand round about a table, and so to his hand again. As little as this piece is, (and my pains in it the least that may be) yet I am confident (having so much experience of your true can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and sweet disposition) you will dain to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, from</p>
