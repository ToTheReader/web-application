      <hi>The Argument of the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Paule the Apostle to the Romanes, takē out of the bokes of Athanasius Biship of Alexandria.</head>
   <p>THey be called Paules Epistles bicause he wrote them. And by them he both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth and correcteth those whom he had seene and taught: and also laboreth to teach them the same things whom he had not sene, as they may perceiue which light vpon thē. This to the Romanes he wrote from Corinth, at what time he had not yet seene them, but yet had herd of their faith, and was desirous to see them. And first of all he prayseth their faith which he herd spoken of euerywhere. Then doth he them to vnderstande, that he had purposed to come to thē for the good will that he bare them, but hitherto could not. Howbeit he frameth his Epistle after a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="27"/> of teaching, informing them of the calling of the Gentiles, and that circumcision serued but for a time, &amp; was now abolished, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams trāsgression was discharged by Christ, &amp; that the shadow of the Law was vanished away. Therfore that the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles was done consequently in good order, he prouth in this wise. He sheweth that the law is grafted in all men, and that any man may know God euen of his own mother wit by the creation and state of things, without the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Law written. And therefore he doth worthely first of all blame the Gentiles, that wheras God hath opened the knowledge of himselfe vnto them by the works of the world, and therwith also shewed them his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting power, which is his worde, wherin and wherby he made all things. They consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not by the creatures, that God was the workmaster of such things, but rather ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed godhead to his creatures, and worshipped them, rather than the maker of them. Also he blameth the Iewes, for that they had not kept the Law, but rather dishonored God by breaking the Law. And so he rebuketh both parts, aswell Iewes as Gētiles, &amp; shetteth thē vp vnder the iniquity of trāsgressiō, to shewe
<pb facs="28"/> that all men are made felowlike, and alike gyltie, and that they haue neede of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Agayne, that there was iust cause of the calling of the Gentiles, he sheweth by this that grace and redemption ought to befall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like both to the Iewes and to the Gentiles, and that when the Gentiles were called, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the shadowe of the Lawe did of necessitie ceasse. For Abraham (sayth he) beeing iustified, not in Circumcision, but before Circumcision, was named Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, bicause it should come to passe that he should be made the father of many Nations, according to the fayth which he had when he was vncircumcised. And after that he was iustified, he receiued circumcision in his flesh, as a signe to his ofspring that shoulde be borne of him as concerning the flesh, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision should ceasse when the Gentiles should become the children of Abraham, &amp; begin to liue according to Abrahams fayth, wherethrough he was iustified when he was yet vncircumcised. For whereas he was called Abram before: in respect of these things he was nowe called Abraham. And it was requisite that the signe should ceasse, when the things that were betokened by it
<pb facs="28"/> were come. Wherefore if any body compell the Gentiles to be Circumcised, they must of necessitie bothe take from him the name of Abraham, and call him Abram. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was named Abraham by God, the Gentiles must not bee circumcised, neither must the Jewes haue the foreskin of their flesh cut of, to the intent that the name Abraham may abide stedfast, and he be called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations. For it is not to be borne with hereafter, that any man should be circumcised, seeing that the fayth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham suffiseth, and there is no neede of any shadowe of the Lawe. For no man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by such things, but by fayth as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was. When he hath proued these things after this fashion, he sheweth agayne that neither Israell nor the Gentiles can obteyne redemption and grace by any other meanes than by beeing quit of that auncient and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sinne that is spred into all men by Adam. But that can not be wiped away by other than by the sonne of God, by whome also the curse was made from the beginning. For it was not possible that any other body should discharge that trespasse. Afterward he writeth, that that thing was not done by
<pb facs="29"/> any other meanes, than that the sonne of God tooke fleshe vpon him, and became man, that he might deliuer all men from death, by offering vp the same body for all, which was subiect to the same sufferings that wee bee. And like as by one man sinne entred into the worlde, so also by one man grace came vpon all men. From thēcefoorth as a good steward he comforteth the Jewes, telling thē that they shall not be transgressers of the Law, if they beleeue in Christ, and warneth suche of the Gentiles as beleeued, that they should not be puffed vp agaynst the Israelites, but consider that as the boughes are grafted into a tree, so were they grafted into the Jewes. When he hath finished these things, he addeth exhortations to good maners, and so endeth his Epistle.</p>
