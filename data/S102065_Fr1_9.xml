         </gap>e l'me halfe Atheist now: sure vertues are,</l>
      <l>Only well temperd bodies kept with care.</l>
      <l>For when I see this Passions seat i'th' heart:</l>
      <l>And a receipt against all Cupids art:</l>
      <l>Lov's arrowes so to th' publike view displaid</l>
      <l>That wee can see which burnes, which dulls a Maid;</l>
      <l>And how: what is the Poison he does give,</l>
      <l>And then againe what's the restorative.</l>
      <l>Sure wee must hither come our armes t' unfold,</l>
      <l>To look upright, and like our Sexe bold.</l>
      <l>Sweet Mistresse pray put on. I am resolv'd</l>
      <l>To laugh, being safe amongst these leaves involv'd.</l>
      <l>Whilst J doe read and Meditate this book,</l>
      <l>I dare the utmost Charmes of any Look.</l>
      <l>Nay I could gaze eu'n on <hi>Castara's</hi> face</l>
      <l>And nere be blind nay Kisse her if she was</l>
      <l>Here, yet nere perish for't, still be a man,</l>
      <l>Not scorcht to ashes drier then her fanne.</l>
      <l>With a too neer approach forsooth her beams</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="14"/>
That gilds as shee walks by the glittering streams.</l>
      <l>If she would part, Farewell: when she is gone</l>
      <l>Methinks I now should live, nere turn'd to stone.</l>
      <l>If she should surfet on a Tart orort so,</l>
      <l>And overcharg'd to bed at Midday goe;</l>
      <l>J should nere light a candle, as if twere night</l>
      <l>Pray her to rise that we might see the light.</l>
      <l>When we were in the darke, Jde hardly say,</l>
      <l>After my shinnes were broke it was noon day.</l>
      <l>Nor when some spittle hung upon her lip.</l>
      <l>Should J avouch 'twas Nectar, and then sip.</l>
      <l>Now I have read this book, methinks one might</l>
      <l>Enjoy the spring both in the smell, and sight,</l>
      <l>Though she were ith' Exchange a buying knots,</l>
      <l>Or with her Taylor there contriving plots</l>
      <l>For a new Gowne, and had no time to dresse</l>
      <l>The Meadows with her looks, and so farre blesse</l>
      <l>The Country, as be present for to deck</l>
      <l>The ground with lilies dropping from her neck.</l>
      <l>I'de not mistake her cheeks for Gardens, sweare</l>
      <l>There were no Roses in the world, but there.</l>
      <l>If I now fluent were as th' Innes of Court,</l>
      <l>My. Musc should here run out to make her sport.</l>
      <l>Nor would I write o'th' thorn that knew the charm</l>
      <l>A Beauty has, when't did her foot no harme.</l>
      <l>For <hi>Venus</hi> coud not scape a wound, yet this</l>
      <l>A Brighter <hi>Venus</hi> see how whole she is.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="15"/>
None now shall travaile up into the skies</l>
      <l>For a huge Metaphor for her dazling eyes.</l>
      <l>Gallants shall thinke that there's a Sun ith sky,</l>
      <l>As well as that in their bright Ladies eye.</l>
      <l>Nor shall they henceforth whine in Rime, because</l>
      <l>His Mistresse spoke doubtfully ith' last clause.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Study your glasse you wantons, till you be</l>
      <l>Shrunke to as perfect shadows as you see.</l>
      <l>Pray' doe more scarlet on your Cheeks consume,</l>
      <l>Then Iudges weare; so that we may presume</l>
      <l>Your faces at the drapers cost you more</l>
      <l>Then your large wardrops, throngd with fruitful store.</l>
      <l>The next time you come forth, perhaps I'le say</l>
      <l>Tis a good picture, or well plasterd Clay.</l>

      <l>Those that raile at it five houres by the glasse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This work shall our affections so refine,</l>
      <l>That we shall here in vertue, like Gods, shine,</l>
      <l>Stews hence forth shall be sanctuaries, and</l>
      <l>All the Balconies honest in the <hi>Strand.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Templars</hi> shall goe to plaies, and never see</l>
      <l>Whores besides those that are i'th Comoedy.</l>
      <l>The cost they should bestow in buying gownes,</l>
      <l>Fans, Knots, and Gloves, shall hence forth purchase Townes.</l>
      <l>Honest recreations now shall Heirs please,</l>
      <l>Be Drunke, see Plaies, and Game at Ordnaries.</l>
      <l>The Poxe' meng these shall be a Scandall now,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="15"/>
As much as that they deem to hold the plough.</l>
      <l>They shall contented be to ride ith' street,</l>
      <l>Without a bed fellow ith' Coach to greet.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If I cou'd venter <hi>Bookers</hi> haplesse fate,</l>
      <l>And durst but Prophesy after his rate,</l>
      <l>Amongst the dearths I woud produce the feare</l>
      <l>I have, e're long Women will cease to beare.</l>
      <l>The World will all turne Stoicks, when they find</l>
      <l>This Physick here: think only with the mind</l>
      <l>T'engender, alwaies judging th' issue foule,</l>
      <l>Which did not owe its birth to th' purer soule.</l>
      <l>Then we must feare the Worlds supply: be faine</l>
      <l>T'entreat <hi>Deucalion</hi> to throw stones againe.</l>
      <l>The Country Gentlemen will quite lay by</l>
      <l>Their English <hi>Plutarchs,</hi> to read here, and cry</l>
      <l>Wou'd their names perish't had, so they had took</l>
      <l>This Authors Counsell, living by his book:</l>
      <l>And turning from their Wives, shall e' en give ore</l>
      <l>The Husbands office, and beget no more.</l>
      <l>Nay Tribute then in Children will be told,</l>
      <l>A Progeny shall be our tax, not Gold.</l>
      <l>Shortly to Church to see a wedding goe,</l>
      <l>Shall to the People prove a Lord-Majors show.</l>
      <l>Men, as in Plagues, from Marriage will be bent.</l>
      <l>And every day will seem to be in Lent.</l>
      <l>There will no Matches be, but in <hi>Last Acts:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>When that the Poets strength of wine contracts.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="16"/>
The Priest will loose his fees, and lacke; for all</l>
      <l>He getts will be at some mans funerall;</l>
      <l>That woud because he had read this book, ee'n dye</l>
      <l>With too immoderate, and strict Chastity.</l>
      <l>Women will burne: wish ev'ry cart goes by</l>
      <l>That they were in't for some Adultery.</l>
      <l>Yet none shall quench their flames, unlesse they will,</l>
      <l>Like <hi>Phaedra,</hi> or be satisfi'd, or kill.</l>
      <l>Or like <hi>Pasiphaë,</hi> run to a Bull entreat</l>
      <l>That for their Husband, that shoud be their meat.</l>
      <l>Perhaps some Brutish Plowman, that can't spell:</l>
      <l>That thinks men conjured Divells out of hell</l>
      <l>With Medicinall Figures, and will not believe,</l>
      <l>May out of Ignorance make his wife Conceive.</l>
      <l>But then th' ofspring shall no more prove him Man</l>
      <l>Then his dull speeches, or his Proverbs can.</l>
      <l>Since by this Act wee'l only judge he knows,</l>
      <l>As much as Oxen doe, how a plough goes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Sure J have humane Nature quite forsooke:</l>
      <l>Nothing can take me now, except this book.</l>
      <l>There does the Physicke faile, and all the Art</l>
      <l>Can but enflame, no whit aswage this dart.</l>
      <l>This Passion's only shifted: still't remaines</l>
      <l>In us a Conquerour, but with lesse staines.</l>
      <l>The Objects only chang'd, from well carv'd stone,</l>
      <l>A Face, to Arts and contemplation.</l>
      <l>Iust like Physitians that an ague turne</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="16"/>
Into a feaver, yet still the Man does burne:</l>
      <l>Still freezes too by fits still hee's not well,</l>
      <l>His bodies only cheated with their spell.</l>
      <l>But they a disease turne to a disease,</l>
      <l>Here though't be passion still, the Ill does cease.</l>
