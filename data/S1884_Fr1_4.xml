   <head>AN EPISTLE TO THE READER, VVAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING HIM OF THE ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode that he ought to keepe in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the French-toung.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first and chiefest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of learning (gentle Reader) is a mutuall loue and agreement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him that doth teach, and him that doth learne: I hope that both are both in you and me. In you, because you seeke for me, and hauing found me, keepe me in your companie, and delight to talke with me. In me, because I haue with very great payne and care, compiled this booke, onely for you, I spare no tyme to doe you good, and preferre your furtheraunce before myne owne studies. But before we goe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is my duety to teach you faithfully, the methode that you ought to keepe, if you will shortly reape the fruite of your hope, and gather the sweet premisses of</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>my liberall promise: you being then so desirous to be taught of me, as I am willing to instruct you, I doe not doubt, but you will be so carefull to obserue both my methode and my rules, so warie to performe the same, and so constant to continue in them, as I haue bene painefull and earnest to inuent them, diligent to pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, and am willing to further you by them. They be fewe, and so the more easie to learne, and lesse hard to practise: and thus much for our mutuall loue. And as for the other, you meane to learne quickly, and I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to teach you speedely, and so we agree. But as I haue taken great paynes in gathering these rules, so you must spare no labour in learning them, and so we shall agree to. For do not thinke that my booke is able by himself to make you a good Frēchmā, except for your part you will play the diligent studient, as for it, it will teach you faithfully. There is nothing though neuer so easie if one goe vnwillingly about it, and besides be not well taught, but he shall finde it most hard. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing though neuer so hard, if one go with a desire to it, an earnest labour about it, vse diligēce in it, and be well taught, but is quickly learned, and founde most easie. Therefore if you will willingly obserue my rules, and carefully keepe my methode, I doe not doubt, but you shall finde the Frēch toung so easie, as other before haue tried it hard: and shall receiue such benefit thereby, that you wil neuer repēt to haue learned of me, nor I to haue taught you. For I hope that shortly you shall receiue the fruite of your hope, the profite of your labour, and</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>I thankes for the reward of my payne.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The first thing I desire you to obserue is, that you will vouchsafe to learne perfectly, and aboue all things both your letters and your syllables. Be not loth to spend three or foure dayes about them, for those foure dayes will do you more profit, then foure monethes spent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the learning of them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly, whē you haue them perfectly, begin to read, but before, spell foure or fiue times euery word, though neuer so small, one after another: And for the beginning take but three or foure lines at once, or more or lesse according as your capacitie can reach, and your paciēce permit. And in your spelling &amp; reading, let not passe any letter nor syllable, without bringing thē to the tryall of your rules, to know if either they must be sounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the English fashion or no, what differēce there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thē, what letter must be pronoūced &amp; what not: and why it is pronoūced or not. I haue spokē of thē par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, so that if you haue neede of any of thē, you shal finde them in their order, and the generall rules after.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thirdly, whē you can read truely, and pronoūce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, thē go about to English it, you haue in this booke the English translation word for word, to teach it you. When you vnderstand it, and are able to English it, thē copie out the French, and write it in some paper booke, the which you shall haue prouided for that purpose. Then after hauing shut your Frēch Alphabeth, write vnder the French, the English that you can giue to it: that being done, conferre your translation with your</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>booke, and amende your faultes if you haue committed any. After that lay away from you the French, and trye if you can put your English translation into Frēch againe. Continue this order for a moneth euery day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating three or foure tymes, both your letters and your syllables, &amp; reading and Englishing as many times your old, from the beginning, till your later lesson: least in learning the one, you should forget the other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, the old may be a helpe to the new. Being once able to read and pronounce perfectly with your rules two or three leaues of your booke at the most, I can assure you, that there is not any Frenche booke, though neuer so hard, but you shall be able to read and pronounce it as truely as can be wished for. For in lesse then in a leafe of your booke, all your rules are to be obserued, three or foure tymes at least. For there is no word but in it is one or two rules to be noted. This way will seeme to you at the beginning very hard, and so though it be more painefull then hard, it is in deede the hardest of the French toung, except it be faithfully taught, and also diligently learned. But though in it selfe it is without teaching, not onely the hardest, but also, as if it were impossible to attaine, you shall finde it the most easiest, if you will learne, and be ruled by these rules.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Fourthly, when you know all the rules of your true pronounciation, and can exactly obserue them in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then go forward speedely in your booke, and euery day translate of it out of French into English, and out</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>of English into French, as much as you can, repeating often your old, least you should forget it. This is the only readiest way to instruct you, not only in the right reading, and naturall pronounciation of the French toung, and in the perfect knowledge and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the same, but also to make you write it truely, and speake it accordingly. Without chaunging of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, keepe this order still, not letting passe any day without learning some thing, and you shall finde, in lesse then fiue or sixe weekes, your labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, afforde you such profite and aduauncement, that you will wonder at it, and much greater then I dare promise you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Furthermore when you are pretely furthered in it, get you acquainted, if it be possible, with some French man, to the end you may practise with him, by dayly conference together, in speech and talke, what you haue learned. And if you be in a place, where the Frenchmen haue a Church for themselues, as they haue in London, get you a French Bible, or a new Testament, and euery day goe both to their Lecture and Sermons. The one will confirme and strength your pronounciation, and the other to vnderstand when one doth speake.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Finally, if you haue a desire both to vnderstand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the hardest and most eloquent French, and to speake it naturally, you must prouide you some French Dictionarie, and the hardest booke you can finde, then translate it, after the maner that I haue prescribed</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>you before, or if you will not take the payne to translate (though it be the surest and shortest way) read it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and picke out in some booke, both the hardest wordes, and the best phrases to serue your turne, either to speake or to write, when you haue neede of.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But because without Grammar it is almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to speake perfectly, but with a very great labour, and long tract of tyme, if this my</hi> French-Alphabeth, <hi>whom I send you for an herbenger of my great loue, and good will I beare you, can finde any fauour at your handes; I will shortly sent you a</hi> FRENCH TVTOR, <hi>that will teach you in so short and easie way, as may be both, by the perfect knowledge of the partes of your speeches and Syntaxe, not onely to speake perfectly, but also to know if one doth not speake well, to reproue him when he doth speake ill, and to teach him how to amend his bad speeche, a thing which yet before hath neuer bene taught. The promise is great, but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance shall not be lesse, if this be acceptable vnto you. If I satisfie you, I doe satisfie my selfe, desiring the one, because I wishe for the other. But if my wishes doe not aunswere to your expectation, I pray you let your fauorable curtesie washe my fault in the streames of the good will I beare you: And in that deuotion. I bid you farewell.</hi>
