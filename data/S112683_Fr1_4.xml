      <salute>CURTEOUS READER:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>(I Name thee as I would find thee) having had thoughts which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten press'd mee to the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this neglected subject, (not as sinfull, but neglected in the discovery) I could not chuse but give entertainment (at last) to so reasonable a motion: yet not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make a work of it, but only to give a few hints for warning, and Characters to know those devouring locusts, who strive to spoile all the green plants of the land.</p>
   <p>But as I pursued some of them in the chace, I started more of the brood; and the further I went, the more I found, till at last, I saw neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb facs="7"/>
of adding resolution and courage to my purpose; and to search them out for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which some have done for pleasure. I found many fearfull exploits amongst them, which being but abridged, made these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers swell into such a thicknesse. Those that are resolved to follow their lusts, regarding nothing, or spoke or writ, let them not passe the front of this Book, lest they be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before their time: and suck poyson till they burst. I know some like snarling Curres will bite the Chaine, though they breake their teeth; and baule at what they understand not; quarrell with their owne shadowes, or bark at the man in the Moon. The painted doxies, and the musk-powd'red Curtizans will be as angry with me, as <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> was with the Mice, for haunting her lamp, and gnawing her caule: and others will cast out smoke and lightning, as <hi>Saturnus</hi> did among the Armies of the Frogs and Mice: but I would wish them (as a friend) to say little, what e're they think, lest they bespeake a smarter whip for themselves. Those that can digest the sowre, need not feare sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting with the sweet. Let every reader take what belongs to himselfe, and passe a gentle

Censure on the rest. The sharpnesse of it is qualified, where advice takes place, and there are none that read but may gaine, or delight, or profit, more or lesse, if they stand not in their own light. I have used their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in some places to set out their folly. Though every Phrase or Sentence be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of real truth, yet there is a probability or morality of truth in all. I need not shew how a Metaphoricall, Analogicall, or an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall speech retaines truth; or how the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures lead to the substance; or of the liberty of speech that Poetry affords: In this I had rather learne than teach. I have not us'd knotty words, nor rocky expressions in the prosecution of it; but in as sutable termes, as my slender wit, with so little art, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Perhaps, the best may find more than they expect; and the worst more than they desire. My <hi>Muse</hi> hath kept her selfe from infection, notwithstanding the many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, occasions, provocations that she hath met withall in her search. I suppose. Envy it selfe will not question the lawfulnesse of the sub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ect; seeing the Prophets in divers places describe Harlots in their kind; and <hi>Salomon</hi> that wise King, in their lookes,

gestures, speeches, fawning, alluring, &amp;c. before he had any practicall experience of them. But if any aske why must I undertake such a work? I answer; why should not any man use the gifts that he hath received to profit himselfe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? especially if delight put him upon it? or if his occasions impose not a necessiy of other imployments upon him? I was never so bound to any but I could purchase some time to raise my <hi>Genius</hi> above these earthly contents below. For the verses, I have kept to one number and measure, only the <hi>Epitaphs</hi> are woven stanza's: In a continued subject, it is not proper to vary the verse.</p>
   <p>I have laboured to make the lines so smooth as I could, in placing the breathing accents where they may fall with most advantage, (except those which run cleane without them) nor have I broke the first, or last foot of the verse, which might make it run harsh, nor straind the coupling accents above what is required in the harmony: nor fallen too low in the descent, which might give the verse an unnaturall sound, where the concords should cheifly meet.</p>
   <p>If you find any verse a syllable too short in the number, then compare the measure with it;
<pb facs="8"/>
for if there be a monosyllable that sounds long uppon the letter[r] it will answer to a Spondey, or a Trochey, consisting of two syllables; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the breathing or the coupling accents. If any seem too long, observe but the cadence, which may fall a syllable longer in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, yet answer with a true sound: or cls it may fall low, that a Dactyle which consists of three syllables, beares but the sound of two: and many words consisting of two, three, foure, or five syllables, do naturally fall a syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable shorter in the pronunciation; or being cut short by Apostrophes, 'twill resolve the doubt. I commit my <hi>Muse</hi> to your care; her colour's black and white, you may trust her: she has been purg'd in the <hi>Search,</hi> and prest for revealing secrets; she'll both give and take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by it, and wisheth the Reader to do the like.</p>
