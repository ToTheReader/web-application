The Saint is but home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrayed, and not for these curious daies wherein wee liue: and in which the Son, though clad with glory: yet cannot runne it course, but with censure either of too high a pitch, and then it burneth, or of too lowe a being, and so it heateth not. Atheists, Papists, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes, will censure my plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both in matter of faith and fact, I looke for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to feele their pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing eye, and venomous tooth: yet if I escape in some measure the sorrow of my

blessednesse there, we may not leap out of our mothers wombe into our fathers ioy: but wee must goe by staires from the Temple of grace, to the Tower of glory.</p>
   <p>In the meane time this is yours, and so am I in all duty and deuotion obliged, by many your respectiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to me, and mine, from you and yours. Nor doe I hope you will conceiue the length, breadth, and depth of the loue I beare you, can euer bee contained within the circle of these fewe lines. Epistles, and papers may point at more loue then they can expresse: but the

heart is the closet that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all, how euer these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers speake.
