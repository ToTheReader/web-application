   <head>To the Right Worshipfull, Sir
<hi>Nicholas Bacon Knight: long life in</hi>
prosperitie, with endles ioye by
Mortalitie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Aakob</hi> could not beare the
vnkindenes of <hi>Laban,</hi> but
departed from him: <hi>Dauid</hi>
could not suffer the discurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Hanun,</hi> but attempted
warre. The Heathen Man
made a Lawe to punish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
persons with death:
And <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Hee that rewardeth euill for
good, euill shall neuer depart from his house.</hi> These
examples and sayings (right Worshipfull) although
they be manifest in many to practise, they be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in this place to repeate; for I feare no ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for my goodwill, though I merit displeasure
for my presumption. But where the Vnicorne drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all infection is driuen away, where the Beare
breatheth no other beastes will feede, where lenitie
harboreth no misliking can happen. It was boldlie
done of <hi>Sinaetaes</hi> to offer <hi>Cyrus</hi> a handfull of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or of the Persian to giue <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the like;
they being beggers by abilitie, those being Kinges
by calling, and the presents farre vnfit for Princes.
Yet their willingnes in accepting, did bewray the
worthines of their calling: for as the tree is known
<pb facs="3"/>
by the frute, the golde by the touch, the bell by the
sound: euen so is a mans birth by his beneuolence, his
honour by his humilitie, his calling by his curtesie, and
indeede true Gentillitie should obserue one thing by
the Lark, which although he mounts neuer so high in
the ayre, yet hee buildeth his nest very lowe on the
earth. I presume with these poore men to offer a
booke no better worth than their water, and I hope
by the curtesie of these kings your worship will accept
of it as it is, measuring the matter by the mulberie,
which will euer bee red though it bee not ripe, but if
the tree be full of blossomes and beare not, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
impute the fault to the rygorous weather, and
not to the roote, and if my booke carry a great shew
without substāce, I trust your VVorship wil attribute
the defect to my ignorance and not to my beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
for hee that diggeth in the coale-pit woulde
worke in minerall if he might, and he that bloweth
the fire would fashion the iuell if he could, the twigg
must haue much time to grow ere it be great, and I
more libertie to practise, ere I be perfect: All men
write not according to their learning, but their
leasure, <hi>Apelles</hi> drew the picture of <hi>Venus</hi> in the
beginning very rude, by continuance very rare, so
he that at the first by his attempts appeares simple, at
length may proue singular, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did mend
his stammering with much striuing against the hil,
and so shall I my learning with more labour in study,
yet he that carrieth morter though he be no mason,
is not to be blamed because he furthereth the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
neither is he that shewes his diligence, though
he cannot doe well, to be reprehended, because of his
<pb facs="3"/>
good dispositiō: we mislike not the Taylor, so he can
mend where he maketh a fault in the garment, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought any to discourage that Author, so he may
correct, where he comitteth an escape in his writing,
considering what difference there is betweene cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the hand, and conceiuing with the head:
But I hope your VVorship (in whome the pure word
of GOD is planted) will carrie <hi>Moecenas</hi> minde, to
further and fauour aswell the forward as the famous
writers, and then shall my Treatise, though it bee
simple haue good successe: it sufficeth me although it
be but barbarous, that it hath beene allowed by my
betters, or whatsoeuer it be, so it be well accepted of
your VVorship, I craue no other rewarde, than your
patronage of this enterprise though it be simple, and
your pardon for my good will if I offend. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loth to trouble your worship with many
words, referring the ouersight hereof to
your graue censure, humbly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my selfe to your curtesie, I
commit the tuition of your
W. to the Almighty.</p>
