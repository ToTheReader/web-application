   <head>To the right Honourable, the Lord Thomas Haward.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT beeing greatly forward of mine owne inclination (right Honourable) but forced by the importunitie of my friends to make some triall of my selfe in this exercise of translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I haue aduentured vpon a peece of work, not indeed the most profitablest, as intreating of armes, nor yet altogether fruitlesse, if example may serue, as being historicall, but the while, either to be borne withall for the delight, or not to be refused for the strangenesse: far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I meane not to make boast of my trauaile, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was offred, not made choice of, as there appeared likewise little libertie in my first yeelding. The earnestnesse of my friends perswaded me that it was conuenient to laie foorth my talent for increase, or to set my candle on a candlesticke, &amp; the consideration of my sufficiencie droue me to thinke it better for my ease, either quite to burie my talent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to auoide the breaking of thriftlesse debtes, or rather to put my candle cleane out, then that it should bewraie euery vnswept corner in my house, but the opinion of my friends iudgement preuailed aboue mine own reason. So vpon hope to please them, I first vndertooke this labour, &amp; I haue gone through withall, the rather to acquaint my selfe with mine olde reading: whereto since the dispatch therof, I haue made, my friends priuie, &amp; vpon good liking, with request thereto I haue passed my graunt vnto them for the publication, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring for my selfe the order for the dedication, so as I shuld thinke best, either for the defence of my worke or for some perticular merit towards mee. And heerein I tooke no long leasure to finde out a sufficient personage. For the manifold benefites receiued from your honourable parents, my good
<pb facs="3"/>Lord and Ladie, quickly eased me of that doubt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented your honour vnto my view: whome by good right I ought to loue and honour in especiall, as being of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, at whose hands I haue reaped especiall benefit. The which benefit if I should not so gladly professe openly, as I willingly receiued being offered, I might well be challenged of vnkindnesse, but were I as able to make good my part, as I am not ignorant what may bee required at my handes, I would hope not to be found vngratefull. In the meane time this my trauaile I commend vnto your Lordship, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same so to accept thereof, as a simple testimonie of that good will which I bare to your parents while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then being their seruant, &amp; now doe owe vnto their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring after their decease for their demerits. Vnder your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors protection I shall lesse feare the assault of the enuious, &amp; of your honours good acceptation, I haue some hope in the mildnesse of your Lordshippes nature, not doubting but that as your Lordship hath giuen no small signification in this your noble youth of wisdome and courage to so many as know you, it being the onely support of your auncestors line: so the same likewise will maintaine your auncestours glorie, and the hope of your owne vertues with affabilitie &amp; gentlenesse, which was the proper commendation of your parents. The almightie increase this hope with the other vertues before named, to the good hope of your Countries peace, your Princesse safetie, and your owne honour, with the ioy of your kindred &amp; friends, whom not a few your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents good deseruing hath assured vnto you, and of whose earnest praiers you shall not faile, to further your well doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Amongst them, though last in worthinesse, yet with the formost in well wishing and desire of well deseruing, your honour shall finde me.</p>
