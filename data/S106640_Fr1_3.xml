         <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Isdaine not mighty Prince those humble lines,</l>
      <l>Though too meane Musicke for so dainty eares,</l>
      <l>Since with thy greatnesse, learnings glory shines,</l>
      <l>So that thy brow a two-fold Lawrell beares</l>
      <l>To thee the Muses, Phoebus now resignes,</l>
      <l>And Vertues hight eternall trophees reares;</l>
      <l>As <hi>Orpheus</hi> Harpe, heavens may enstall thy pen</l>
      <l>A liberall light to guide the mindes of Men.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Although my wit be weake, my Vowes are strong,</l>
      <l>Which consecrate devoutly to thy name</l>
      <l>My Muses labours, which ere it be long,</l>
      <l>May graft some feathers in the wings of fame,</l>
      <l>And with the subject to conforme my song,</l>
      <l>May in more lofty lines thy worth proclame,</l>
      <l>With gorgeous colours courting glories light,</l>
      <l>Till circling Seas doe bound her ventrous flight.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Ere thou wast borne, and since, heaven thee endeeres,</l>
      <l>Held backe, as best to grace these last worst Times;</l>
      <l>The World long'd for thy birth three hundreth yeeres,</l>
      <l>Since first fore-told wrapt in Propheticke rimes,</l>
      <l>His love to thee, the Lords deliveries cleeres,</l>
      <l>From Sea, from Sword, from Fire, from Chance, from Crimes,</l>
      <l>And that to him thou onely might be bound,</l>
      <l>Thy selfe was still the meanes foes to confound.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I doe not doubt but Albions warlike coast,</l>
      <l>(still kept unconquer'd by the heavens decree)</l>
      <l>The Picts expell'd, the Danes repell'd, did boast</l>
      <l>(In spite of all <hi>Romes</hi> power) a state still free,</l>
      <l>As that which was ordain'd (though long time crost</l>
      <l>In this Herculean birth) to bring forth thee,</l>
      <l>Whom many a famous Sceptred Parent brings</l>
      <l>From an undaunted race to doe great things.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <lg>
      <l>Of this divided Ile the Nurslings brave,</l>
      <l>Earst, from intestine warres could not desist,</l>
      <l>Yet did in forraine fields their names engrave,</l>
      <l>Whilst whom one spoil'd the other would assist:</l>
      <l>Those now made one, whilst such a head they have,</l>
      <l>What world of words were able to resist?</l>
      <l>Thus hath thy worth (great IAMES) conjoyn'd them now,</l>
      <l>Whom battels oft did breake, but never bow.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And so, most justly thy renowned deeds</l>
      <l>Doe raise thy fame above the starry round,</l>
      <l>Which in world a glad amazement breeds,</l>
      <l>To see the vertues (as they merit) crown'd,</l>
      <l>Whilst thou (great Monarch who in power exceeds,</l>
      <l>With vertuous goodnesse do st vast greatnesse bound,</l>
      <l>Where, if thou lik'dst to be more great, then good,</l>
      <l>Thou might'st soone build a Monarchie with bloud.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O! this faire world without the world, no doubt,</l>
      <l>Which <hi>Neptune</hi> strongly guards with liquid bands,</l>
      <l>As aptest so to rule the Realmes about,</l>
      <l>She by her selfe (as most Majesticke) stands,</l>
      <l>Thence (the worlds Mistris) to give judgement out,</l>
      <l>With full authority for other Lands,</l>
      <l>Which on the Seas would gaze attending still,</l>
      <l>By wind-wing'd Messengers their Soveraignes will.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Southerne Regions did all Realmes surpasse,</l>
      <l>And were the first which sent great Armies forth;</l>
      <l>Yet Soveraignty that there first founded was,</l>
      <l>Still by degrees hath drawne unto the North,</l>
      <l>To this great Climate which it could not passe,</l>
      <l>The fat all period bounding all true worth:</l>
      <l>For, it cannot from hence a passage finde,</l>
      <l>By roring Rampiers still with us confinde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>As Waters which a masse of earth restraines,</l>
      <l>(If they be, swelling high begin to vent)</l>
      <l>Doe rage disdainefully over all the plaines,</l>
      <l>As with strict borders scorning to be pent:</l>
      <l>Even so this masse of earth, that thus remaynes,</l>
      <l>Wall'd in with waves, if (to burst out when be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>t.)</l>
      <l>(The bounding flouds o're-flow'd) it rush forth, then</l>
      <l>That deluge would o're-run the world with men.</l>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <l>Then since great Prince) the torrent of thy power,</l>
      <l>May drowne whole Nations in a Scarlet floud,</l>
      <l>On Infidels thy indignation powre,</l>
      <l>And bathe not Christian bounds with Christian bloud:</l>
      <l>The Tyrant <hi>Ottoman</hi> (who would devoure</l>
      <l>All the redeemed souls) may be withstood,</l>
      <l>While as thy troups (great Albions Emperour) once</l>
      <l>Do comfort Christs afflicted flock which moanes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thy thundring troups might take the stately rounds</l>
      <l>Of <hi>Constantines</hi> great Towne renown'd in vaine,</l>
      <l>And barre the barbarous Turks the baptiz'd bounds,</l>
      <l>Reconquering <hi>Godfreys</hi> conquests once againe;</l>
      <l>O, well spent labours! O illustrious wounds!</l>
      <l>Whose trophees should eternall glory gaine,</l>
      <l>And make the Lyon to be fear'd farre more,</l>
      <l>Then ever was the Eagle of before.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But, O thrice happy thou that of thy Throne</l>
      <l>The boundlesse power for such an use controuls!</l>
      <l>Which if some might command to raigne alone,</l>
      <l>Of all their life they would be-bloud the scrouls,</l>
      <l>And to content the haughtie thoughts of one</l>
      <l>Would sacrifize a thousand thousand souls,</l>
      <l>Which thou do'st spare, though having sprite and might,</l>
      <l>To challenge all the world as thine owne right.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then unto whom more justly could I give</l>
      <l>Those famous ruines of extended states</l>
      <l>(Which did the world of libertie deprive</l>
      <l>By force, or fraud, to reare Tyrannick seats)</l>
      <l>Then unto thee, who may and will not live</l>
      <l>Like those proud Monarchs borne to stormy fates?</l>
      <l>But whil'st frank-sprited Prince, thou this wouldst flee,</l>
      <l>Crowns come unsought, and Scepters seek to thee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Vnto the Ocean of thy worth I send</l>
      <l>Those runnels, rising from a rash attempt;</l>
      <l>Not that I to augment that depth pretend,</l>
      <l>Which heavens from all necessitie exempt,</l>
      <l>The Gods small gifts of zealous mindes commend,</l>
      <l>While Hecatombes are holden in contempt:</l>
      <l>So (Sir) I offer at your vertues shrine</l>
      <l>This little incense, or this smoke of mine.</l>
