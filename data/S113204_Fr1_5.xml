Of London, if any desire to know the aptenesse of scituation, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of soyle, holesomnes of aire, Antiquitie, deriuation of name, honour of Armes, dignitie and vertue of Magistrates, martiall Exercises, natures of vsuall armes both auncient and moderne, in this little worke, as through a glasse they may behold all these reflected frō the light of auncient &amp; authentike authors The order and maner into which I haue digested this little labor is thus, I haue grounded an Inductiō to the ensuing Cantoes, on certain reliques of Roman Antiquity, found in the feild, adioyning to this hopefull Companies Campus Martius, vulgarly called the Artillerie garden, amongst which the Image of <hi>Minerua</hi> being one, I haue made her, beeing President of arts and armes, the Author of my Poem, deuided into ten <hi>Cantoes,</hi> to which <hi>I</hi> haue adioyned certain notes of Illustration in Prose, not out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected singularity, it being a thing not vsuall, but both to explain such places, which to the ignorant and perhaps to some, who think themselues no common Readers, may seeme difficult, and also to confirme such points of historie, by the testimonie of approoued Authors, which in my Poem may seeme doubtfull: For thy better instruction (gentle Reader) I intreate thee to obserue, that this marke "against any verse stands as a note of direction to the same verse in the Illustrations. Thus hoping a charitable censure, I craue no other reward for my paines, but that thou feeding on the fruite of my labor maist well disgest it.</p>
