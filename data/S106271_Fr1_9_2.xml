      <p>Cousin, I pray peruse the enclosed, which troubleth me as much as it
doth my sonne, and seeke satisfaction of such as are skilfull indeed.
I care not for charge, for looke whatsoeuer it costs I will beare it. In the
meane while comfort my childe, for if it bee so as hee writes, hee shall not
stay in <hi>London,</hi> though it cost me fiue hundred Pounds. And so in
great hast I leaue you to our Lord Christ, &amp;c.</p>

      <head>The Apprentises Letter to his Father.</head>
      <p>MOst deare, and most louing Father, my most humble dutie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
vnto you. These are to giue you to vnderstand, that
my body is in good health, praised he God, but my minde, and spirits are
not, for they are very much troubled. For, so it is Sir, that albeit my
Master be a very worthy, and an honest Citizen, and that my selfe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as an Apprentise ought (which I doe willingly, not refusing any thing,
as remembring St. <hi>Peters</hi> precept, <hi>Serui, subditi estote in timore Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini)</hi>
am as well vsed in this house, as if I were with you; yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
certaine bookes, at spare houres, and conferring with some who take
vpon them to be very well skill'd in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> I am brought to beleeue,
that by being a Prentise, I lose my birth right, and the right of my blood
both by father, and mother, which is to be a Gentlemen, which I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dye, then to endure. This is my griefe, and this the cause why my
minde is so troubled, as I cannot eat, nor sleepe in quiet: Teares hinder
me from writing more, and therefore most humbly crauing pardon, and
your most fatherly blessing, I commit you to God, &amp;c.</p>
