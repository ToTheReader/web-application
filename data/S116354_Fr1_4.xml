   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat be the priuiledges and high fauours of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, wherwith he hath preferred this age, and in speciall our nation aboue all before vs, since the daies of the holie Apostles, needeth more meditation to moue our selues to thankfulnes, thē proof to cōuince our aduersaries, who though they should gainsay it, shall gnash their teeth and pine away in griefe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. Among all (I may say with the Prophet and the Apostle) this is chiefe, that God hath so cleerely <hi>shewed his word to Iacob, his statutes and his iudgements to Israel; and hath committed to vs his holy oracles:</hi> Wherein I meane not only that we haue the Gospell so publikly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully preached, which (though great) is common to vs with many: but withall, that in some admirable manner, God hath reuealed his secrets vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, such as wee know no Church vpon the earth, in which the true sense of the Scriptures and sound doctrine thereof, are more sincerely embraced and professed. Yea with what store of rare and excellent lights the Lord hath furnished this our Church, he is blind that seeth not, and malitious that wil not acknowledge it: wherein though generally it falleth out by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie and Sathans subtiltie, that there is more light of iudgement, then integritie of conscience; yet herein God hath not left himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witnes of many worthie Christians both Preachers and professors of the truth, who liuely expresse the forme of holie doctrine into which they are cast, such as vpon my vttermost perill I dare professe, the deuoutest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist neither hath nor possiblie (in that profession) can attaine vnto, lacking true faith the right mother and nurse of a godly life. And herein to giue one instance in steed of many, take and examine streightly this one work, and if it breathe not out more sound godlines in one leafe, then all their artificiall composed treatises of Resolution (which in their estimation are chiefe in this argument of a godly life) let me beare my deserued blame. I leaue the life of the writer of that Popish booke to such as seeme vpon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge to haue set out the same. And for the Author of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I may not in modestie say what I know, but could and doe desire that his life were so knowne to all, to whom his writing shall come, as it is to such, who haue heard the doctrine and seene the practise hereof in himself these well neere thirtie yeeres. But to spare the person for his life time, and to foretell what you shall finde in his labours. In my simple opinion it might in one principal respect be called the Anatomie of the soule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onely the great and principall parts are laid open, but euery veine and little nerue are so discouered, that wee may as it were, with the eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as the right constitution of the whole and euery part of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
<pb facs="4"/>
so the manifold defects and imperfections thereof. Whereto be added most approoued remedies for the curing of all spirituall diseases, with like preseruatiues to maintaine our health, in such sort as may be enioyed in this contagious ayre, and so in a second respect may be called the physicke of the soule. In both which how welcome it shall be to all that loue their soules health, I neede not doubt: onely I would desire the Christian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, not to be offended with the largenes of the work (as too deare for the poore, and too much to be read ouer in long time) but consider with me, that if the arte of bodily physicke be so long, as the father of that arte testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; then is it no marueile, that this spirituall physicke doth as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other in length, as it doth in dignitie. And yet for the reliefe of such as desire to profit by his labour, great care hath been taken so to set out apart euery seuerall matter, that by the helpe of the Table they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the particulars, which I perswade my selfe will be so farre from glutting any, though neuer so weake stomacke, that it will rather procure him a better appetite. For simply to say, as I feele, I haue not read in any mans writing a more sauourie stile and better relished. All which I leaue to euery one to speake as they finde, and so with my strongest desires doe commend the fruite of these labours to the blessing of God.</p>
