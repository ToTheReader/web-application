   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>REader whosoever. If many and great judgements have descended from their high imploiments, to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at leasurable hours, with light exercises and mirthfull recreations as S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Thomas <hi>Moore</hi> did, when he pend his <hi>Vtopia, Erasmus</hi> his praise of <hi>Follie, Fannius</hi> his Nettle. I trust thou wilt hold mee excused who at this time having no imployment at all, have made this relation of the late Progresse of <hi>Meum,</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> two Foot-posts, that dis-ease the whole Kingdome, set at strife Lords and their Tenants, Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their Parishes, Citizens and Country Chapmen, Inkeepers and their Guests, Carmen and Coachmen about the way, Pedlers for their standings at Faires, Gamsters in the Bowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Alleyes,
<pb facs="3"/>
Water-bearers at the Conduite, in a word, men of all estates and condition, one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am informed they meane shortly to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit all the Shires in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and in those Shires every Market Towne, to follow all Assises, to get acquaintance among Proctors in all Spirituall Courts, and where they cannot be themselves, to send their Deputies; So that at their next returne to the City, I shall know their full intent; which (with what hath passed since their last being in the Country) I will from their own information hereafter (as neare as I can) relate. <hi>Vale.</hi>
