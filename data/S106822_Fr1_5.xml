      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I am not ignoraūt, how daūgerous</hi> an enterprise it is, in this age eyther to write or diuulgate any worke abrode (most gentle reader) yet I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lingly commit that inconstant leuitie, or light inconstancy should be obiected agaynste me, for not impartyng vnto thee these my simple Prelections, and speciallye for not the accomplishyng of my promise, whiche I openly made to an open auditorie, partely also to staye the great importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of certayne of my friendes, who hath at diuerse and sondry tymes expostulate with me, for deferyng of the same so longe a tyme. Beholde nowe they come fourth, althoughe late, yet (I truste) not to late. And althoughe they be more grosse and rude, then meete to satisfie and aunswere the fine heades of this tyme, yet coumpt them, I pray thee, not all vaine and vnprofitable. And know thou that it is a godly thing, not onely to set fourth such worthy workes, as tende to gods glory &amp; the vtility of the publique weale, namely to the instructiō of the simple and ignoraunt, but also to haue onely a good will to do the same.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8,</note> For where habilitie lacketh, good will is onely to be receaued, &amp; not reiected, as the holy Apostle saint Paule wtiteth to the Corinthians. <hi>Si voluntas prompta est secundū id quod habet accepta est, non secundum id quod non habet:</hi> If there he a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a mā hath, and not according to that he hath not: And looke not here (gētle reader) for an exquisite methode, looke not here for the flourishyng flowers of Demosthenes, looke not here for the eloquent stile of Cicero, for that veine of writing, to this kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is vtterly impertinent, but thou shalte haue here certaine lessons, although playne, yet not al vaine although not beautified with great learning, yet profitable for thy readyng. If my rashe remeritie or temerous rashnes shall offend any person, let him remēber the greke cōmon prouerbe, which doth promise <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is pardō to him, whiche geueth fourth his first attemptate, and experiment, wherfore if thou wilt vouchafe to read them, when thou art at leasure, and (as they say) <hi>horis successiuis,</hi> I shall thincke my laboure well bestowed, and that I haue not lost <hi>omnino oleum &amp; operam</hi> If these simple Prelections chaunce peraduenture to come into the handes of some scrupulous and captious criticall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (for whose disease there is no medicine) let him know that it is a great deale more easie to carpe other mens doinges, then to giue better of his owne. Agayne on the other side, if there be any of Momus clients which will vmbraide me for inserting and putting in other mennes sayinges and sentences in this my vnframed frame, let him consider these foure thynges fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. First let him weigh I say what was in the like case obiected to saint Hierome, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his learned Commentaries vpon the Prophets, for he in the preface of the second booke vpon the Prophet Micheas, writeth after this maner. Where they say, that I robbe the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes and workes of Origine, and that it becometh not the writings of the auncient fathers to be contaminate and spoyled, that thing whiche they esteme and coumpte to be a vehement and reprochefull checke, I do coumpte it to be no smale prayse, for as much as I followe hym, with whom I doubt not both you and all wise men are much pleased. For if it be so haynous a faulte to translate the good sayinges and sentences of the Grecians, then let Ennius, and Virgill, Plautus, and Cecilius, Terentius, and Tullius and other eloquent and learned men be accused and blamed, who haue not onely translated certayne verses, but also whole Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, long bookes, and whole Comedies, yea thē let our brother Hilarius be gilty and accused of theft, because writing vpon the Psalmes, he hath translated and turned almost forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand verses out of the foresaid Origene, and set them into his owne booke. All whose negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I wish rather to follow,<note place="margin">Eccle. 1.</note> then their obscure and darke diligence. <hi>Haec Hieronimus.</hi> Secōd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly let him remember not onely that whiche Salomon recordeth in his boke called <hi>Ecclesiastes. Quid est quod fuit? ipsum quod futurum est. Quid est quod factum este ipsum quod faciendū est.</hi> What is that hath bene? that which shalbe, &amp; what is that, that hath ben done? that which shalbe done. But let him also I say expende this which Terence writeth, <hi>Nullum est iam dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quod non dictum sit prius,</hi> there is nothing now spoken, that hath not bene spoken before. Thirdly let him marcke the title of the booke named <hi>Pragmatei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> or Miscellanea</hi> Whiche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
<pb n="17" facs="21"/> of diuerse &amp; sondry things, and therfore nedeth the more mens iudgemēts &amp; helpes, Fourthly and finally let him ponder and weigh how I haue eased the reader of a great deale of labour and payne, to the attaynement of the knowledge of such thinges whiche he should otherwise bene faine to haue sought in diuerse and sondry workes, and those huge and great. Here I haue collected and couched the same together in this one litle opuscle &amp; small worke, whiche also may saue him from disbursing of some parte of his money, in deare biyng other great workes. If he expend and consider (I say) these things, I trust he will ceasse from faulte finding, and be more willing to be thankefull. What should I say more? If any wilbe so open eyed, and such faulte finders, that they will despise these my poore mites, which <hi>I</hi> caste with the poore widowe into the treasurie chest of Christes Churche, I would friendly desire suche with the wordes of Horace.</p>
