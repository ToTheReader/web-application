   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout tenne yeares past, when the Church of <hi>Orlians</hi> was in her flowers, and I then hauing this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters thereof, then I set forth certaine Prayers and Meditations vppon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine notable places of the scripture, which I had gathered out and laid aside for mine owne priuate vse: yet notwithstanding, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested of sundrie good and godlie men, I was content, that manie others should inioy the same. And that they might be pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to ardent prayer, and to all holie and Christianlike Meditations, who were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to waxe cold, or at least but leuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, in time of prosperitie: foreseeing likewise, that all the rest, wherewith the Church doeth glad her selfe in this world, was but a truse and small respit: and that
<pb facs="6"/> it behooued them,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Timo.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. The late M. Caluin in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face vpon Daniel. 61. truelie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that they should haue as yet great fightes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. The said Churche was of number a seuen thowsand persons in time past. <hi>Iames</hi> 5.</note> which were determined to serue God purelie, to make their account, that they must suffer great persecutiōs, during which, prayer is the verie stay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the faithfull soule. As alas long since, wee haue well prooued, when that all the billowes and stormes of the Lord, sith these x. yeares haue passed, not alonelie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie through out all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie vppon this poore Church of <hi>Orlians,</hi> which in times past wee haue seene a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of great pleasure, a retraite to manie good men, and of all sortes and conditions: to bee short, it was as the repaire and fould of the Lordes sheep, in the middest of all <hi>Fraūce,</hi> Now wee doe see it turned into dust and ashes, and to become the dwelling place of Dragons and Scorpions: we I say, vnto whome God hath giuen this grace, to escape so manie blouddie Alaroms: yea so manie fearefull deathes, that we haue perceiued of what force earnest prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be, and what satisfying &amp; contentation, the faithfull soule hath with God, when as all other thinges doe seeme to faile him, in such sort as we haue matter to say with the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the <hi>119. Psal.</hi> verse <hi>92.</hi> Had it not bin that thy lawe was my delight, I had euen then perished in my afflictions. Now as the true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of God haue a zeale vnto the ashes, and
<pb facs="6"/> ruines of <hi>Sion,</hi> when it is turned into dust,<note place="margin">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> 9.</note> and forsaken of all the world: So cannot I (so long as the soule panteth within me) cease euer with a burning desire to pray vnto God, or to haue care of this so desolate a Church of <hi>Orlians,</hi> willing truelie to say with the prophet <hi>Esaiah,</hi> in the <hi>62. Chap.</hi> For the loue of <hi>Sion,</hi> I will not keepe silence, and as cōcerning <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> I will not cease vntill her righteousnesse shine out as the light, &amp; that her saluation be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as a Lampe: in such sort as setting before my eies that at no time praiers were euer more necessarie than in these dayes, being on euerie side full of calamitie, neither yet the vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of better vnderstood of the true faithful, than whē as men are in their true schoole, that is to say vnder the Crosse. And being likewise since the decease of this second <hi>Iosias</hi> &amp; so Christiā a prince, as the late my Lord Elector <hi>Palatine Federick</hi> (vnder whom I haue had this honor to preach the word of God, more thā 4. yeares) being as it were into mine owne wildernesse a part drawen to meditate &amp; lamēt the miseries of our time: I tooke againe into my handes these prayers, that heretofore I had set forth &amp; brought to light, &amp; dedicated to the Church of <hi>Orliās,</hi> as wel to put thē together againe, &amp; so to disgest thē, by a better order, as also to seeme not to haue lost the remēbrāce of that Church,
<pb facs="7"/> which of good right amongst other I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes loued and honored, hauing serued there, the space of eight yeares, and receaued verie much credit and friendship of manie good men: or, least I should seeme to haue lost all hope to see it againe reestablished, or at the least somewhat gathered together after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and fearefull stormes. Nowe concerning the order which I haue held in this booke, it shall be spoken hereof in the end of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
   <p>But now, I will lay out the causes which haue made me yet to hope, that this good God will not altogether forsake this poore flocke. And therefore it maketh me yet againe to direct this little booke vnto the residue as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a small corner of the fould: to the end to sorte out, and call back the rest of the flocke vnto a true faith, hope, and calling vppon the name of God. It is a thing certaine, that in these later daies the diuell is come downe in great anger, knowing that he hath but a small time. And in this is fulfilled all that which the Lorde foretold thereof in the 12. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> &amp; as the miseries foretold are fulfilled, in like maner the promised deliuerance shal be accomplished, and alwaies this goodly sentence shall remaine true that is in the <hi>76. Psalme:</hi> That the anger of the vngodly shall returne
<pb facs="7"/> vnto the praise of the Lorde, and that hee will restraine the rest of their furies.</p>
   <p>And that which <hi>S. Peter</hi> speaketh in the 3. Chap. of his first Epistle, Who shall hurt you,<note place="margin">The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours that Orlians hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at other times of the Lorde.</note> if you followe goodnesse? O but some man will say, in times past <hi>Orlians</hi> hath founde such fauour at Gods handes, as in the time of <hi>Atila,</hi> when all the countrey being couered ouer with rude people, the citie was kept by the praiers of good folke, or when it was in times past, (as some say) miraculously kept, rather than by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie helpe of man from the siege of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen:</hi> or if we must come vnto the thinges more certaine and fresh in memorie, when as in the yeare of our Lorde 1560. in the time of king <hi>Frauncis</hi> the seconde of that name, the most furious force that might be in mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēbraunce was in the citie, &amp; the preparation most cruell against so many notable and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men of name, who had as they say the knife set to the throte, many good and honorable ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens wandering vp and downe from one place to an other: when I say, the Lorde in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turned the sorrowe of his Church into gladnesse, and their captiuitie into freedome.</p>
   <p>And againe in the yeare 1563.<note place="margin">Orlians beseeged.</note> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the spring time the citie enuironed with a victorious armie consisting of <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Swyssardes,</hi> and <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> it was at
<pb facs="8"/> vnawares, and by a happe vnlooked for, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered of the siege,<note place="margin">The peace of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins with Orlians.</note> but honoured with a peace, which was made with the <hi>Orlians,</hi> and indured for a certaine time, leauing the citie for some yeares in a tollerable estate. Since the saide peace, certaine massacres, treasons, and conspiracies, which then were had there, both on the right hande, and on the left, as in the countrey of <hi>Mans,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Orlians stripped againe.</note> at <hi>Tours,</hi> at <hi>Blois,</hi> and in manie other places of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> it being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether stripped, as it was in the yeare <hi>64.</hi> and for the most part a bootie vnto tyrantes, &amp; being in time of neede the place for those of the Church to come vnto, it was then maintained in good rest, and in the exercise of the pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">The secōd troubles.</note> whatsoeuer contrarie gouernours were there being in garison, vntill the yeare <hi>1567.</hi> in which time, toward Michaelmas, the seconde troubles began againe, and a strange coniuration being made, as well in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as in the lowe countries against the faithful, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the enimies were in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and well armed within the citie, awayting but the watch worde, to cut the throtes of all the faithfull. The foresaid citie, together with the citidell, was by a speciall fauour of God kept and defended with a handfull of men, the most part of the Church not knowing any thing
<pb facs="8"/> thereof, euen against so manie aduersaries and subtil deuises, and to the ende it might serue for the seconde time,<note place="margin">The peace at Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres.</note> for a place of rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which out of all partes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> placed themselues there, by reason of the crueltie which was then through all exercised against the Christians.</p>
   <p>And in this behalfe ought a man to keepe secret the fauour, which the Church of <hi>Orli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> prooued by the God of hostes? When as this miserable peace made at <hi>Chartres,</hi> being made in the yeare of our Lorde <hi>1568.</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>March,</hi> the citie was deliuered into the handes of the aduersaries, foming with rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a citie, which at two sundrie times had made resistance and was the refuge of Princes, Lordes, and other, bearing as then armes for the common wealth: when I say with a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour enimie of the reformed religion, there were brought into the saide citie,<note place="margin">The regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of countie Brissakes.</note> ten ensignes of the brauest and skilfull souldiers, that could be chosen, to swallowe vp as it were in a moment the saide Church: but God in the meane season did shewe this fauour to my fellowes and mee, euen there to preach in a goodlie assemblie euen in the sight of the souldiers, for the space of fiue monethes,
<pb facs="9"/> amongest a thowsand and a thowsand dangers, mutenies, and harquebusers, and infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses: the citie being in this time kept, that no citizen man or woman of the religion, could passe out of the gates, without a thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand dangers: when our houses were dailie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen, the gates of our assemblies enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned by troupes of the enemies souldiers: And that for presidents, (as a man would say) wee had in our consistories Captaines, renouncers of God, &amp; other such people as it pleased those go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners to send thither: Then in trueth wee felt such an assistance of the almightie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that men walke in the shadow of death, &amp; when they burned in good houre the Temple, with the streete of <hi>Illiers,</hi> and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie may well remember there, the souldiers of the garrison, seeing the patience and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Church, as it were touched at the heart, &amp; tamed, in part being without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison more fauorable, and gratious vnto those of the Church, than were the citizen papists, who hauing beene at the foresaid warres for the most part assisted and hid, as it were in our bosome in their daungers, and all as it were rendering a verie ill reward to their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the religion.</p>
   <p>During this time, some one will say the Church of <hi>Orlians</hi> hath felt, yea the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors
<pb facs="9"/> of God:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 120.</note> in such sort as oftentimes it hath beene said of them: God worketh woonders vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and sundrie and manie times haue they song &amp; song againe in a godlie assemblie, whereof I cannot remember my selfe without teares, the <hi>Psal. 124.</hi>
      <note place="margin">The Psalme of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church of Orli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> For Israel may now well say &amp;c. Which <hi>Psal.</hi> the Church of <hi>Orlians</hi> esteemed as her particular <hi>Psalme,</hi> for the aforesaid deliuerances. But alas will some aunswere, since the xv. of <hi>September,</hi> in they yeare <hi>1568.</hi> euen vntill now, what other thing hath a man seene, but calamitie vppon calamitie distilled vpon the said Church, and so sharpe and violent affliction, as it is hard to thinke thereof without a mans haire standing &amp; staring for feare &amp; horror on his head? For from that day which was vppon a Sunday:<note place="margin">The first Massacar at Orlians in the yeare 1568.</note> I hauing preached at vi. a clocke in the <hi>Estape,</hi> which place then onelie rested to vs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing greatlie to the purpose (alas in this last preaching,) expounded the text of the xvi. of <hi>S. Marke</hi> vpon the historie of the passion:<note place="margin">The last preaching made within Orlians.</note> My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? For euen iust thithertow as I come in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>S. Marke:</hi> Maister <hi>De Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> then also Minister of the said Church, hauing made his Sermon at eight of the clock in the same place, and following the order of <hi>Psalmes</hi> which they did sing, hauing song this
<pb facs="10"/> funeral and lamentable <hi>Psalme,</hi> which fel out to the verie purpose, without anie special choise made thereof, to wit, the <hi>Psal. 88.</hi> which is the last that was sung in <hi>Orlians</hi> in the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the Church, where amongest other thinges it is said,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I am free among the dead like vnto them that bee wounded and lie in the graue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Also,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thine indignation lyeth hard vppon me, and thou hast vexed me with all thy stormes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As the second preaching was ended, and the <hi>Psalme</hi> aforenamed sung, behold certaine stones throwen against the assemblie, and a Mutenie of people, which then did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a procession, that was made all for the nonce, who rushed vppon the assemblie, which was a godlie assemblie, with an extreme fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and had knocked downe all the troupe, if so be this good God had not raised vp some of the strange souldiers, (which did shew themselues more gentle than the Citizens, thirsting for the bloud of their fellow Citizens,) if they I say, had not couered a great part of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, whereof notwithstanding there were seuenscore slaine and hurt. After dinner, the
<pb facs="10"/> people not being satisfied with this crueltie, did set fire on the Church of <hi>Estape</hi> at noone day with all kind of insolēcie, &amp; disorder▪ threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening the night following, to make a sack of all the Protestantes houses, during which stormes God did amongest other wonderfullie preserue the Ministers which were fiue in number: and namelie the two, who had preached that day as it was said before. Vntil this time the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters notwithstanding the dangers that they had found, couragioslie &amp; by the aduice of the consistorie, and of all the chiefe of the Church, continued in their charge. But this furie being so kindled, and all the Church out of order, &amp; the warres flaming throughout all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>Anguleme</hi> besieged: Then with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultnesse were the Ministers of the said Church drawen out from this furnace, and conducted in safetie. The gates were straitlie kept, and ambushes laid throughout all the waies, and namelie in the crosse streetes: as in deed some of my brethren,<note place="margin">Ministers impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and chiefe &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Ministers of the said Church, <hi>M. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Mason,</hi> otherwise named <hi>Fountane, M. Matthew Berold,</hi> Professor of the Hebrew tongue, and I: wee fell into the handes of our enemies, and there wee remained with most imminent daungers from the <hi>26.</hi> day of <hi>September,</hi> vntill the <hi>15.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/> euen vntill that some notable and well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted persons of the Church, seeing that the people were daily about to drowne or murther vs, and that we had yeelded vnto them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice euen to the vttermost, redeemed vs out of the souldiers handes. Now synce this time, truely this poore Church of <hi>Orlians</hi> was ouerwhelmed with so manie calamities, that a man can not easilie finde the like examples of crueltie, as those which haue beene exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the saide Church, although that in <hi>Fraunce</hi> there hath beene a long time great persecutions,<note place="margin">Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Fraunce vnder An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> namely at <hi>Lyons,</hi> as from the yeare 170. vnder the Empire of <hi>Antonius Verus:</hi> as may be seene in the fifth historie of <hi>Eusebius</hi> the 1.2. and 3. Chap. by the Epistle that the faithfull of <hi>Lyons</hi> wrote thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brethren of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia:</hi> and since these troubles of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the saide citie of <hi>Lyons</hi> hath suffered as much as any other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, especially from the time of these horrible massakers in the yeare of our Lorde 1572. But that which is happened vnto the faithfull of <hi>Orlians,</hi> and hath continued a long time, doth rightly followe that which was song in the last assemblie, as it was saide before in the <hi>88. Psal.</hi> Lorde, thine indignations lie harde vpon mee. For since this first massaker, doone on the fifth of <hi>Septēber</hi> in the yeare 1568. they haue not
<pb facs="11"/> ceased as well in the streats, as in the houses to slay some of the faithfull, to spoyle their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to drawe them with ropes through the streates, not suffering them neither to passe in the citie, nor to liue in the same citie.<note place="margin">The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of houses in 4. places, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Boiblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</note> Such cruelties I say, did continue euen vnto the yeare 1569. vntill the moneth of Iulie, that they did set fire on two houses at noone day, where they had imprisoned more than seuen score of all sortes of qualities and ages, which continued constant in calling vppon the name of God, and in the puritie of his seruice: they I say (alas what spectacle) in presence of this furious inraged people, notwithstanding that prisons ought not to haue bin forced, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing likewise the cries of their wiues, their parentes, and their children,<note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and vnnaturall murther of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones being in prison.</note> were burned all quicke, and if so be the flame had spared any of them, then the bloudie handes of the madde people, or of the souldiers with their holbardes, partisans and kniues would not haue spared them. And as concerning an other troupe of foure score of the faithfull, the most part being citizens of the same citie, which hauing beene locked vp in a great tower of the citie, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine monethes afterwardes (when as they fayned in a morning to bring them forth to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) stabbed in with daggers one after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. O that I could recite these things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

But as our Lorde Iesus Christ, being
<pb facs="12"/> scarce borne, and lodged in a little place at <hi>Bethelem,</hi> forthwith had such kickings and assaults, that he was constrained to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into <hi>Egypt:</hi> euen so the saide Church of <hi>Orlians,</hi> as a man would say being but about to be borne againe, and a litle to gather it selfe together, that shee might knowe her selfe, felt right soone the encountringes and forces of the enemie, the exercise being broken off in the same place for a time through extorted cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and wrasted proclamations, such as we reade to haue beene in the fourth of <hi>Nehemie,</hi> when for a time the building of the Tēple was hindered by one <hi>Sanbulat</hi> and his complices.

   <p>What hope is then there, will some say, or what are these remnantes of the Church, seeing that the greatest part hath beene lead as it were vnto a butcherie or to slaughter: the remnant for the most part forced by impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is in such sort turned and falne away

These are (O alas) the thinges that are most true, and that which hath bin recited, is not the thowsand part of the outrages, violences and miseries which haue come to the said Church. For what tongue can expresse, or what speach can vtter and set forth, so manie lamētable cries as well of women, as of childrē, seeing slaine cruellie before their eyes their husbandes and fathers, as well by enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of their bodies, as of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other such like outrages, that would make the posteritie euen by onelie thinking of it to quake and tremble, and now maketh vs as it were beside our selues, when we doe but by the way make anie mention thereof: as for example, this preface can not bee a full laying out, of such lamentable Tragedies: neither is it my meaning at this time, leauing those to intreate of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more at large, that can doe it better, &amp; with an higher stile, and that are better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all the particularities, than I can be.</p>
   <p>But this is to the end that wee may now see, and as it were put into the ballance, on the one side the afflictions and miseries
<pb facs="14"/> of the said Church: And againe on the other part, may see the consolations wherewith the scriptures haue furnished vs, to the end we should know whether we haue occasion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to droupe and to lose our courage, as alas to my great sorrow, I see that manie haue done: and not rather euen to stirre vp through our prayers those mercies and bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion in the diuine Maiestie.

By which wordes it is shewed vnto vs, that it is a great wisedome, rightlie to marke the proceedings of our God, and to vnderstand the end of them, as well in his promises, as in his threateninges: for they be alwayes iust and right, and there are none but Infidels and wicked men, which stumble and fall in them.

Although then that sometimes, stormes, tempestes and calamities bee so extreme as it seemeth, that there is no more face neither anie tract or footing of a Church on the earth, and moreouer that GOD hath left his house, and as it were altogether forsaken his heritage, and as it might be, leauing the welbeloued of his soule, in the handes of his enemies: (Loe the verie wordes, that the Lord vseth in the <hi>12.</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie:</hi>) yet will hee dailie haue as it is said in the <hi>6.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Esaiah</hi>) a tenth part: And the Church shal bee made bare as a Birch, or as an Oke when they shall cast their leaues, and yet there shall be substance within, euen so shall bee the substance of the Church, a holie seede.

But men feare not sinne which maketh a diuision betwixt God and vs: and the reward thereof, bee all afflictions, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ruines, which wee doe see fall out in the compasse of the whole worlde. Men complaine enough of their losses, of their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and pouerties: but how fewe are there that frame their complaintes against their vices, against their falshood &amp; infidelitie, against their impatiēce, against their couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, against their ambition, &amp; such like wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse?

How would it bee then, if this life were left vnto vs altogether quiet, sweete and delectable? Who would remember the kingdome of heauen? Who would euer aspire vnto Christ, and vnto the glorious and euerlasting life? Go to then, let vs acknowledge the vanitie of
<pb facs="17"/> our thoughtes, and in steede of vexing our selues and fainting, let vs woonder at the diuine prouidence: acknowledging that then his helpes are more neere at hand, when it seemeth that GOD is farthest off from vs. As <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iewe</hi> once answered his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, when as he had an ill answere of the Emperor <hi>Caius,</hi> towards whom hee had bin sent, to intreate for the <hi>Iewes.</hi>

Surely some for the most part looke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to men, &amp; to the helpes of men, thā to the Lord God of Hostes, of whom a man may say that which is spoken in the <hi>4.</hi> of the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ieremie</hi> the prophet, that their eies are consumed with waiting for a vaine helpe, &amp; for
<pb facs="18"/> looking after an emptie hope, for looking for a nation that neither would, nor could saue thē. But it is saide in the 3. of <hi>Sophonie,</hi> I will cause a poore &amp; an afflicted people, to remaine in the middest of thee, and they shall trust in the name of the Lorde. See him, on whō we must looke, with true faith, amending so great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, that are in the midst of the Churches, by feruent &amp; cōstant calling on his holy name. Moreouer others in steede of awaiting on the Lorde, and in place of taking aduersities, as a warning from the diuine maiestie, these were (&amp; that alas, in great nūber) stronglie throwne downe into the puddle of Idolatrie with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,<note place="margin">Reuolt or turning backe.</note> throwen downe say I, yea and rushed in, euen as a furious horse rusheth into a battaile: so that they carie there all the sway, &amp; in whō there is founde greater eagernesse after Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and towardes all kinde of iniquitie, than in those old Idolaters, who all their life long haue beene nourished vp therein. I speake it with teares &amp; in deepe sorrowe of heart, to be most true: for I did see those which were of the same troupe and band, which did goe with vs vnto the holy assemblies, to whom God had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die giuen fauour to ouercome manie assaultes, nowe to bee so wandering and giuen ouer to a spirit of darke vnderstanding. O what other thing then are all men liuing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie!
<pb facs="18"/> O how true is this which is spoken in the <hi>17.</hi> of <hi>Ieremie:</hi> That the heart of man is false and full of deceite, and as it is saide in the fifth Chap. of the same prophet: O Lorde, are not thy eies on the trueth? Thou hast striken them, and they haue not sorrowed: Thou hast consumed them, but they haue refused to receiue thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline: They haue made their faces more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than a stone, and they haue refused to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto thee. <hi>Feare ye not me,</hi> (sayth the Lorde)? <hi>Or will ye not be afraid at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</hi> O howe much more happie were they which passed into the foure cornerd house, and into other places, as it were true golde through the fire, constantlie calling vppon the Lorde, than those which burned them quicke, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after Idolatrie, and the vanitie of the worlde, taking the way to that fire, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall be quenched. But what? As it is saide in the <hi>8.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Shall he which is fallen not rise againe? Or hee which is turned awaie, shall hee not turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Ah my brethren, I hope yet there will manie be founde, who will say: What haue we doone? And there shall be of those of whome <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> speaketh in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise cōcerning those which are fallen, whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were rather ouercome than their heart. Although that this saying of <hi>Tertulliā</hi> is more
<pb facs="19"/> true,<note place="margin">In his book de corona militis.</note> that is to say, that in the matter of faith, and religion, this excuse of necessitie &amp; of force can haue no place: as if of necessitie one might be compelled to do any thing against his religiō.<note place="margin">Nonecessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to euill.</note> For no necessitie ought to be pretended to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, forasmuch as there is (saieth he) but one necessity that ought to cōmand vs, &amp; which is simplie necessary, to wit, to obey our God. If there be any thing therfore that should feare man, or should lay any necessity by enforcemēt vpō him, it is the greatnesse and terrour of that which is most great and terrible, that is to say: of the liuing and euerlasting God. If there were any allurement, pleasure or commoditie, that ought to drawe a man, it is the riuer of the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, they be the promises of euerlasting trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and of the life to come: which if we tasted were it neuer so litle, all the world with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light should be nothing vnto vs. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a faithfull man is greater and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than this worlde, being the childe of God and an inheritour of him &amp; a coheire with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. See wherfore such a one desireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the worlde, but his whole life is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and forsaking of the world. If the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be of punishments, banishments, or other penalties: they are not miserable which dy or be in banishment for the name of Christ: but they who, howsoeuer they yet liue, and are in their
<pb facs="19"/> pallaces in the middest of all their delightes, are iudged and condemned by the word of God, and by the lawes thereof: being guiltie and worthie of a thousand deathes, &amp; of a thousand banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as for example these murtherers, ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and other such like are, who haue their handes embrued in the bloud of our brethren.

Furthermore, if we doe feele our selues verie weake, to sustaine the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, threateninges and feares amongest cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Idolaters: why doe we tempt God, in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling amongest them?<note place="margin">

Howe many meanes might a man haue had since this fiue yeares, to haue retired himselfe from amongest these fleshlie people, so thirstie after the bloud of the faithfull?

We are in this worlde to knowe and serue God: and the time of our life being so short, ought we not to enforce our selues to the vttermost to bestowe that as well as is possible? For as <hi>S.

Nowe my brethren,<note place="margin">Whence infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</note> considering that these great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are at this day founde in many, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from no other thing, but onely through default of not being well grounded and rooted in the faith, and also because we pray not vnto God,<note place="margin">

For this is our glorie,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> euen of vs all which haue beene your Pastors, the testimonie of our conscience, that in simplicitie and godlie purenesse wee haue beene conuersant amongest you, preaching vnto you the word of God. And wee are not ignorant, in meane while that this is an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient subtiltie and craft of the Diuel, and of the wicked,<note place="margin">The slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> in the middest of their greatest wickednesse, to slaunder good men, and the trueth. So was <hi>Elias</hi> slaundered by <hi>Achab,</hi> as a seditious person, so was Iesus Christ char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with faultes. So did that abhominable <hi>Nero,</hi> who hauing set the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, layd all the fault vpon the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Wee doe not doubt at all, but a man
<pb facs="21"/> may finde some of our renegates, which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the seruice to the contrarie side, and to reape the benefite of a flattering tongue, both haue and doe straine themselues to misuse vs in speach: and not onely with the like speach falselie to misuse vs, but also to make odious euen the whole doctrine of the holie Gospell. But he whome we doe serue knoweth vs, and we call none other but the conscience of those who haue hard vs, and haue seene our behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in witnesse of our affection towards you, &amp; of our chearefulnesse and readines, wherewith all we haue beene alway accōpanied, preaching vnto you the pure word of God, so much as was possible for vs, and that you could be suffered to heare the same. The worlde hath also seene &amp; knowen of long time the impieties of this seat of <hi>Rome:</hi> many Emperours, yea and many kinges of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> haue prooued their insolencie, and crueltie. <hi>Fraunce,</hi> alas, seeth at this day the detestable vntrustinesse, treasons, violences, and murthers, the like not hearde, which that Apostaticall Romish seate hath bredde and brought forth vnto vs, and for the which they haue many times made bonfires, yea and great triumph: but all in vaine: wee shall weepe and the worlde shall laugh: in the meane time our heauinesse shall one way bee turned into ioy which the world shall not be able to spoile vs of.
<pb facs="21"/> And how much better shall it bee to weepe in this world than in the other, and to reioyce in the life to come, than in this vale of miseries? The order then that wee keepe in this booke is,<note place="margin">The order kept in this booke,</note> that wee drawe to the Articles of the faith, as close as is possible, certaine places of the holie scripture which serue best to explane them, and make them cleare, with prayers and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations to that purpose, to the end that as faith and prayer ought to be ioyned together, so euerie one might bee resolued in the faith, &amp; be pricked forward to prayer. True it is that in that which tyed me to those prayers and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations which were before imprinted, I haue not altogether kept such order as I desired: neuerthelesse, these prayers nowe are brought into a better order, than those that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and are augmented with manie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie places. And this booke will serue as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Manuel, to the end to teach euerie one to see euerie houre of the day, and euerie Moneth of the yeare, that is to say continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie what hee ought to beleeue and meditate vpon: as also, what was the whole Catechisme or maner of instruction of youth vsed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, like as <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth in his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> that is to say, in his Manuel, that it contained the meaning and exposition of the Creede and the Lordes prayer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="22"/> I hope that this little treatise so reuiewed and digested into such order, will serue not onelie to direct vs, how to make our prayers, for all kinde of necessities and wantes, but also for an instruction, more and more to confirme those that are the true faithfull, in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal pointes of our saluation, whereby the true Church of God is discerned from that false and bastard Church, which wanteth both true faith,<note place="margin">
