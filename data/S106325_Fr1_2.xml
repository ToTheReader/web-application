   <head>TO THE REDER</head>
   <p>EFTER the executioun of Maister Iohn Kello minister of Spot (weilbelouit reder) my purpois was not to haue put in writ ye cō fessioun of his horribill offence, quhilk he maid vpon the Scaffald, not lang befoir his sufferring, and wald rather haue wissit (for my awin part) the memorie thereof to haue bene buryit, than be ony mannis industrie and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouris sa wickit exempill continuit to ye po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie. For I was maist assurit that his godly and vnfeynit repentance▪ had sa blottit furth the memorie of his offence from ye hartis of all sic that sciris God, that my pen culd serue na thing towardis thame, bot to ingraft greter dolour and lamentatioun in thair hartis. And as for the wickit I did esylie persaif hair har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis sa obstinatly indurit aganis ye iudgementis of God, that howsaeuer I wryte the treuth suld be exponit be yame in contempt &amp; moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage. Quhilk thing albeit I was assurit of, ʒit did I neuer suspect, that ony of the vngodly and enemeis of the treuth suld sa far aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun his awin corruptit conscience, as to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report
<pb facs="3"/>
      the haill procedingis of this mater in vther Natiounis, and thereby to traduce the vndoutit treuth of Christis Euangell. And thairsoir quhen it come to my knawledge yat sindrie of the poysonit sect of the Antichrist, had not only writtin in vther countreis of yis murther, keiping alwayis silence of his vnfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit and ernist repentance, but lykewise by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers licētious and vngodly Picturis laubourit to withdraw ye simpill frō Godis obedience, &amp; Irreuerently spak of the seruandis of God. I thocht it my dewtie to oppone myself vnto thair maist vngodly and blasphemous calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis, and to intrert the mater planely as it was that yai to quhais eiris the rumour of yis fact suld cum micht be ye better informit to with stand the wickitnes of thame quhais principal cair is that God in his word may be dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Nether do I sa wryte to this intent, that albeit his lyfe had bene wickit, and continuit sa to the end, that the puritie of Godis treuth culd haue bene thairby defylit, na mair than ye traterous defectioun of Judas culd mak ye word of lyfe vnsauerie to yame quha confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit Iesus to be the Sone of the Euerlasting God. Bot that euerie ane may vnderstād, yat sic exempillis as thay abuse to mantene super<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stitioun seruis cheifly to the aduancement of
<pb facs="3"/>
      Godis glorie. For this wald I leirne at ony of thame, gif thay be abill to mak thair profite farther of this Tragedie, then Satan him self; quhais counsellis be his godly repētance was confoundit, and ye pray quhilk he had in ane maner deuorit be Godis prouydēce preseruit from his tyrannie, gif God disapointit ye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iniquitie, how can his children erect this baner to ye mantenāce of his Kingdome? Bot that the treuth may the mair euidently appeir, I will schortlie comprehend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessioun quhilk he maid befoir his sufferring, in presence of the haill pepill than asse nbillit ofter he had maid his prayer humblie to God</p>
