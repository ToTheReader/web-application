                 <title>An antidote against popery : confected out of Scriptures, Fathers, councels, and histories. VVherein dialogue-wise are shewed, the points, grounds, and antiquitie of the Protestant religion; and the first springing vp of the points of popery: together with the Antichristianisme thereof. Being alone sufficient to inable any Protestant of meane capacitie, to vnderstand and yeeld a reason of his religion, and to incounter with and foyle the aduersary.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, thou mayest haply blame mee for my ouer-diligence in writing-so much, and now vpon a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect so throughly canuased already in diuers bookes of learned Authors. But know, that I haue beene drawne to doe this by the sollicitation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th of my selfe to interrupt my course in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tract, which I haue begung,<note place="margin">Treasury of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles-expositions.</note> and to perfect which will require the whole life and labour. of one whole man. Many haue written so I grant, in this argument, as that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this of mine without all compare: but some are so large and haue made their bookes to swell to so great volumes, as that they are onely for professed Students, and not for euery mans memory, leyfure or money. Some againe are so short, and doe so prosecute some points onely, as that howsoeuer they be for euery man, yet when they are read, almost euery man remaineth still vnsatisfied in many things. Lastly, some are neither too large, nor too short, but haue written fully, methodically, and logically: yet not so fully, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers particulars haue beene omitted, the common motiues on both sides haue not beene so throughly weighed, the originalls of the many e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rours of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Apostolike Antiquity of the Reformed Religion hath not beene so declared, nor the treatises in the manner of them so fitted to the capacity of the vulgar, so as that many read them, but for want of capacity, and through these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb facs="6"/>in the worke, are not so much moued. Now to supply all these defects, and to instruct all, euen my most vncapable Country-men in euery point and motiue, so as that there might be nothing to hinder those that desire to know the truth, and to cleaue vnto and obey it; I haue written this plaine and short Dialogue. And herein I am not so blind but I see to what enuying and hard censuring I expose my selfe, but neither credit, nor life are any thing to me, so that by any meanes I may saue some: Onely let mee say thus much in way of Apologie, that it is well knowne, that I am not malicious against the Romane Catholikes, nor out of spite haue thus written or vsed the name of <hi>Elymas</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace any but wilfull Pontificians, who for sinister respects, against their knowledge seeke to lead into error not onely common people, but noble gouernors, that attentiuely hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching. For the rest let mee intreat you to read me, not as an enemy, vnlesse I shall therefore bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your enemy,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.16.</note>
      <hi>because I tell you the truth;</hi> but as one that desireth and prayeth for your saluation; and I doubt not, but through Gods grace, you shall see that, which will make you suspect, and not so well to like your present estate, nor so much to condemne our reformation, if not to separate your selues, and to come out with vs from amongst them, lest ye perish euerlastingly. For I professe before God, who knoweth all secrets, that till I seriously studied vpon these things, I was not so resolued, that the Pope is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, nor your tenents and superstitions so damnable: but the further I waded into this study, the more was I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, so as that now I make no further doubt of it. And therefore my hope is, that the like effect may by reading these my meditations bee wrought in others also, that the vnstable may be setled, and the erring bee brought home into the one sheepfold of Christ, before it be too late, which God grant vnto you all for his mercies sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
