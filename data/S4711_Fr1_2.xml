      </gap> Worshipfull, sinking into mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and compared with the many<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fold curtesies, which continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

and commoditie hath incensed &amp; set me on fire, though not as I woulde, yet as I could, to shewe some manifest signe and argument, that I haue your Worshippes goodnesse in freshe and dailie memorie: which although I dare not vowe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, yet wil I do what I can in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to deserue.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe therefore, Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in the meane time, since I haue no pretious mines, to accept and like wel of this my simple mite: simple I confesse in common valuation: but pretious I dare a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ch, in sound iudgement and reason. A booke it is which a kinsman of mine, not so neere as deere vnto mee, at my vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent request bestowed vpon mee in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for my priuate vse, and peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</p>
   <p>Wherof when I had marked the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and sawe that to communicate the same vnto the flocke of the faithfull, were much better, and more thankswor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, than to keepe it at home in my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer impounded as my proper possession, and portion of my patrimonye: I was won and perswaded, at the importunate sute and instance of sundrie my trustie friends, who vpon circumspect perusing of the same, gaue it due and deserued commendation, to consent and agree, <hi>Authore agrè serente, &amp; prosus inuito,</hi> that
<pb facs="3"/>
it should bee published for the common benefite of the multitude.</p>
   <p>Very loth I was, I speake my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to offend my kinsman and friend in anye pointe of presumption: and muche more loath, I vtter my secret thought, to greeue any godlie and deuout soule, by detaining any thinge, the vse whereof might increase their comfort. But beyng assaulted, as I was, incessantlie, with ve hement perswasions and not able with al my fiue wits, to withstand their weakest reason, I became willing to bee ordered and ruled, as they by discretion mighte dispose me in so honest a request.</p>
   <p>The same not in writing, Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful, as I had it: but in printe, as you haue it, being the firstlings of a Cheshire wit, gathered in a famous seedeplot of great learning and profound knowledge I present vnto you with suche submission as beseemeth an inferiour to his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a clyent to his patrone, a welwiller to his benefactor.</p>
   <p>Beseeching you, of your accustomed curtesie, that as you haue from time to time beene, not onely an earnest sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and furtherer of godlie and zealous men, but also a supporter and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vertuous and Christian meanings so it would please you with your title of credit and countenance, as with a shield,
<pb facs="4"/>
to defend this religious worke, againste the dartes of the malicious: that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped with so strong a piller, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with such fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>iture of munition and defense, it may haue safe conduct and free passage, euen through the middest of Gods enimies, and so come to the hands of the wel disposed and deuout.</p>
   <p>Thus abruptlie concluding, I commit your Worship, and al yours, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and safegard of him, who neuer faileth his, the Lord God almightie, who as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath, so hereafter he will, euen vntil the day of your death, I doubt not blesse you with the dew of heauen, I meane his grace: wherevnto I say Amen.</p>
