   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I considered with my selfe (gentle Reader) the great calamitie, miserie, and most distressed state of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, on which it hath pleased God to inflict the heauie scourge of his wrath, by imposing on them that poysonous infection the plague, I therefore (as one partaker of their griefe and sorrowe) seeing also the same contagion so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dispersed throughout this land, and not finding anye english author that hath to my content written the meanes how to preserue and keepe vs from the contagion thereof, haue thought it good to publish this small treatise vnder the title and name of a defensatiue against the Plague. Which worke I haue collected and drawne from sundrie both aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and later writers, the which being shaddowed vnder the calme shroude of auncient consent, and strengthned with the abundant sappe of late experience (as well mine owne, as others) I heere present the same, not so exquisitely plotted with so orderly a method, or so finely pollished with so filed an eloquence, thereby to breede a delight to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which would be a loathing to the vnlearned, I haue therefore thought best to disclose it, euen in the playnest manner I could deuise, whereby the simpler sort might reape the commoditie thereof, whose safetie I tender, and for whose sakes I haue taken this paynes. I doubt not but that
<pb facs="5"/>
some (<hi>Aristarchus</hi> or other) whose filthie stomackes being inflamde with malice, will attempt to nip off the crop of my future hope, obiecting the barrennes of my soyle wherein it first tooke roote, and my want of skill in trimming and proy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it as it would require to be such, as small hope of frute is to be loked for to proceede thereof, but high disdaine wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no man good, I giue them leaue to glose as they list, knowing it most friuolous to afford vnto such an answere, seeing in stead of reason there commeth nothing from them but either a disdainefull smile, or a scornefull mocke (but it skilleth not) sith many of my ancients haue tasted of their mallice, whome I may iustly compare to <hi>Antiphilos,</hi> that peerelesse pickthancke. Only vppon this hope do I rest, that as in good will and loue I haue done it, so the well disposed will censure it in the best sort, and where defects are (as I doubt not of many) they will in friendly and charitable manner correct and amend the same, which may occasion me to take some further paynes heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Farewell. From my house this 25. of March. 1593.</p>
