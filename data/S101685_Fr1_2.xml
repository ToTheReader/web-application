      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>POLIE IT MAYE BE
thought in me to haue spent
tyme in englisshyng of this
boke, entitled <hi>the praise of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
wheras the name it selfe
semeth to set foorth no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or matter of grauitee:
vnlesse perhappes <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
the autour therof, delited to
mocke men, in callyng it one
thyng, and meanyng an other. To this I answeare,
that Folie in all poinct{is} is not (as I take it) so strange
vnto vs, but that hir name maie well be abidden, aslong
as will we or nill we, she will be sure to beare a stroke
in most of our dooyng{is}: how so euer a certaine secte
of faulte finders condemne all thing{is}, that fully square
not with theyr owne rules, yea twyse blinde in this,
that among{is} the commen errours and infyrmitees of
mortall men, they will beare nothyng with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne,
as who saieth, they were demigodd{is}, and not
more than one or two waies lynked in Folies band{is}.</p>
   <p>I haue therfore bestowed an englisshe liuerey vpon this
latine boke, as well as I coulde: not so muche to please
all men, as rather to shew how euin this Foly toucheth
all men. Wherin I woulde not be noted as a carper of
any man particulerly (for what more vnsittyng than in
bokes or plaies to touche men by name?) nor that herein
I seke to haue any kinde of men noted for theyr trade of
lyfe, otherwyse than the abuse thereof deserueth, but
<pb facs="3"/>
onely my meanyng is suche, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> in this booke
shall expresse for vs bothe. He of his modestee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to set no great face vpon it, nor woulde be noted to
haue spent great labour in makyng therof: sauyng as
in pastime to haue essaied, whether ought might be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in praise of Folie, wheras wysedome the vertue
can praise it selfe. And therfore he imagineth, that
Folie shoulde be a Goddesse, who before all kyndes of
men assembled as to a sermon, shoulde declare how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefites they receiue at hir hand{is}: and how with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hir accesse, nothyng in this life is delectable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
or tollerable vnto vs, no not our owne life.</p>
   <p>This braue bost myght well come from Folie: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
that wyser men are wont to take in woorth what
is saied by a foole, therfore is <hi>Erasmus</hi> also the bolder
to put that tale in Folies mouth, whiche vnder an other
person he woulde haue made more curtesie to haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
So what excuse he maketh the same I requyre
maie serue for me: that thyng{is} spoken foolisshely, by
Folie, maie be euin so taken, and not wrested to any bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sence or ernest applicacion. For surely if the crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedst
men that be, are wont to take a fooles woord{is} as
in sporte, for feare lest others myght recken they would
not wynche without a galled backe: Than how muche
more is a domme booke written generally to be borne
withall? namely where the title pretendeth no graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
but rather a toye to stirre laughter, without offence
in the boke, if the reader bringe none offence with hym.
For than truely he maie chaunce to see his owne image
more liuely described than in any peincted table.</p>
   <p>But if that waies he mislike the deformitee of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaicte,
<pb facs="3"/>
let hym muche more mislyke to be suche one
in deede. And seeyng the vices of our daies are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as can not enough be spoken against, what knowe
we, if <hi>Erasmus</hi> in this booke thought good betweene
game and ernest to rebuke the same? And chiefely to
persuade (if it myght be) a certaine contentacion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man, to holde hym agreed with suche lotte and
state of liuyng, as ariseth to hym. For whiche pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was I also soonest moued to englisshe it, to the end
that meane men of baser wittes and condicion, myght
haue a maner coumfort and satisfaction in theim selfes.
In as muche as the hie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> god, who made vs all of one
earth, hath natheles ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>en some to rule, and more to
serue. Wherat so muche lacketh that the inferiours
shoulde repine, as rather set in the meaner degree, they
should thanke god the more: without aspyryng to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
aboue theyr reache, whiche should draw more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and perilles, than if they absteigned therfro, and
gaue place to others, who had greater giftes of God,
and were called by auctoritee of theyr prince or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to welde the same. For surely, if a man of the
poorer sorte, whose eies is dased in beholdyng the fayre
glosse of wealth and felicitee, whiche the state of a great
lorde or counsailour in a commen wealth dooeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
represent, did inwardly marke the trauailes,
cares, and anxietees, whiche suche one is driuen to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steigne
(doyng as he ought to dooe) in seruyng his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and countrey, wherby he is nothyng lesse than his
owne man: now I beleue he would not muche enuie his
state, nor chose to chaunge condicions of life with hym.
But this were euin the chiefest poincte of wysedome,
<pb facs="4"/>
though fooles (as Folie calleth theim) that is to saie
vulgare folke, are those, that vnwittyng of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
dooe in deede enioie this sweete quietnesse, and
greatest good tourne. And waiyng this foolishe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oke,
after this sence, I wene a profite also maie arise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
to the readers, besides the delectacion, beyng so
pithilie pleasaunt as it is. For as <hi>Erasmus</hi> in all his
woorkes sauoureth of a liuelie quicknesse, and spareth
not sometyme in graue mattiers to sprincle his style,
where he maie suache oportunitee with meerie concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sentences: so in this booke, treatyng of suche a
<hi>Theme,</hi> and vnder suche a person, he openeth all his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>owget: So farfoorth as by the iudgement of many
learned men, he neuer shewed more arte, nor witte, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the grauest boke he wrote, than in this his praise of
Folie. Whiche the reader hauyng any considerance,
shall soone espie, how in euery mattier, yea almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clause, is hidden besides the myrth, some deaper sence
and purpose. In deede I againe saie not, but he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Folie to speake at randon, without sparyng of any
estate of men: but yet indifferent eares will heare their
faultes paciently, as long as they maie chose, whether
they will take the faulte vppon theim or not: or be a
knowne to be those, whom Folie noteth. But euin
this frankenesse of Folies taunting I haue presumed in
some poinctes to ytche to the beste: namely in two or
thre places, whiche the learned reader comparyng with
the latine boke, maie easely perceiue, how either I haue
slipped ouer a line or two, or eased the sowre sence of
the latine with some manerlier englishe worde. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I chose rather to be counted a skante true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb facs="4"/>
than otherwise to touche thynges, whiche were
better vnsaied, as long as it hurted not the grace of the
boke though they were omitted. Likewise in all my
translacion I haue not peined my selfe to render worde
for woorde, nor prouerbe for prouerbe, wherof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be greke, such as haue no grace in our tounge:
but rather markyng the sence. I applied it
to the phrase of our englishe. And
where the prouerbes woulde take
no englishe, I aduentured to put
englisshe prouerbes of like
waight in their plac{is},
Whiche maie be
thought by
some
cunnyng translatours a deadly sinne. But
I sticke not for all that, in this foolishe
booke to vse mine owne foolishe
caste. And if it be misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
I passe not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
though I lose
the praise of
my Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
