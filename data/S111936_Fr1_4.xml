Bicause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> any such a one, should finde great profite therby: for why, in déed it is an excelent comfort against any kynd of calamitie. But surely if it happen into the hands of some such as I know: it wil be estéemed euē as pearle among swyne, &amp; so to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled eyther to frye in the fyre, or els to rotte vppon the donghell. This (gentle Reader) is the cause of my feare: for that in the translatyng of it, I dyd fynde so precyous a
<pb facs="7"/>
Iewel therof as for a certeintie, if I should by fortune sée it so euilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, it would bryng mée into an excéeding griefe &amp; collor for the same: the cause why, is for that I am in a merueylous loue therewith, for the great profit I haue had therby. This tyme twelue moneth by the greate goodnesse of God, I was visited with a gréeuous sicknes, the which (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a one can tell) did tye and compell me to kéepe my bed and chamber viij. or ix. wéekes, I had read this booke in Spanish diuers times before, and had begunne to translate a parte thereof, the which, with the whole matter (deare friendes) in the booke contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was no small pleasure for mée to remember: Surely it was my excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comfort. I vowed then to finish the translation therof, the which now I thanke God is done &amp; ended, with a generall publication therof among you: beséeching you and euerie of you to whose handes it shall come, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vse it diligētly ouer, that ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly haue the same in mynde, so that

if néed be, you may therby receiue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, &amp; answere in my behalfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst as many as shall reprooue mée in myne absence for my trauail ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. I am sure that some will reprooue me and say, <hi>quam quisque norit artem, in hac se exerceat,</hi> let euerie man exercyse him selfe in the arte or facultie which he knoweth, <hi>Sed stultus stulta loquitor,</hi> but a foole speaketh foolish things. And therfore as one that passeth not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what be sayd against me by any of them, I doe banish all feare and waxe sturdie, considering that <hi>Audaces fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Iuuat,</hi> fortune helpeth men of good courage, for <hi>Timidi nunquam Statuerunt ad tropheum,</hi> cowerdes neuer got vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. And therefore as one thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened, I rest to abyde the batterie of any assalter whatsoeuer, trustyng of your ayde as necessitie requyreth, the which if I haue, you make me yet more boulder to gyue a greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
