   <head>¶ To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>IT shall not be necessary for me (most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brethren) to shewe anye causes for mine own excuse why I haue attempted the setting forth of this little <hi>Catechisme,</hi> as though I had rashly aduentured aboue that was méete, to set forth any thing to be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by my priuate aduise: Or as though I had presumed aboue mine abilitye to become so general a teacher, hauing my self so meane vnderstandyng. For in these daies in which there is so great licentiousnes of printyng bookes, as in déede it maketh vs all the worse, who can blame it that hath any taste or sauer of goodnes, be it neuer so simple, if it had no other fruite, yet this is great and plentyfull, that in reading it we shoulde keepe our eyes from much godles and childish vanitie, that hath now blotted so many papers. We sée it all, and we mourne for griefe, so many as in spirite and truth do loue the Lord. What multitude of bookes, full of all synne and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, haue nowe filled the world? No thing so childish, nothing so vaine, nothing so wanton, nothyng so ydle, whych is not both boldly printed, and plausibly taken. So that herein we haue fulfilled the wickednes of our forefathers, &amp; ouertaken them in theyr syns.
<pb facs="3"/>
They had their spiritual enchauntmentes, in which they were bewytched, <hi>Beuis</hi> of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>Guy</hi> of Warwike, <hi>Arthur</hi> of the round table, <hi>Huon</hi> of Burdeaux, <hi>Oliuer</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, the foure sonnes of <hi>Amond,</hi> and a great many other of such childish follye. And yet more vanitie then these, the witles deuices of <hi>Gargantua, Howleglas, Esop, Robyn Hoode, Adam Bel,</hi> Frier <hi>Rushe,</hi> the Fooles of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and a thousand such other. And yet of all the residue the most dronken imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which they so defiled their Festiual and high holydaies, their <hi>Legendawry,</hi> theyr Saintes lyues, their tales of <hi>Robyn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,</hi> and of manye other Spirites, which Satan had made, Hell had printed, and were warranted vnto sale vnder the Popes priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to kindle in mens hartes the sparkes of superstition, that at last it might flame out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire of Purgatorie. These were in the former daies the subtile sleightes of Satan to occupye Christian wyts in Heathen fansies. And we as men that can not learne wisedom by anye examples to kéepe our selues from harme, but as though the wickednes of our forefathers were not yet full, we wyll make vp their measure, and set vp Shrines to the woord of God, and the wrytinges of all hys Saintes, which our forefathers had cast out
<pb facs="3"/>
of all honor, that their own dreames and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions might be had in price. To thys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I trow we haue multiplied for our selues so many new delightes that we might iustefy the idolatrous superstitiō of the elder world. To this purpose we haue printed vs many bawdy songes (I am lothe to vse such a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some woord, saue that it is not fyt inough for so vile endeuours,) to this purpose we haue gotten our Songes &amp; Sonets, our Pallaces of pleasure, our vnchaste Fables and Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and such lyke Sorceries, moe then any man may recken. Yea some haue ben so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as new borne <hi>Moabites,</hi> which wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their own vomit, and haue not bene a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shamed to entitle their bookes, The Court of <hi>Venus,</hi> The Castle of Loue, and manye such other as shamelesse as these. O that there were among vs some zealous <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <note place="margin">Act. 19. 29.</note> bookes of so great vanity might be burned vp. The spirite of God wrought in them so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, that they contemned the price of so great iniquitie, in one Citie, and at one fire they brought together the bookes valued to twoo thousand markes, and burnt them al at once. O happy light &amp; cleare as the Sun beames, if we might sée the lyke in <hi>London,</hi> that the chiefe streete might be sanctified with so holy sacrifice. The place it selfe doth craue it, and
<pb facs="4"/>
holdeth vp a gorgeous Idoll, a fyt stake for so good a fire. O Lord thou art able to woorke what thou wylt, let vs sée this day that <hi>Iacob</hi> may reioyce, and <hi>Israel</hi> may be glad. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thine enemies, as they haue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced thée. Of old they <note n="a" place="margin">Iere. 36. 23</note> burnt the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thy Prophets, and in their ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing they departed not from the synnes of their fathers, but gaue the <note n="b" place="margin">An. dom. 290. sub Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, et anno. 1559 sub Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. 4.</note> holy labours of thy Saintes vnto ashes, nowe let vs sée the iust recompence of anger, and make our good Rulers the instruments to execute thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. We haue now long inough played with our own fansies, Lord rayse vp agayne thy word into honour, that our eyes may be occupied in holy readinges.</p>
   <p>And you deare Brethren that are yet in battail to fight against Satan, pray and cease not, that God alone maye be exalted in our daies, that Satan may be troden vnder foote, and that the woord of God, the strong weapen of our strife, may be geuen into the handes of all, that their lyfe may be in safetie. And be perswaded of this, that there is no one thyng more enemy to the woord of God, then these vaine and synfull imaginations of our owne vnbridled wits, which haue now filled so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny volumes. And therefore I trust I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue no blame to aduenture the setting out
<pb facs="4"/>
of this short enstruction, sithe my desire is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aduance Gods glory, and edefie hys poore Church, that is yet so couered in darke ignorance: when so many haue found leaue to spread abroad their labours, that haue no other pleasure then offyn and wyckednes.</p>
   <p>Now for that that I haue taken vpon mee to set forth vnto many this enstruction, beare with me, I beseche you, and praye vnto God that we may all together hold the humblenes of mynde that was in Christ Iesu, that we be not wise in our own conceits, nor thincke of our selues aboue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which is conuenient, but acknowledging the blindnes of our hart, and the ignorance in which we are borne, we may say with the most happy Apostle, we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we haue not receiued. And of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other I do willyngly professe it, I am the least, but by the grace of God I am that I am, and I trust hys grace is not in vayne in me. But this that I here present vnto the Church of God, I haue not done it alone: but another faithfull labourer in the woorke of the Lord, and a good brother in Christ Iesu, whom God hath endued with great knowledge, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with much vnderstanding, he hath taken the greatest paine, and the greatest fruit must grow of his labours. So that I haue not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured of my selfe, but haue onely bene an
<pb facs="5"/>
helper of an other mans labour. And the cause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hath mooued vs both is suche, as hath made the Children of God euen to faynt in their mourning, vntil they shall sée the great mercies of God to take awaye the cause of their griefe. We sée the great ignorance in which the people are euery wher couered, the cloudes of darknes, more then the darknes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> haue so ouer shadowed them, that the light of the Gospel of the glorye of Christ, who is the Image of God, it doth hardlye or not at all shine in their vnbeleuing hartes.</p>
   <p>Scarce one of a great many can giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their faith, yet <hi>S. Peter</hi> requireth it of <note place="margin">3. Pet. 4. 13</note> euery Christian. A very few haue tasted the beginninges of the Gospel of Christ, and yet <hi>S. Paule</hi> biddeth that the word dwel plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note> in eche one of our hartes. The Apostle blameth the ignoraunce of the people, who haue learned yet no further, then repentance from dead workes, and the first enstructions of the faith toward God: But O Lord, howe <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> many thousands of vs, of fayth and of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce can say nothyng? The Prophet speaketh of the kyngdome of Christ, that in those daies the earth should be ful of the know <note place="margin">Esa. 11. 19</note> ledge of the Lord, as the waters that do couer the sea: where is now that blessed spirite of vnderstandyng to be poored vpon vs? And
<pb facs="5"/>
wher is this riches of the knowledge of God? Are not rather the multitude of our brethren clothed with darknes, so that they grope in their wayes as at midnight, &amp; know nothing of the way of lyfe? We pray dayly according as we are taught, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,</hi> if we speake not like the Parets, in woordes without vnderstanding, then this is our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: let thy spirite beare rule in our hartes, and the knowledge of thy woorde lighten the eyes of our mynde. And what do we then els but dally with the Lord, if we pray styll for knowledge, and yet sleepe stil in ignorance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Then thys is (louing Brethren) a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for our boldnes, if in so great necessitye, according to our talentes, we séeke to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto many.</p>
   <p>If any thinke that there are already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently set forth many <hi>Catechismes,</hi> I do easely graunt it, but they are not sufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither yet can be. For it was necessary in the best and most godlye of these labours, whilest the Christian faith is plainly taught, to edifiyng of the simple, and conuincing of the aduersary, that the faithful teacher should vse moe wordes, then can be caried in mynde of the ignorant man. And therefore I thought itgood as briefly as I could, to comprehende the effect of all, that the begynninges beyng
<pb facs="6"/>
made playne, and easely printed in memory, we might enter into reasoning and disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our selues, enstructing one another, and helping one an other, that we might haue the more fruit in the lōger labours of others, but most of all that we might be encouraged to the most holy and liuely woord of God, to drinke wyth continuall desire of the fruitfull spring, euen vntyll the water of lyfe do flow vp in our hartes vnto euerlastyng gladnes, &amp; the day starre do arise in our hartes, which may lighten our mindes in to the knowledge of the God of glory.</p>
   <p>There is nothyng remayning more why this labour should be misliked, except anye man would thinke, that euery Congregation had a sufficient Pastor to instruct those that were ignorant, so that they should not néede any straunge Teacher: God graunt that in time to come this maye be found true. But yet we are farre from it, euen as light from darknes, or death from life, or as knowledge and vnderstanding is from insensible blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. O that we had eyes to see so great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: For sure it may not wel be iustified, that in so cleare light of the woorde, as God hath made now to shine vpon vs, that there was euer nation which had so ignorant Ministers We maye here in compare with the man of
<pb facs="6"/>
synne him selfe. I do not knowe that in the midst of all hys abominations there was a more lothsome sight of that idolatrous priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, then we haue set vp among our selues, to be fellow labourers among vs in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For what though they excéeded in loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life? Yet their darke and barbarous religion was so thicke a cloude spread ouer their maners, that the fulnes of their lynnes was not easely seue: But we haue the light that hath made althinges manyfest, and the Sunne hath shined that hath disclosed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so that there hath not bene among vs any popish Priest so dronken, nor any alehouse Chaplen at such a perpetuall truce with hys drinking pots, that hath possibly purchased so much discredite to his belly God, and kitchin faith, as our dum Dogs and guides, do dayly multiply against the God of Israel, and the faith of his anointed our onely God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. It gréeneth me to remember, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth me much more to rehearse the estate of the ministration into whych we are fallen. We haue good time now to complayne wyth the Prophet, like people, like Priest. Euen <note place="margin">Esa. 44. 2</note> the same coueringes of Israel that shadowed then their glory, they haue spread thē selues agayne as the heauens, &amp; are come ouer our head in so great a tempest of blindnes &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb facs="7"/>
that they haue shaken the foundations of all our comfort.</p>
   <p>We saw in deede <hi>Halcionios dies,</hi> the glad and pleasant daies in which our hope shined, when first our happy gouernment turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our sorrowes, brake the yoke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, deliuered vs from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and caryed vs among the Saints of God into the kingdome of light. But our hope hath since suffered a great Eclipse, from the fulnes of her beutie, (such hath bene the malice of Satan.) He attempted agaynst vs euen at the first his most pestilent practise, and hath brought accordinglye hys purpose to effect. When God had turned the wyl of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, <note place="margin">Deut. 1. 15</note> and enclined his eare to vnderstāding: when he had geuen vnto him courage to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Exo. 18. 21</note> the enemies of his truth, and planted true feare in his hart to establish his Gospel: then the subtile Serpent which had turned all his deuices hether, he bent his violence, and thys counsell pleased hym best: To corrupt the Priesthoode, who should instruct the Prince <note place="margin">Nu. 27. 21</note> by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> that if thus he might darken the light of the people, it might be the more easy to leade them out of the way.</p>
   <p>Then he entred againe, and with more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse into hys first assaultes, wherewyth he tempted once our sauiour Christ: He robbed
<pb facs="7"/>
the Minister of his blessed hope in the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and made him seeke the wayes ful of vile shame, to get his bread. He hanged before his eyes an other veale of pompe and vanitie, that he could not with open counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance see Christ, but folowed the present plea sures that better liked him. And so first woū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the head, the infection hath growen since into the other partes of the body, that now al most there is nothyng but woundes &amp; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and sores full of corruption. Looke wher we wyl among the people of the Lord, &amp; how hardly shall we funde the dwellyng place of the godly Pastour.</p>
   <p>If <hi>Ieremie</hi> were now aliue, he would take <note place="margin">Iere. 9. 1.</note> vp againe his old complaintes: <hi>O that myne head werefull of water, and mine eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the slayne of the daughter of my people.</hi> For looke what agrement hath righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes with vnrighteousnes, and what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship hath light with darknes, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord Christ with <hi>Belial,</hi> or what part the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with the Infidel: the same societie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a great number of our English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Uicars, with the true Preachers &amp; Ministers of the Gospell. Your selues good Christian Readers make the comparison, and be your own Iudges, what cause we haue to
<pb facs="8"/>
complaine. The true Minister is the salt of the earth, to drye vp corrupt and noysome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13.</note> and to preserue the substance pure, that the world may be offered vp a swete sacrifice vnto God: But our Uicars and Curates, we haue some of them yet of the old morowmas Priestes, whose salt is vnsauerie with much popish leauen, that there is no taste in them of the Gospell of Christ. Most certaine it is, that the popish Priesthoode is no calling for a Minister of the Gospell: And therefore they that haue not openly forsaken that, and haue geuen a new promise vnto Christ, they may well haue the lyuing, but they cannot be the persons whom God hath called, nor yet the salt to season his elect and chosen.</p>
   <p>The true Minister is the light of the world, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14</note> which holdeth foorth the Gospell of Christ in his hand as a lanterne to lighten the steps of a great number, how to walke vnto Christ: but what daylight I beseche you, shineth in the Ministers of our making? They are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter séene in their seueral occupations, then in the knowledge of the word, which they should dispence vnto others. The true Minister is a fisher of men, by whom the parish is stirred vp to all loue, to God first, and then mutually one to another: but the Parsons nowe haue either nets so broken, or their baytes so yll,
<pb facs="8"/>
that we sée the effect is, no gatheryng toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a wofull dispersion both of Priest &amp; people. How many examples do we sée of a continual dissipation in sutes and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? the Parson against the Uicar, the Uicar against the Parson, the Parish against both, and one against another, and al for the belly. Among whō neither people, Parson, Curate, Uicar, one nor other hath anye care for the Gospel of Christ. As the Lord doth lyue, this is no other fishing, but to suffer that roaryng Lyon to catch al by his enchauntmentes, that he may haue large pasture in the Church of God. The true Minister is the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 22 Mat. 9. 38 Mat. 22. 3 Ma. 23. 34.</note> the woorkeman in the haruest: the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger that calleth vnto the Mariage: the Prophet that telleth the wyl of the Lord: the wyse man that teacheth to discerne betwene good and euyll: the Scribe that doth expound <note place="margin">Ma. 25. 16 Lu. 24. 48 1. Cor. 4. 1</note> the law: the Seruant that occupieth his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters talentes vnto gayne: the Wytnes that beareth testimony of Christ to all people: the <note place="margin">Mathew. 24. 45. Ro. 15. 16.</note> dispensers of the misteries of God: the Stew ard that geueth meate in due time, vnto the residue of the houshold: the Sacrificer of the Gospel of God, to make the oblation of hys flocke acceptable: the Minister by whom the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 5</note> people doo beleue: the Labourers of God to tyll hys husbandrye, and make vp his buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9</note>
      <pb facs="9"/>
the Shepheard to féede the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his blood. <note place="margin">Ac. 20. 28</note> But alas and wo for vs, if we can sée our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, what one of these excellent vertues shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in our Pastors? I speake the truth, and God in his good time wyll geue vs eyes to sée his iudgementes. Scarce one Parish of an hundred hath found such a Minister, or scarce two and thrée in a Shéere whom God hath so blessed. If <hi>S. Paule</hi> say true, or if the voyce of God be fearfull in our eares, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleue except we heare, and we cannot <note place="margin">Ro. 10. 14</note> heare wythout a Preacher: where is our glory that we are the people of the Lord? Or where is our reioycing that the Gospell is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs? Were it not that the woorkes of the Lord preached dayly vnto vs, and their voyce had come into our eares, as fully as to <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 5.</note> our forefathers, euen in the strongest of our people, it would make their faith to wauer.</p>
   <p>For about vs in our Countrie, wher dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that Minister, or where is his name, that shall strengthen the weake harted, and rayse them vp in hope? He must faith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> he must be apt to teache that is made Minister: but we haue made the old saying true, <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet</hi>
      <note place="margin">

He hath broken hys two staues of happy fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <note place="margin">Zech. ii. 13</note> both bewty and bandes, and geuen in stéede of them the instrumentes of a foolyshe Shepheard, and hath raysed vs vp Pastours which looke not for the thinges that are lost, nor seeke the tender Lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor féede that that standeth vp. <note place="margin">2. Chroni. 15. 3.</note> And therfore we may boldly say, God himself being our warrāt, that the Israel of the Lord is without his Pastour.</p>
   <p>But some perhaps wyll thincke this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to be gréeuous, God hath not delt thus with vs, but rather hath multiplied a great manye of learned and godly Ministers vnto vs, euen now in great aboundance, as in any age before vs: Most certainly true it is, that
<pb facs="10"/>
God hath raysed vp in our dayes men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler hope, full of excellent giftes, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in yong yeares hath shined farre aboue the gray heares of their forefathers. Would God we were halfe thankfull inough for so manyfolde blessinges. The ioy of the whole earth, and the gladnes of al the world, that is the blessed hope of the Gospel, it shineth not a litle, euen in their countenances The Lord encrease them a thousand thousand fold, and geue them double his spirit, that they may be greater then all their enemies, &amp; abyde faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euen vnto death: that through them the Prince may reioyce, the Magistrate maye be glad, their fellowes may be encouraged, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> peo ple may be taught, al may haue hope, syn may be abolished, Idolatrye rooted out, Antichrist ouerthrowen, Satan troden downe, Hel may be confoūded, the Gospel may encrease, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes maye shine, and God may haue the glory. This desire is the fruite of our lyse, and ther is not in the world a better portion: this we haue chosen, and in this we wil dwel, vntyl the fulnes of tyme, that we shall say in our course: <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace.</hi>

   <p>But we haue here not a litle feare, and we sée the stumbling blockes, that haue made our wayes daungerous. True it is many men

   <p>Satan hath so rent a sunder the glorye of our Ministerie, that fleshe and bloud is not halfe willing to beare the shame of the world that goeth after it. He hath spoyled it of the due reward: of al authoritie: of al obedience: loue, reuerence &amp; honor that man should gene vnto it. He hath layd vpon it much contempt, many reproches, great pouertie, intollerable bondage, so that though the calling be in deede the most precious inheritance vnder the sun, yet the glory is so darkned vnto mortal eyes,
<pb facs="11"/>
that al Nobility is quite fled from it, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen afraid to come vnto it, the riche man rather chuseth any other kinde of life, the men nest estate so hardly contented with it, that <hi>S.

But God shall once geue agayne vnto his Ministerie beuty, in stéede of ashes, and ritch apparel in stéede of sackcloth, when he shal turne againe the captiuitie of <hi>Syon,</hi> &amp; build vp the walles of the promised <hi>Ierusalē.</hi> In the meane season we wyll lyue in hope, and geue thankes vnto our God that hath brought vs hetherto. One other assault of Sathan hurteth as much as this: yea and so much the more, because it is couered with the cloke of benefite, &amp; sheweth vs a saluing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine against the former wound. For where as the Ministers liuing in most Churches is but smal, he hath found this remedy, that one man should haue many benefices: &amp; whereas the reproche is not litle, but euen the name is ful of disdain, as to be called maister Parson, Maister Uicar, Syr Iohn, a parish Priest. &amp;c. Agaynst this euyll he hath founde a remedye worse, and geuen liberty to al that wyll, to be <hi>Non residentes,</hi> to forsake their charge, to go where they wyl like masterles hounds, to fyl

the cōmon wealth with worse then any ydle or vagabond persons. Loe this is the vessel of poyson that Satan hath set a broch, &amp; the cup of whoordome which the Pope hath begun of vnto al the world. This is the head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all spirituall darknes: the roote from which the glory of Antichrist dyd first aryse: the filthy spring of al abominations, which by pestilēt encrease hath ouerslowed kingdomes with most shameful slauery: brought Princes into contempt: &amp; set a vile person in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the world. And yet at thys day it doth so dull the spirites of many excellent mē, that their hartes are full of surfeting, and yet they foole not their disease, they wallow (as I said) in their own vomit, and yet they see not their shame. The hainousnes of this syune it is so displeasant in the sight of God, that he hath reuenged it w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> one of his greatest plages in hardening the offenders hartes, that they should haue eyes to sée, &amp; not sée, and eares to heare, &amp; not heare, and hartes to vnderstand, and yet not vnderstand. For wher as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges they heare the voyce of God, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low humbly his calling, yet here they be deafe euen as the Serpent that stoppeth his eares, that he may not heare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Charmer, charme he neuer so wisely.

      <hi>vnto your selues, &amp; to all the flock, of which the holy Ghost hath made you ouersears, to feede the Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased wich his own bloud.</hi> Oh that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept were written in our harts with an yron pen, or a claw of Adamant, that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget it. The often remēbrance that we haue bound our fayth vnto the spirit of God, that hee hath called vs for the instruction of his people, and that they are the price of the blood of Christ, would make vs at the last so to loue our duty, that the Sunne and Moone should be ashamed at the sound of a <hi>Nonresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> &amp; the name of that parson should be odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto vs, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> would take vpon him a charge and looke not after it. The Prophet saith, that <note place="margin">Ezec. 3. 18 &amp;. 33. 8.</note> if the Minister declare not the iudgements of
<pb facs="12"/>
God against hym that synneth, the wycked man shal dye in hys syn, but his blood shall be required at the hands of the negligent watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the faithful Minister, sayth that they <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17</note> watch ouer the soules of those that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, as they that shall geue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt if any of them perish. If these two be sufficiēt witnes, that according to the law the truth should be estéemed, by their woord most certain it is that our negligent Pastors, who haue couered them selues as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth, with thicke clay, and multiplyed their benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, tyll they be many in number, they must needes thinke they haue an heauy accompt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of Christ. Neither gold nor sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, nor the pride of honor shall be acceptable in stéede of the soules of their brethren. But so it is they are shut vp in blindnes, and God hath couered them with a spirit of slomber, &amp; they are set down in the counsels of the moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers &amp; despisers, which say in much securitye, where is the promise of his cōming?
