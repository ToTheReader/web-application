                 <title>The perpetuitie of a regenerate mans estate : VVherein it is manifestly proued by sundry arguments, reasons and authorities. That such as are once truly regenerated and ingrafted into Christ by a liuely faith, can neither finally nor totally fall from grace. It is also proued, that this hath beene the receiued and resolued doctrine, of all the ancient fathers, of all the Protestant churches and writers beyond the seas, and of the Church of England. All the principall arguments that are, or may be obiected against it, either from Scripture, or from reason, are here likewise cleared and answered. By William Prynne Gent: Lincolniensis</title>

   <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD GEORGE BY THE Diuine Prouidence Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and one of his Maiesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priuy Councell</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Reuerend <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> it hath pleased the dispenser and giuer of all honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of his especiall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to aduance your <hi>Grace</hi> (next to our gratious and Dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne) to the highest place of rule and dignitie in this our <hi>Church,</hi> whereby you are farre ingaged to patronize the truth of God, and the established and resolued Doctrines of our <hi>English Church.</hi> Which when I had well considered, it moued me to consecrate these <hi>first fruites</hi> of my studies to your <hi>Grace;</hi> which are nothing else, but a iust, (though weake and meane,) defence of a principell and ground of that religion, which hath beene long established and setled in our Church, till some factious and nouellizing spirits (if not worse) were so bold and impudent of late for to disturbe it. The men and meanes by which this truth hath beene
<pb facs="3"/>
disturbed and drawne into question, are not vnknowne (I suppose) vnto your <hi>Grace:</hi> and therefore I neede not to informe against them. All that I shall say of them is only this; that they are now so potent and so poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, that if they are not speedily and carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by your <hi>Grace,</hi> they are like to quell, at least to cloud, that glorious truth and Gospell (which hath shined so bright, so plentifully and comfortablie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs for so long a season,) with the dismall, the dangerous and pernitious mists of <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme.</hi> Their bookes, you know, which are fraught with dangerous and hurtfull <hi>errors</hi> (and so much the more dangerous, because they are sweetned, cloathed and guilded ouer, with the name and countenance of the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England</hi>) are printed and reprinted, sold openly and dispersed publikely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controll: and the pious, wholsome and Christian labours of all such as would confute them (by reason of those meanes which they haue made) can either finde no license for the presse: or if they chance to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the presse by stealth or otherwise, they are either quelled and smothered in it before they come vnto their birth, or else they are called in and quelled, before they can bee published and dispersed, for to cleare and vindicate the truth: so that by the suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and propagating of the one, and the discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing and suppressing of the other, that truth of God which wee haue hitherto professed, is like to be betrayed. Shall these factious, scismaticall and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall spirits, bee so industrous to establish and to vent their <hi>Errors,</hi> and to quell the truth: and shall not wee be as diligent and couragious to defend it? shall they
<pb facs="3"/>
with all their might and maine plant <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme,</hi> nay <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> &amp; <hi>Atheismie</hi> in our Church, and shall wee sit still with foulded hands, with silent tongues, and stupified hearts, and not labour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. Alas where is our loue, where is our zeale to God and to his cause? where is our ancient courage for the truth, that wee are now so cold and frozen, that we are now so much ashamed of that glorious <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which hath flourished so long among vs, and hath made vs a mirror and a spectacle of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vnto all the world; that now wee dare not, or at least wee will not, defend and take its part; that we dare not to (<note n="a" place="margin">Iude 3.</note>) <hi>contend</hi> and struggle for it? but that we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it so willingly to bee surprised and betrayed, as if wee were more willing to be rid of it, then any longer to inioy it. Certainly this want of courage for, and loue vnto the truth, as it is a sure syntome, (<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 24. 12.</note>) <hi>that iniquitie doth abound among vs,</hi> so it may iustly cause the Lord to bring a <hi>famine</hi> and scarcitie among vs, (<note n="c" place="margin">Amos 8. 11.</note>) <hi>not of bread</hi> only (which now is very likely to befall vs) but euen <hi>of the word of God,</hi> which is farre worse: yea, it may prouoke him, and that deseruedly, (<note n="d" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note>) <hi>to giue vs vp to strong delusions to beleeue lies, that we all may be damned, because wee would not receiue the loue of the truth, that so wee might be saued.</hi> O therefore let mee now beseech your <hi>Grace,</hi> that as in former times you haue, so now, you would take heart and courage for the truth. You haue many incouragements, many inforcements and ingagements for to doe it. For your incouragement, you haue the <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> and the almightie King of heauen for to take your part; you haue the votes and prayers of all true hearted Christians, you haue all the
<pb facs="4"/>
aide and assistance that heauen and earth can yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: O <hi>feare not then the</hi> (<note n="e" place="margin">Isay 2. 22.</note>) <hi>face</hi> or frowne <hi>of man whose breath is in his nostrells;</hi> feare not the power or the malice of any that oppose the truth, <hi>for wherin are they to be accounted of?</hi> the (<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 46. 7. 11.</note>) <hi>Lord of hosts is with you, the God of Iacob is your refuge,</hi> man therefore cannot stand before you. For inforcements and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be zealous and couragious for the truth, you haue very many. You are called to defend and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the truth: the very nature and qualitie of your function, and the very dignitie of that place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which now you doe sustaine, doe euen ingage and binde your <hi>Grace</hi> to be couragious and zealous for it. God hath committed his truth &amp; <hi>Gospell</hi> to your trust, and hath giuen it you in charge to propagate and defend it: God and our Gratious Soueraigne, haue committed the care and custodie of this our <hi>Church</hi> to your charge, and they haue giuen you more ability and power, (and so more cause) for to defend the truth and doctrine that is established and setled in it, then to other men: and therefore they will require and expect from your <hi>Grace,</hi> (<hi>to whom so much is committed</hi>) much more then they can, or will from any other. O therefore as you tender the glory and honour of the <hi>God</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the defence of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his cause and <hi>Gospell:</hi> the peace and safetie of this our <hi>Church,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your charge: as you tender your owne honor and reputation with God &amp; man, or that great account which you must shortly make to God, of that great stewardship of his which is committed to you: if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Suffer not his word and truth to bee betrayed and suppressed, by scismaticall, factious, and <hi>Antechristian</hi> spirits, for want of suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and defence: but since the eyes of God and man are cast vpon you, execute, stirre vp and act that place and power, which God and man haue giuen to you, to the quelling of heresy and scisme, to the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Arminianisme:</hi> (which are now flowing in so fast vpon vs, that they doe euen threaten a sodaine inundation and deluge to vs) to the subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the kingdome of <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antechris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Let not feare and cowardice, let not flesh and blood, or any other impediment whatsoeuer, daunt your courage, or coole your loue and zeale to <hi>Christ,</hi> or to his cause; but be willing to denie your selfe, to part with all for him, who hath euen denied himselfe, and parted with his life and all for you. And here I would intreate your <hi>Grace</hi> to pardon this my boldnesse and my rudenesse with you; (which though modesty and manners might ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

with the necessity and extremitie of the times, hath made me guilty of it (I hope not faulty in it) and withall I humblie consecrate these <hi>Firstlings</hi> of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (being nothing else but a iust defence of a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Orthodox point of faith, which hath long beene setled and established in this our Church, and in all reformed Churches beyond the seas) which if your <hi>Grace</hi> will but vouchsafe to Patronize and shelter, they shall not feele, they will not feare, a <hi>totall</hi> or a <hi>finall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

   <p>Now the <hi>God</hi> of all <hi>Grace,</hi> so beautifie and adorne your <hi>Grace</hi> with all the graces of his Spirit, so fill and replenish you with zeale, with fortitude and courage for the truth: and so firmely settle and establish you in the glorious and happy estate of true and sauing grace, that neither your <hi>Grace,</hi> (nor yet that truth and <hi>Gospell</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
