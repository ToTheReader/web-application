   <head>THE
TRANSLATORS
INTENT.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He motiue of my transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is partly to delite the
Rieder with the Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
o'the discourse, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to acquainte him wi' the
notorius difference which
in it appieres betwixt the doctrine, spirit,
&amp; style o'those Primitiue ages (in part of
which Saint <hi>Austin</hi> flourished) &amp; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
spirit, &amp; style o' the pretensiue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of our present tymes, concerning
some points of Religion in controuersie
betwixt them, &amp; vs Roman Catholiques,
which the tenor o' the Tractate will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
declare, &amp; specifie; especially tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Purgatorie, &amp; prayer to Saints;
which place of Purgatorie, Saint <hi>Austines</hi>
doctrines (professedly asserting in seueral
parts o'this his briefe <hi>elucubration,</hi> prayer
for Soules departed in state of saluation)
so necessarily supposes, that I must occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
<pb n="6" facs="3"/>
exhorte the erroneous perusers for
their own soules safetie touching this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
to adhere to antiquitie, &amp; renounce
noueltie, seriously yet farther reflecting
on that which the same S. <hi>Austin</hi> (applying
a certaine passage o'the Apostle to this same
purpose) in another place deliuers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the paines of Purgatorie:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 15. in Psal. 37.</note> sufficient to
cause al its contemners to tremble. <hi>Bicause</hi>
(quoth S. Austin) <hi>it is said, he shall be saued
as it were by fyer, that fyer is contemned: ey
plainely althou' they be saued by fyer, yet that
fyer, is more grieuous than al that one can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in this life.</hi> For which cause the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Father immediately afore in the
same place, &amp; occasion, most ingeniously, &amp;
iudiciously termes the paines of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<hi>an emendatorie fyer,</hi> ernestly desiring
God <hi>to purge him in this life, &amp; render him
such a one that now he stands not niede of it.</hi> In
so much that by thiese passages, &amp; by this
present Treatise it will finally appiere that
they who refuse to pray for Soules in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,<note place="margin">Iohn. Calu. Instit. lib. 4. cap. 14, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e,</note>
ar no such Christians as ancient
<hi>S. Austin,</hi> &amp; others o'former ages: this Father
being (euen as <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe confesses)
the best &amp; most fidelious witnesse of all the
aneient writers.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="7" facs="3"/>
But let this suffice briefely to infinuate
both the scope o'this matter, &amp; the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
purpose; in which if perchance the
viewer findes not the claritie which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
let him please not to attribute it to
the Interpreters defect, but to the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
o' the Authors style; whoe (supposing
the translator in realitie has vsed no smale
industrie in elucidating the sence) partly by
reason of his owne most in genious profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
&amp; partly by the Printers neglect, not
only in this but in the rest of his wourkes,
has diuers verie obscure &amp; intricate passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Nether let anie one maruelle at anie
noueltie appiering ether in the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
orthographie, or phrase, supposing he
most commonly both writes his wourds
according to their sounde in pronuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
&amp; som'at latinyzes &amp; frenchifyes his
style in this &amp; other his translations, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to mitigate the asperitie, or ruff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our vulgar tungue, &amp; the more
to facilitate it for those strangers who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
to lerne it, &amp; peruse our wrytings; &amp;
yet rather chuseing to streine the property
of his owne natiue language than in anie
sorte to diminishe the energie ether o'the
Authors style, or sence: but let him totally
<pb n="8" facs="4"/>
applie his mynde to the scope &amp; matter, of
this most famous Father: for in this dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we wil haue bothe pleasure, &amp; profit,</p>
   <p>Finally the Translator in most humble
manner presentes his labor as a perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
DEDICATORIE of his religious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; respect to the excellent Princesse, &amp;
gratious great Ladie, the Ladie Duches of
Richmond, expecting no other reward
for his seruice, than that her excellēcie wil
at her conuenient leisure &amp; retired tymes,
gratiously voutsafe to peruse this briefe
treatise o' the antient &amp; renowned Father
Saint <hi>Austin;</hi> &amp; seriously reflecte how
much she is traduced by her Preichers, &amp;
Directors concerning the doctrine of
prayer for soules departed, Masse, merit,
&amp; Mediation of Saints; for thence dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
her Grace by diuyne grace, &amp; assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
will yet further conceue, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that, in sembleable sorte she is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the true dictamen of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
in other points of her faith, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
vnder a false pretext of Scripture,
&amp; the written Wourd of God: as by
diuyne assistance I intend professedly to
demonstrate in an other occasion.</p>
