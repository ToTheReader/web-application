      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter <hi>Solon</hi> (right Worshipfull yong men) had seene <hi>Thespis</hi> his first edition and action of a Tragoedie, and meeting vvith him before the playe, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, If he vvere not ashamed to publish such feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fables under so noble, yet a counterfeit perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: <hi>Thespis</hi> answered, That it vvas no disgrace upon a stage (merrily and in sport) to say and do any thing. Then <hi>Solon</hi> (striking hard upon the earth vvith his staffe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thus: Yea but shortly, vve that now like and embrace this play, shall finde it practised in our contracts and common affaires. This man of deepe understanding, saw that publicke discipline and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of manners affected and attempted once in sport and ieast, vvould soone quaile: &amp; corruption, at the beginning passing in play, vvould fall and end in earnest. Therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> vvorthily dooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the manners of the Germanes of his time, amongst vvhom, vices were not laughed at. For laughters begun of some publick shame and dishonestie, wil assuredly procure him some miserable calamitie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of France is unto all ages and nations a vvofull view, yet a profitable instruction at this day. For vvhē the cleare light of the Gospell began first to spring and appeare, Sathan (to occupie and busie mens minds vvith toyish playes and trifles, that they might give no attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to true vvisedome) devised this policie, to raise up jeasters and fooles in Courts, vvhich creeping in, by quipping and prettie conceits, first in vvords, and after by bookes, uttering their pleasant ieasts in the Courts and banquets of kings and princes, laboured to root up all the true principles of Religion and Policie. And some there vvere vvhom the resemblance of nature, or vanitie of wit had so deceived, that they
<pb facs="3"/>
derided the everlasting veritie of the true God, as if it were but a fable. <hi>Rabelaysus</hi> amongst the French, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> amongst the Germanes, were the standerd bearers of that traine<hi>:</hi> which with their skoffing taunts, inveighed not only against the Gospell, but all good arts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. Those mockers did not as yet openly undermine the ground work of humane societie, but only they derided it: But such Cyclopian laughters, in the end prooved to be onely signes and tokens of future evils. For by little and little, that which was taken in the beginning for iestes, turned to earnest, &amp; words into deedes. In the necke of these came new Poets, very eloquent for their owne profit, which incensed unto lust &amp; lightnesse, such mindes as were alreadie inclined to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, by quickening their appetites with the delectable sause of unchast hearing; and pricking them forward with the sharp spurres of pleasure. Who could then bridle vices and iniquities, vvhich are fed with much wealth, and no lesse libertie? seeing them not onely in play, mirth, and laughter entertained; but also earnestly accepted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as being very excellent. Yet some troad the steps of honesty, which now lay a dying, and practised the ould manners and fashions, which were almost forgotten. For although the secret faults of the Court were evill spoken of, yet shame stoode in open view; hainous &amp; infamous crimes kept secret corners; princes were of some credit and faith; lawes were in reasonable good use; magistrates had their due au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and reverence; all things onely for ostentation and outward shew, but none would then have feared an utter destruction: For than Sathan being a disguised person amongst the French, in the likenesse of a merry ieaster, acted a Comaedie, but shortly ensued a wofull Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedie. When our countrie mens minds were sick, and corrupted with these pestilent diseases, and that discipline vvaxed stale; then came forth the books of <hi>Machiavell,</hi> a most pernitious vvriter, vvhich began not in secret and stealing manner (as did those former vices) but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen meanes, and as it vvere a continuall assault, utterly destroyed, not this or that vertue, but even all vertues at once: Insomuch as it tooke Faith from the princes; authoritie and maiestie, from lavves; libertie from the people; and peace and concord from all persons, vvhich are the onely remedies for present malladies. For vvhat shall I speake of Religion, vvhereof the Machiavellians had none, as already plainelie appeareth; yet they greatly laboured also, to deprive us of the same. And although they have vvrongfully bannished us our native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet fight vvee still for the Churches defence. Moreover Sathan
<pb facs="3"/>
useth strangers of France, as his fittest instruments, to infect us stil with this deadly poyson sent out of Italie, vvho have so highly promoted their Machivellian bookes, that he is of no reputation in the Court of France, vvhich hath not <hi>Machiavels</hi> vvritings at the fingers ends, and that both in the Italian and French tongues, &amp; can apply his precepts to all purposes, as the Oracles of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Truly it is a wonderfull thing to consider how fast that evill weede hath growne within these fewe yeares, seeing there is almost none that striveth to excell in vertue or knowledge: as though the onely way to obteine honour and riches were by this deceivers direction. But now to turne mine eyes from beholding so many miseries of poore afflicted France, as often as I see or remember our neighbour countries (which thing I doe daily) so often doe I bevvaile our miseries: Yet am I right ioyfull for your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; chiefely because God of his great bounty, hath given you a most renowned Queene, as well in deede, as title, even in the middest of so many troubles: For she comming to the crowne, even when England was tossed with tempestuous stormes, so dispersed those cloudes, with the brightnesse of her counsell and countenance, that no civile dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor externall invasion, hath disturbed your peace &amp; tranquilitie, these many yeeres, especially so many vvarres sounding on every side: For shee by maintaining vvholesome unitie amongst all degrees, hath hitherto preserved the State of her realme, not onely safe but florish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing▪ not by Machiavelian artes, as Guile, Perfidie, and other Villanies practising: but by true vertues, as Clemencie, Iustice, Faith. Therfore goeth she her progresse throgh her realme of England, entertained in all places with happy applause, reioysing, &amp; prosperitie of all her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, she being a princesse, of both Nobles and commons, by dew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert most entirely beloved: Whereas vve against our vvils, behold our countrie svvimming in blood, and disfigured by subversion, vvhich is a ioyfull obiect to the eyes of strangers, yea and those labour most to vvork her destruction, vvho should bee most carefull to rescue &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver poore France, out of her long calamities: but the Lord vvill at length behould our miseries. But O hovv happy are yee, both because you have so gratious a Queene, &amp; also for that the infectious Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velian doctrine, hath not breathed nor penetrated the intrails of most happy England. But that it might not so doe, I have done my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to provide an Antidote and present remedie, to expell the force of so deadly poyson, if at any time it chance to infect you. For vvhen I thought it meete and right (especially in such a confused disorder of
<pb facs="4"/>
matters and times) to impart as vvell to our Frenchmen, as to other nations these discourses, first vvritten by a man of most singular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vvisedome, I vvillingly undertooke this labour, vvhich I have performed to the uttermost of my povver, and novv I vvholy refer my selfe and my travaile, to serve for the benefit of publicke utilitie: Yet I properly dedicated and inscribed it in your names; both because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I never savv England, yet it might serve as a pledge, to testifie my thankfull minde tovvards your countrymen, vvhose singular cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie &amp; kindnesse shevved to my bretheren, vvhen they vvere banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the profession of the Gospell, hath generally bound mee to all Englishmen, but privately to you: as also that by vvay of exhortation, I might enflame you (being most vertuous Gentlemen) to study and follovv the contents of this booke, but especially the artes and vertues therein published, &amp; almost in every vvord therof so highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; vvhich indeede is no other thing, than you doe alreadie. For the beholding of your ancestors monuments of their vertues (vvhich are both many and famous) doth move you thereunto, more than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections drawne from all ages and examples here delivered. Therfore my deare friend <hi>Francis,</hi> amongst so many notable examples of your realme, treade the steps of your unckle, the right honourable earle of Huntington, a man most admirable and ilustrious, as well for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and other noble vertues, as for noble parentage &amp; honour, rhat you mayshew your selfe vvorthie of your place and kindred. And you good <hi>Edward,</hi> imitate the vvisedome, sanctimonie, and integritie of your Father, the right Honourable Lord <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> keeper of broade Seale of England, a man right renowned; that you may lively expresse the image of your Fathers vertues, in the excellent tovvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vvhich you naturally have from your most vertuous Father: If you both, do daily ruminate and remember the familiar &amp; best known examples of your ancestors, you cannot have more forcible persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to moove you to that which is good and honest: But I vvill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pray God to prosper that good hope, vvhich your parents and kinsfolkes have of you, your good studies also, and that he vvill plentifully blesse and beautifie you, with all the gifts of his spirit, that you may become profitable members of the Church, your countrie, and commonweale, and may live long and happie daies.</p>
