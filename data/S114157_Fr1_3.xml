   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER. IN VVHICH are laid open some few examples of the singular Ignorance, Lying, and other bad dealings of <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> in his Answere to the <hi>Censure</hi> of the Apology.</head>
   <p>THREE thinges (gentle Reader) at the comming forth of this Booke may occur vnto thy mynd, in which thou mayst perhaps desire some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. First the cause why so idle a worke as <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> Answere is knowne, and taken to be, should be answered at all by so graue and learned a man as <hi>F. Persons</hi> was. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly why this Answere is published so late after his death. And last of all what opinion is to be had of <hi>M.
<pb facs="6"/>
Barlowes</hi> talents, learnin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, &amp; methode in answering, or what others heere do iudge of the same.<note place="margin">Three things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> And albeit this latter may seeme to some to be of least moment for that one aduersary most commonly will hold an others writing in highest contempt, and therfore from them so much interessed, no sound iudgement may be expected: yet do I thinke it very necessary to insist most thereon, or rather am forced to the same, for that <hi>M. Barlow</hi> is so desirous of honour, as like the Ape he thinketh his owne whelp fayrest: and himselfe will needs perswade his Maiesty that he hath so answered, as that no sound Reply can euer be made thereunto. Wherfore as well for thy instruction (good Reader) as also to rectify <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> iudgement, which in this seemeth to be very erroneous, and to teach him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>cience better before he presume againe so far, as eyther to promise to a Prince, or put forth in print; I shall set downe my opinion, &amp; worth of his Booke, and that vpon no other grounds, then I shall produce out of the Booke it selfe, whereby thou shalt haue more light to discerne in this affaire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, and <hi>M. Barlow</hi> lesse cause to complaine of any hard measure, seeing that against <hi>M. Barlow</hi> non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> is brought to plead, but <hi>M. Barlow</hi> himselfe.</p>
   <p n="2">2. To the first point then, this briefly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that <hi>F. Persons</hi> hauing seene the base manner &amp; method of writing which <hi>M. Barlow</hi> houldeth through his whole Booke,<note place="margin">Why M. <hi>Barlowes</hi> book was answered by F. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
      </note> esteemed the worke not worthy of any answere, and so resolued with himselfe to be silent therein, and in lieu of refuting this answere to set forth the other two parts of Resolution, so long before promised by him, and so much desired of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks in England: which whiles he went about to doe,
<pb facs="6"/>
a Copy of this answere of <hi>M. Barlow</hi> came to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors hands, and was by them sent to the said Father with order to refute the same, perswading themselues that a booke of that bulke &amp; argument, written by a pretēded Prelate, &amp; dedicated to his Maiesty, could not but beare some shew of learning, and therfore was, not to be left vnanswered. And that good opinion got <hi>M. Barlow</hi> by writing in English: for could these haue but vnderstood what was written, &amp; with what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and learning, he may be sure <hi>F. Persons</hi> should neuer haue bene troubled with the sight therof, but a shorter course had byn taken by casting it into the fire, the fittest element to purge such vnsauoury filth, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where he belcheth forth in the same against all sortes of men, wherof you shall hardly fynd any one page to be void.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Now, for the stay which hath bene made in the setting forth of this worke,<note place="margin">The cause of the stay of this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> seeing that the said Father dispatched what he wrote in lesse then 4. mōths it being now more then 4. tymes as much since his de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cease, hath especially proceeded vpon the manifold other incumbrances &amp; variable disposition of body, wherwith that party hath bene troubled to whome the worke was committed to be finished, as himselfe cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth in the very entrance of the first Chapter of his Supplement, which he intended to haue set forth with this Booke: but growing to so great a bulke by reason of the manifold aduantages giuen by the Aduersary, it was thought better in the end, that it should goe forth a part, as making of it selfe a iust volume with some little enlargement, or addition annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in answere of some things obiected, forged not well vnderstood, or misalleadged by <hi>M. Doctour
<pb facs="7"/>
Andrews,</hi> now of <hi>Ely,</hi> concerning the matters by him handled in the <hi>Supplement,</hi> whome togeather with <hi>M. Barlow</hi> he answereth with that grauity, iudgement, and learning, as will content all, yea euen his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes themselues (if by these meanes they were to be contented:) or if that the search of truth were the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their motion, and chiefe end of their endeauors; and not contrarily with neglect &amp; contempt therof, to speake <hi>placentia,</hi> and write that which may pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> their humors best, by whome they hope to gaine most, not regarding on which side equity and right doth stand, so they withstand not them, whose pleasure they make the square of their actions, &amp; whose fauour they hold for their highest felicity.</p>
   <p n="4">4. But touching the last point, for that I meane to make it the subiect of this Preface, I shall be more long, not for any difficulty which I fynd in the thing it selfe (for who but <hi>M. Barlow</hi> knoweth not what a weake write<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And commonly none brag more then those who performe least, or vpon other occasion, then when they are most vanquished and ouercome: at least so it fareth often with <hi>M. Barlow</hi> who thus vaunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telleth his Maiesty, that he is one of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and a continuall succession, which are ready for

The other example of his Grammaticall construction is concerning a place of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> about the authority of Kinges, where the Cardinal refelling an obiection that the exemption of Clergy-men from tributes, and appearing at secular tribunalls, is <hi>de iure humano,</hi> and so may be repealed by Princes, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it doth not follow,<note place="margin">

And what can be required more to the vnity of names? Or can <hi>M. Barlow</hi> conceaue that they haue one name without all vnity?

   <p n="21">21. Touching the last point which remayned to be treated, of <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> ignorance in matters of

diuinity, for that it is his chief profession, I shall more inlarge my self therein,<note place="margin">M.

   <p n="22">22. First then he must know, that eyther <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> choice was so bad, or iudgement so small, that he neuer almost cyteth the <hi>Maister of Sentences, S.

<pb facs="15"/>
no mention of <hi>vnlawfull things</hi> commaunded, but of <hi>vniust,</hi> for a King may commaund things that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust; as that his subiects giue him all the money or goodes they haue; whereto for feare of daunger they may yield, which they could not doe, were the thing of it owne nature vnlawfull: which is <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his expresse doctrine in the next precedent article: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there here (<hi>must notwithstanding obey</hi>) but the contrary, that absolutely <hi>they are not bound to obey,</hi> vnles perhaps it be for some other cause, as of scā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall or daunger: in which cases they may, to saue their liues, or for auoyding the hurt and offence of others, doe those thinges which are vniustly commaunded thē, so they be not of their owne nature <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> but only in respect of the Cōmaunder, who eyther cōtrary to iustice, or by vsurped authority doth cōmaund thē.</p>

Are they not still in the same degree of difference and oppositiō as before? Doe they not still deny our Sauiours descent into hell? Do they not disclay me from the English Hierarchie? Will they acknowledge the Kings Supreme authority in causes Ecclesiasticall, as King <hi>Henry</hi> did challenge it? Or will they recall what they haue written of their discipline, that it is an essentiall marke of the Church, without which there were no Church, no Faith, no Ghospell, and consequently the Protestants to be no Ghospellers, to be out of the Church, out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the faithfull?</p>
