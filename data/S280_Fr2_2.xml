   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, having already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thee with many good Lessons, and morall Instruction of <hi>Cato,</hi> which daily and hourely he taught unto his young sonne: I likewise have thought fit, to present unto thy view three precepts more, which he left unto him upon his death-bed, to be observed and kept above all other Precepts and Commaudements formerly left him in writing, which rust had almost consumed, and time buried in oblivion, had I not by chancc lighted upon them, in an old Antiquaries library, and put upon their backes new liveries, their old ones being quite out of fashion, and therefore altogether out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest with those which otherwise might be their soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, and fellow-companions, being almost an hundred thirty yeers since they were last printed, and translated out of Dutch into our mother tongue. Wherefore having taken such paines in the metamorphosing of them to the same habite or stile of the rest of his
<pb facs="45"/>
most worthy Precepts, I trust they will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome unto thee, being no lesse worthy of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation than the former: for as my Authour wished good in translating them into English prose, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doe I in metamorphosing them into English metre, following my copy in the phrase of our speech, without adding or diminishing, either in substance or circumstance, as neere as possibly I could. If any then be so curious, as to distaste these my poore indeavours, for the plainnesse of the verse, or the dislike of the Authour, being a heathen, Ile make no other apologie for my selfe and him, but this: For the first, it is the height of my ambition to adorne every action with the most plainest proper object, especially where I have a patterne laid before me for my imitation; as for the latter, it is no shame for us to learne wit of Heathens, neither is it materiall in whose schoole wee take out a good lesson. Howsoever therefore my unpolished worke shall be accepted at thy hands, yet shall I not have cause to repent me of my labonr, for the benefit that may come thereby, and so I conclude,</p>

      <signed>Yours assured, though there be no assurance amongst men. WALTER GOSNOLD.</signed>
