   <head>The Preface of Martine Luther vpon the Epistle to the Galathians.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> My selfe can scarcely beleeue that I was so plentifull in wordes when I did publikely expounde this Epistle of <hi>S. Paule</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> as this booke sheweth me to haue bene. Notwithstanding, I perceaue all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations which I finde in this treatise by so great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the brethren gathered together, to be mine: so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I must needes confesse either all, or perhaps more, to haue bene vttered by me in this publike treatise. For in my heart this one article raigneth, euen the faith of Christ. From whom, by whom, and vnto whom all my diuine studies day and night haue recourse to and froe continually. And yet I perceaue that I coulde not reache any thing neare vnto the heighte, bredth, and depth of suche highe and inestimable wisedome: onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bare and poore beginnings, &amp; as it were fragments doe appeare. Wherfore I am ashamed that my so barren and simple Commētaries should be set forthe vpon so worthy an Apostle, and elect vessel of God. But when I consider againe the infinite and horrible abuses and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which alwayes haue raged in the Churche of God, and yet at this day cease not to rage against this onely and grounded rocke, which we holde to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> article of our iustification, (that is to say, howe, not by our selues, neither by our workes, which are lesse then oure selues, but by an other helpe, euen the sonne of God Iesus Christ, we are redemed from sinne, death, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> deuell, and made partakers of eternal life) I am compelled to cast of all shame, &amp; to be bolde aboue measure.</p>
   <p>This rocke did Sathan shake in paradise,<note place="margin">Gen. 3, vers. 2.</note> when he perswaded our first parents, that by their owne wisedome and power they should be like vnto God: forsaking true Faith in God, who had geuen them life, and promised the continuaunce therof. By and by after, this lier and murtherer, which will be alwayes like vnto him selfe, stirred vp the brother to the murthering of his brother, and for none other cause,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> but for that his godly brother by Faith had offered vp a more excellent sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and he offering vp his owne works without faith, had not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God. After this, against the same Faith followed a most intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="9"/>
persecution of Sathan by the sonnes of <hi>Caine,</hi> vntil God was euen cōstrained at once by the floud to purge the whole world, and to defend <hi>Noe</hi> the preacher of righteousnesse.<note place="margin">Genes 6. 2. Peter. 2.5. Genes. 10.6. &amp;c.</note> This notwithstanding Sathan continued his seede in <hi>Cham,</hi> the third sonne of <hi>Noe.</hi> But who is able to recken vp all examples? After these things the whole world waxed madde against this Faithe,<note place="margin">1 Actes 14.</note> finding out an infinite nombre of idolles and straunge religions, wherby euery one (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayth) walked his owne way, trusting by their workes, some to pacifye or please a God, some a Goddesse, some Gods, some Goddesses: that is to say, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of Christ, by their owne workes to redeme them selues from euils and from their sinnes, as all the examples and monuments of all nations doe sufficiently witnesse.</p>
   <p>But these are nothing in comparison of that people and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, Israell: which not onely had the sure promise of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fathers, and afterward the lawe of God, geuen vnto them from God him selfe by his angels,<note place="margin">Actes. 7.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> aboue all other: but alwayes and in all things were also certified by the present sayings, miracles, and examples of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> prophets. Notwithstanding euen amonge them also Satan did so preuaile (that is to say, the madde &amp; outragious opinion of their owne righteousnes) that afterwardes they killed all the prophets, yea euen Christ him self the sonne of God, their promised Messias, for that they had taught, that men are accepted into the fauour of God by grace only and not by their owne righteousnes. And this is the summe of the doctrine of the deuill and of the world from the beginning: We will not seeme to doe, euill, but yet whatsoeuer we doe that must God allow of, &amp; all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets must consent to it, which if they shall refuse to doe, they shall dye the death. <hi>Abell</hi> shall dye, but <hi>Cain</hi> shall florishe. Let this be our lawe (say they) and euen so it commeth to passe.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The church of the Gentiles.</note>But in the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the matter is, and hath beene so vehemētly handled, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the fury of the Iewish Sinagoge may wel seeme to be but a sport.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.1.</note> For they (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth) <hi>did not knovv Christ their anoynted,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note>
      <hi>&amp; therfore they crucified the lord of glory.</hi> But the church of the gentiles hath receyued &amp; confessed Christ to be the sonne of god, being made our righteousnes, &amp; this doth she publikely record, reade, and teach. And yet notwithstanding this confession, they that would be accounted the church, do kill and persecute, &amp; continually rage against those which beleeue and teach and in their deedes declare nothing els, but that Christ is the selfe same thing that they them selues (though w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fayned wordes and hipocriticall deedes) are constrained mawgre their
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
heads, to allow and confesse. For vnder the name of Christ at this daye they reigne. And if they could without the name of Christ hold that seate and kingdome, no doubt but they would expresse him to be such a one openly as in their hartes they esteeme him secretly. But they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme him a great deale lesse then the Iewes doe, which at the least thinke him to be <hi>Thola,</hi> that is to say, a theefe worthely hanged on the crosse. But these men account him as a fable, and take him as a fayned God amongest the gentiles, as it may plainly appeare at Rome in the Popes court, and almost throughout all <hi>Italie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Because therefore Christ is made as it were a mocke amongest his Christians (for Christians they wilbe called): and for that <hi>Cain</hi> doth kill <hi>Abell</hi> continually,<note place="margin">The argument of iustificatiō, very necessary and diligently to be handled.</note> &amp; the abhomination of Sathan doth now chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raigne, it is very necessary that we should diligently handle this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and set it against Sathan, whether we be rude or eloquent, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or vnlearned. For this rocke must be published abrode, yea though euery man should holde his peace, yet euen of the very rockes &amp; stones them selues. Wherfore I doe most willingly heerein accomplish my duetie, and am contented to suffer this long Commentarie and full of wordes, to be set forth for the stirring vp of all the brethren in Christ, against the sleights and malice of Sathan, which in these dayes is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into suche extreame madnesse against this healthfull knowledge of Christ now reuealed and raised vp againe: that as hetherto men haue seemed to be possessed with deuels and starke madde, euen so nowe the deuils them selues doe seeme to be possessed of farre worse deuels, and to rage euen aboue the furie of deuils,<note place="margin">The rage of Sathan, a sure argumēt that the day of iudgemēt is at hande.</note> which is in deede a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that that enemie of truth and life, doth perceaue the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be at hand, which is the horrible day of his destruction, but the most comfortable day of our redemption, and shall be the end of all his tyrannie and crueltie. For not without cause is he disquieted, when his members and powers are so assailed: euen as a theefe or an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, when the morning appeareth and discloseth his wickednesse, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tardie and apprehended for the same. For who euer heard (to passe ouer the abhominations of the Pope) so many monsters to burst out at once into the world, as we see at this day in the Anabaptists alone?<note place="margin">The outrages of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tistes.</note> In whom Sathan breathing out as it were the last blast of his kingdom, through horrible vproures setteth them euery where in such a rage, as though he would by them sodenly, not only destroy the whole world with seditions, but also by innumerable sectes swallow vp and deuoure Christ wholy with his Church.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>Against the liues and opinions of others he dothe not so rage: to wit, against whoremōgers, theues, murtherers, periured persons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against God, vnbeleuers. No, to these rather he geueth peace and quietnesse: these he maintaineth in his court w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> all manner of pleasures and delites, and geueth to them all things at will: Euen like as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the beginning of the church, he did not onely suffer all the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and false religiōs of the whole world to be quiet and vntouched, but also mightely maintained,<note place="margin">The Deuill troubleth not those that are buried and dead in sinne, but especially those that are godly and hate sinne.</note> defended, and nourished the same. But the church &amp; religion of Christ alone he vexed on euery side. After this, permitting peace and quietnes to many heretikes, he troubled only the catholike doctrine. Euen so likewise at this day he hath no other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in hand but this onely (as his owne and alwaies proper vnto him selfe) to persecute and vexe our Sauiour Christ: which is our perfect righteousnes without our workes, as it is writen of him: <hi>Thou shalt treade vpon his heele.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Genes. 3, ver. 15.</note>
   </p>
   <p>But I doe not set forth these my meditations so much against these men, as for my brethren, which will either shew them selues thankfull in the Lord for this my trauell, or els will pardon my weakenes and temeritie. But of the wicked I would not in any wise they should be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or allowed: but rather that therby both they and their God might be the more vexed, seeing with my greate trauell they are sette forth onely for suche as <hi>S. Paule</hi> writeth this Epistle vnto: that is to say, the troubled,<note place="margin">For vvhose cause special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luther set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth this vvorke and vvho they be that onely vnderstand this doctrine.</note> afflicted, vexed, tempted, (for they onely vnderstande these thinges) and miserable <hi>Galathians</hi> in the Faithe. Who so are not such, let them heare the papistes, monkes, anabaptistes and such other maisters of profound wisdome and of their owne religion, and let them stoutly contemne our doctrine and our doinges. For at this day the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes and anabaptistes conspire together against the church in this one point (though they dissemble in wordes) that the worke of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the worthines of the person. For thus do the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes teach:<note place="margin">The dignitie of Gods vvord and the sacraments depend not vpon the vvorthines or vnvvorthines of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> that baptisme is nothing except the person doe beleeue. Out of this principle must needes follow, that all the workes of God be nothing if the man be nothing. But baptisme is the worke of God, and yet notw<seg rend="sup">t</seg>standing an euell man maketh it, not to be the worke of God. Moreouer, hereof it must follow that matrimonie, authoritie, libertie and bondage, are the workes of God: but because men are euill, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not the workes of God. Wicked men haue the sunne, the moone, the earth, the water, the aire, and all suche other creatures sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto them: but because they be wicked and not godly, therfore the
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
sunne is not the sunne, the moone, the earth, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> water, are not that which they are. The Anabaptistes them selues had bodies and soules before they were rebaptised: but because they were not godly, therefore they had not true bodies and true soules. Also their parentes were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully married (as they graunt them selues) because they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised: therefore the Anabaptistes them selues are all bastards, and their parentes were all adulterers and whoremongers, and yet they doe inherite their parents landes and goods, although they graunt thē selues to be bastardes and vnlawfull heires. Who seeth not here in the Anabaptistes, men not possessed with Deuills, but euen Deuills them selues possessed with worse Deuills?</p>
   <p>The Papistes in like manner vntill this daie doe stande vpon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and the worthines of man, contrary to grace, and so (in wordes at the least) doe strongly assist their brethren the Anabaptistes. For these Foxes are tied together by the tailes,<note place="margin">Iudges. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>5, 4.</note> although by their heades they seeme to be contrary. For outwardly they pretende to be their greate enemies, when as inwardly notwithstanding they thinke, teache and defend in deede all one thinge against our Sauiour Christ, who onely is our righteousnes. Let him therefore that can, holde fast this one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and let vs suffer the rest which haue made shipwracke thereof,<note place="margin">1.

         </gap>.</note> to be carried whether the sea and windes shall driue them, vntill either they returne to the ship or swimme to the shore.</p>
   <p>The conclusion and ende of this complaint is, to hope for no qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes or ende of complaint, so long as Christ and Belial doe not agree.<note place="margin">Eccles. 11, 4. Psal. 121.4.</note>
      <hi>One generation passeth and an other commeth.</hi> If one heresie die, by and by an other springeth vp: for the Deuill doth neither slumber nor sleepe.

But Satan the God of all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, stirreth vp daily new sectes, and last of all (which of all other,<note place="margin">Vnderstande this of pestilēt Libertines vvhich vvould vtterly take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the lavv, al feare of god and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of his vvord. <hi>Osea. 4, 4.

      </note> I should neuer haue foreseene or once suspected) he hath raised vp a secte of such as teach that the ten commaundementes ought to be taken out of the church, and that men should not be terrefied with the lawe, but gentely exhorted by the preaching of the grace of Christ, that the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet <hi>Micheas</hi> might he fulfilled: <hi>Let none rebuke or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue an other: They shall not prophecie vnto them.</hi> As though we were ignorant or had neuer taught that afflicted and broken spirites
<pb facs="11"/>
must be comforted by Christ: but the hard harted Pharises vnto whom the grace of God is preached in vaine, must be terrified by the lawe. And they them selues also are forced to deuise &amp; imagine certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of Gods wrath against the wicked &amp; vnbeleuers. As though the lawe were or could be any thing els, but a reueiling of Gods wrath against impietie. Such is the blindnes and pride of these men: which euen by their owne iudgement doe condemne them selues. Wherefore it behoueth the ministers of Gods word to be surely perswaded (if they will be accounted faithfull and wise in the day of Christ) that the word of <hi>S. Paule</hi> is not spoken in vaine,<note place="margin">An exhortatiō to ministers.</note> or prophecied of a matter of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11, 19.</note> to witte, <hi>that there must be heresies, that they vvhich are proued may be knovvne.</hi> Yea I say, let the minister of Christ knowe, that so long as he teacheth Christ purely, there shall not be wanting peruerse spirites, yea euen of our owne and among our selues, which shall seeke by all meanes possible, to trouble the church of Christ. And herewithal let him comfort him selfe, that there is <hi>no peace betvvene Christ and Beliall,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6, 15. Genes. 3, 5.</note>
      <hi>or betvvene the seede of the serpent, and the seede of the vvoman.</hi> Yea let him reioice in the troubles which he suffereth by these sectes and seditious spirites, continually springing vp one after an other. For this is our reioicing, <hi>euen the testimony of our conscience,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.12.</note> that we be found standing and fighting in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the seede of the woman, against the seede of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Let him bite vs by the heele and spare not. We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine will not cease to crush his heade, by the grace and help of Christ the principall bruser ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who is blessed for euer.</p>
