      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Did expect (Courteous Reader) that before I had written any word in these matters, both my <hi>first Booke,</hi> and my <hi>second</hi> also (which is my <hi>Reply</hi>) should first have beene answered, and that in such sort as in the <hi>Postscript</hi> annexed at the end of the same my <hi>Reply</hi> is declared: but therein I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mine expectation is deceaved, and that my <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie</hi> without any regard had to that which I desired, hath taken his owne course, and put forth a <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to that my <hi>Reply.</hi> In which his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> I am sorry to see how much he, debating the point of <hi>Supremacie</hi> wrongeth not onely <hi>Me,</hi> and his <hi>Reader,</hi> and the auncient Christian <hi>Emperours</hi> and auncient <hi>Fathers,</hi> but even <hi>CHRIST IESVS</hi> also himselfe, and all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> generally in respect of their severall rights to them belonging. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought it not meete or seemely, for me in this case to be silent, or to desist, but, (being thus provoked) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and to make and publish a <hi>Surreplication</hi> to that <hi>Rejoynder.</hi> And this I doe the rather, that so a <hi>third book</hi> being added to my <hi>two former,</hi> they all three together might serve so much the more strongly to perswade him, and the rest of the pretended <hi>Catholickes</hi> to the truth in this cause for <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> &amp; a threefold corde is not easily broken. If by all or any of my labours, I shall bee a meane or helpe to worke their conformitie or reformation I shall be glad of it, for it is the maine thing I seeke after:
<pb facs="3"/> but if they hate to be reformed and will in contempt and scorne of all admonitions live &amp; die in their errors (which were a case most fearefull, desperate, and lamentable,) whom can they blame therein but themselves, and their Popish teachers, by whom they are so much misled and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. My <hi>Adversarie</hi> when he tooke upon him to answer the two Chapters in my first Booke did not prefixe those two Chapters of mine to his answer: neyther when hee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my <hi>Reply</hi> did he prefixe my <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>Rejoynder:</hi> And therefore also, neyther did I prefixe his answere to my <hi>Reply,</hi> nor his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to this my <hi>Surreplication.</hi> Whereat, neyther he, nor any other for him hath cause to be offended, or to take exception, in asmuch as I doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but follow his owne president and example, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe first used, and wherein hee began unto mee. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, neverthelesse, marrow, pith, and strength of all his Bookes, and of his reasons and arguments therein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I omit not but mention, and that usually, or rather evermore in his owne words, and doe also make answere thereunto. But I am loth any longer to detaine you: and therefore, I here leave you to the reading of that which followeth: and that which followeth to your owne judicious just, and equall censure: Beseeching God to guide us all unto his truth, &amp; to keepe &amp; esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish us therein continually, after that wee once see and know it. Amen.</p>
