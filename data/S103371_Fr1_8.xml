   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nnaeus Seneca</hi> comming from Corduba, (a Citty in the inner Prouince of Betique Spaine) to Rome, was presently aduanced to the honour of Knight-hood; whose O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations (al-be-it of great fame and note) were by the iniury of Time denied to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He had by his wife <hi>Elbia</hi> three sons, whose names were, <hi>L. Annaeus Seneca, Iulius Annaeus Gallio,</hi> and <hi>Annaeus Mela:</hi> who (because he was yongest) was left behinde at Corduba. The other two (to wit) <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Gallio,</hi> he committed to the tuition of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rullus Grammaticus, Cestius Smyrneus,</hi> and <hi>Asinius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio. Mela</hi> when he came to yeares of discretion, was by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made gouernour of his houshold affaires; and being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as well as his other brethren (by the fauour of the <hi>Caesars</hi>) with the order of Knight-hood, he married <hi>C. Acilia,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Acilius Lucanus,</hi> a famous Orator in the Proconsuls Court, and much esteemed for his wit among the better sort. Bt her (about the fourth of the Nones of Nouember, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Consulship of <hi>Caius Caesar Germanicus</hi> with <hi>Lucius Cecianus)</hi> he begat <hi>Marcus Annaeus Lucan;</hi> taking his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>e from his grand-father (by his mothers side) <hi>Acilius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> At length growing weary of the care of house-keeping, and desirous to liue with his brethren in more ease and quiet; he went with his sonne <hi>Lucan</hi> (being then but eight moneths old) to Rome, hoping that by the well managing of his wealth which he had gathered, it would in short space come so to passe, that he
<pb facs="8"/>
should be chosen Consull. Now as he was iourneying, it chanced that a swarme of Bees flying about the cradle wherein the childe was carried (as it is reported happened to <hi>Hesiodus)</hi> lighted and hung at his mouth; signifying (no doubt) the sweet and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable eloquence that should bee in that childe, whereof his workes giue good testimony. His Maisters and Tutors were <hi>Rhemnius Palemon,</hi> and <hi>Flavius Virginius,</hi> the one a famous Grammarian, the other a singular Rhetorician: Vnder whom he profited so well (the dexterity of his wit being furthered with his diligence) that within a very short space, he declaimed both in Greeke and Latine, to the great admiration of the Auditors. His Schoole-fellowes were <hi>Saleius Bassus,</hi> and <hi>Au. Persius</hi>: he held a long time in the grace and fauour of <hi>Nero</hi> (who in his yong yeares was brought vp vnder <hi>Seneca,</hi> this <hi>Lucans</hi> Vnkle) He was aduanced to the Office of Questor before due age; at what time he set out such excellent sword-playes, that by the peoples fauour, he was the next yeare called to the Office of Priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Augures, as <hi>Papinius Statius</hi> records.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Romam colitur chori Sacerdos.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Lucan</hi> was held in such admire,</l>
      <l>That he became Priest of the Quire.</l>
   </q>
   <p>He tooke to wife <hi>Polla Argentaria</hi> (the daughter of <hi>Pollus Argentarius</hi>) of whom <hi>Papinius</hi> in <hi>Calliope</hi> sings thus:
<q>
         <l>Nec solum dabo carminum nitorem,</l>
         <l>Sed taedis genialibus dicabo</l>
         <l>Doctam, at{que} ingenio tuo decorum,</l>
         <l>Qualem blanda Venus, daret{que} Iuno,</l>
         <l>Forma, simplicitate, comitate,</l>
         <l>Censu, sanguine, gratia, decore.</l>
         <l>The purer numbers that I write,</l>
         <l>Shall not with empty words be dight:</l>
         <l>But to thy geniall bed Il'e bring</l>
         <l>A Bride, that learnedly can sing:</l>
         <l>A wench, that Nature fram'd to sit</l>
         <l>The swelling torrent of thy wit.</l>
         <l>And such a milke-white Turtle-doue,</l>
         <l>As that the Emperesse of loue,</l>
         <l>
            <pb facs="8"/>Or else the Queene of Maiesty,</l>
         <l>Might as a boone bestow on thee.</l>
         <l>She is so faire, so sweet, so kinde,</l>
         <l>So rich, and of so noble minde,</l>
         <l>So match esse in her gracefull port,</l>
         <l>So mouing to Ambrosian sport.</l>

      </gap>d in <hi>Pompey's</hi> Theater; and <hi>Nero</hi> hauing promised by <hi>Chuius Rufus,</hi> that he himselfe in person would act the Fable of <hi>Niobe: Lucan</hi> (stepping out vpon the stage) recited certaine vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s <hi>extempore</hi> in the praise of <hi>Orpheus:</hi> for which he had a crowne of Laurell bestowed on him. Whereupon <hi>Nero</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing a spleene against him, forbid him euer after to frequent the Market-plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>, and Theater, or to make any verses. Of which <hi>Papinius</hi> saith thus:
<q>
         <lg>
            <l>Ingratus Nero dulcibus Theatris,</l>
            <l>Et noster tibi praeferatur Orpheus.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>
               <hi>Nero</hi> thou shewd'st thy selfe ingrate</l>
            <l>To dulcet Theaters, for hate</l>
            <l>Thou bar'st to him that did rehearse</l>
            <l>More pleasing numbers then thy verse.</l>
         </lg>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Who hoping to be reuenged on <hi>Nero,</hi> he ioyned himselfe to the <hi>Pisionian</hi> treason: But the plot being discouered, hee persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not in the deniall of his fault: but crauing mercy for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he accused his innocent mother to be also one of this conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie: hoping that this empiety might bee a meanes to procure pardon at the hands of an impious Prince. But hauing receiued the sentence of condemnation, and liberty giuen to him to chuse what death he would▪ he writ certaine verses vnto his father; and (after a large banquet) causing the veines of his armes to be opened, he dyed bleeding. But when his feet and hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waxe cold, and that he was now at the point to resigne his latest breath, hee recited certaine verses of his, which hee had made on a Souldier in the same case. <hi>Lib. 3.</hi>

         <l>When Rome did wash my infant sides</l>
         <l>With moisture that in Tyber glides.</l>
         <l>Then was I from the <hi>Forum</hi> tane,</l>

      <hi>Papinius</hi> saith, that being but a Boy, he writ the combate of <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles:</hi> he wrot also the feasts of <hi>Saturne,</hi> ten Bookes of <hi>Sylues,</hi> the Tragedie of <hi>Medea</hi> (not perfected) the iourney of <hi>Orpheus</hi> to Hell, the burning of Rome, the sacking of Troy, with the misery of King <hi>Priamus.</hi> Hee wrote an inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue Oration against <hi>Octauius Sagitta,</hi> that murthered <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> with many other Fables and Epistles. He vndertooke the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> but being preuented by death, he wrot but onely ten Bookes, and of them ten perfected but three, with the helpe of his wife, the other seuen were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently corrected, and published after his death. <hi>Fabius Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> saith, that hee was rather to bee accounted an Orator then a Poet, as being loftie and vehement in his stile, full of excellent sentences: so admirable and wittie in his Orations, as that hee seemes to expresse that singular Elegancie and Maiesty that is obserued in <hi>Virgil.</hi> His Epitaph may yet bee seene in Rome, graued on a marble Monument in old Characters, thus.</p>
