vnto the Maiestie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God, the prosperous and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Estate thereof: beseeching
God the Father, for Christ Iesus hys
sonnes sake, to bee mercifull to all his
seruaunts, euen his whole Militant
Church, scattred farre and wide ouer
the face of the whole earth: both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
it in those trueths that it hath
recouered, from the sundrie grose and
superstitious errors of the former age,
and restoring it also vnto that vnitie
(in his good time) which it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
lost, and daily looseth, through
the vnchristian and vnhappy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these dayes of ours.</p>
   <p>And in this Church, let vs be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="8"/>
of that part thereof, which most
especially &amp; principally needeth our
remembrance: that is, the poore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
members of Christ Iesus, in what
place, for what cause, or with what
crosse soeuer: that it would please
God to minister into our hearts the
same spirit of compassion and feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
now in the time of their need, that
we would wish should be ministred
into theirs, in the time of our need, for
them to become suters for vs. And let
vs wish them al from the Lord (in his
good time) the same ioyfull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and till his good time bee, the
same measure of patience, that wee
would wish vnto our owne soules, or
would haue them intreate and praye
for at his hands for vs, if euer our case
shall be as theirs is at this present.</p>
   <p>And forasmuch as those Churches

<pb facs="8"/>
and (for the most part) much more
neede the prayers of Christ his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Congregation, than those that
are vnder his hande in the House of
affliction: Let vs beseech him for
them also, that he will giue vnto each
and euerie of them, a thankfull recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of those his benefites, a sober v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them, and a Christian employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, to his glorie that hath
sent them.</p>
   <p>And in these our prayers, let vs be
mindfull also of the Churche and
Countrey wherein we liue, yeelding
first and formost euer-more, our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
and hartie thankes-giuings, for
all his mercies and gracious fauours
vouchsafed this Land of ours: and
namely for our last, no lesse gracious
than meruailous deliuerance from our
enemies, and for all those good signes
and tokens of his louing fauor which
euer since, and daylie he sheweth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>And together (withall) let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
him, that while these dayes of
our peace doo last, hee will open our
eies to see, &amp; encline our harts to seek
after those things, which maye make
for the continuance, and establishing
of this peace long amongst vs.</p>
   <p>And (as by especiall dutie we all
stand bound) let vs commend vnto
his Maiestie, his chosen seruaunt <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
our Soueraigne, by his grace,
of <hi>England, France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland</hi> Queene,
Defendresse of the faith, and ouer all
estates and persons within these her
Dominions, (next and immediatelie
vnder God) supreame Gouernesse:
let vs beseech God (daylie more and
more) to perswade her Highnes hart,
that the aduauncement and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Kingdome of hers, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in the aduancement and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the Kingdome of his Sonne
Christ within it; that it may be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Maiesties speciall care and
studie, that both her Highnes in that
great place wherein GOD hath set
<pb facs="9"/>
her, and euerie one of vs in the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
degrees wherein we stand, may be
as carefull to testifie vnto the whole
world, a speciall care and endeuour
that we haue, for the propagation of
the Gospell of his sonne: as Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
hath shewen himselfe, by many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
both of olde and of late, (and
that of weight) that he hath caried &amp;
still carieth a speciall care of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
and welfare of vs all.</p>
   <p>Let vs commend also vnto God, the
seuerall Estates of the Land, for the
right honorable of the Nobilitie, and
of her Highnes priuie Councell; that
they may be carefull (from the spirite
of the Lord) to deriue al their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells;
that so God, which sendeth the
Councell, may send it good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
successe also, and maie confound
&amp; cast out the councels of the enemy.</p>
   <p>For the estate of the Cleargie, the
right reuerend Fathers in GOD, in
whose hand the gouernment of the
Church is, and all other inferior Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
that he will giue vnto each and
<pb facs="10"/>
euerie of them, sufficiēt graces for the
discharge of their functions, &amp; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(with the graces) both a faithfull
and a fruitful employing of them.</p>
   <p>For the Estate of Magistracie, and
namely for the Gouernors of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Citie: that they together with
the rest, according to the trust that is
reposed in them, may be no lesse care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
speedely, without delay; than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptly,
without partialitie, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
iustice to the people of God.</p>
   <p>For the Estate of the Commons,
that they all in a Christian obedience,
towardes each and euerie of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
and in a godly loue, with the
frutes and duties there of one towards
another, maye walke worthie of that
glorious calling whereunto they are
called. And that the blessings of the
Lord may not only be with vs for our
times, but successiuely also be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to our posterity: let vs beseech
God, that he will visit with the spirite
of his grace, the two Vniuersities,
<hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> all Schooles of
<pb facs="10"/>
learning, and places of education of
youth: that they being watered with
the deaw of his blessing, maye yeeld
foorth such plants, as may both serue
for a present supply of the Churches
need: and also in such sort furnish the
generations that are to come, that our
posteritie also may bee counted vnto
the Lord, for a holy seede, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
generation, as we our selues are.</p>
   <p>And thus recommending our selues vnto
the praiers of Christ his Church, as wee haue
commended Christ his whole Church by our
praiers vnto the Maiestie of Almightie God,
reposing our trust and confidence, neyther in
our owne prayers, nor in the Churches pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but in the alone mediation of Christ Iesus
our Aduocate: Let vs vnto him, (as vnto our
sole Intercessor) offer vp these our supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that hee maye present them to God his
Father, for the effectuall obtayning of these▪
and whatsoeuer graces else he knoweth need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for his whole Church, and for vs, calling
vppon him, as himselfe in his Gospell hath
taught vs.</p>
