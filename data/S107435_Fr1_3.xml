      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Christian Reader expect not to be courted with fruitlesse Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies; I desire only to informe thee concerning this present Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, which is now thine. That which I intended, whē my thoughts first looked this way, was my owne satisfaction. For though I were not a stranger to these Questions, nor tooke vp these tenents by occasion of the Kings Declaration (an asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion fastned upon many an honest man) but had declared my selfe therein for many yeares before, as some who are contrary-minded can beare me witnesse: Yet when of late they fell into agitation, I confesse the strange confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of most, the resolute sufferings of some began to stagger me. For I conceived, that I not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently searched, and that something surely had escaped me; else it was (I thought) not possible, that men of good
<pb facs="8"/>apprehensions, honest dispositions, and well qualified with sundry parts of learning should not only stick at them, but oppose them also even with hazzard. This was the cause why I not only weighed such arguments, as Treatises of this nature afforded: but such also as either my selfe could frame, or my poore slender reading help me unto. This I held fit to acquaint thee with, least thou shouldst perhaps think that I affected a <hi>Sciomachy</hi> or <hi>Umbratilous</hi> skirmish, making a great shew of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments only to make a greater shew of answeres. But God knowes I intended herein satisfaction, not ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to see what might be as well, as what was already said. To which purpose I have also faithfully related the reasons of our Adversaries, and added such weight unto them by pressing them home, as my weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing inabled me without partiality, desiring only light, which I alwaies professed to follow, if they afforded any. But here if I have at any time for pities sake left untouched certaine places of Scripture, miserably tortured, I feare wilfully wrested, (a common and great fault in them with whom we deale) let me be pardoned this injury. Shews and flourishes, which an Artist may convey into a well pen'd discourse, may goe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidences amongst the vulgar. He deserves not the name of a Scholar or Orator that cannot by this meanes make any Paradox extreamly probable; for it is not easy for a common eye to distinguish shadowes from substances, especially when they are wrapt up together under the specious titles of piety. And this was the only reason of my method, which being that of the Schooles is
<pb facs="8"/>of all others (if used with sobriety) most satisfying. It is not then the pleasing of thy fancy with quaint language, and apt cadences of words: nor the drawing of thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with patheticall exclamations of holinesse, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp;c. nor appeales to mens consciences, by which they are artificilly caught before encountred, which I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; to such straines I professe my selfe a stranger; but the unmasking of all apparences, and discovery of naked truth. And here let no man be offended, if I speak freely, that I have not found any convincing proofe in any point of their doctrine, wherein we differ, either out of the word of God, or well governed reason. It is therefore to be feared, that men seek themselves, not truth herein. And sure selfe-seeking is more waies then one; not only the desire of profit, preferment, favour, greatnesse: but those poorer phantasmes of popularity, opinion of being the un-erring <hi>Rabbies</hi> in the Church, or making good a side hunted after makes us guilty thereof. And amongst the rest there is no such selfe-seeking as singularity,<note place="margin">Signa singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritatis non continere se intra suos fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; fastidire dostrinas reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutas; indebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta doctorum &amp; doctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio; gaudere potius de alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ impugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </note> if the Schoolemen have given us its true characters; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others these. To loath common resolutions alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given; to appropriate to our selves the infallibility of our Doctors and Doctrines; to take more delight in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning our adversaries, then reconciling of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. If this be singularity, and singularity selfe-seeking it is easily seen who seek themselves. For not to speak of the two latter Characters, which are as the proper pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our Sabbatharians, <hi>I</hi> will only relate what you may read in <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Sprint</hi> concerning the first. <q>In this controversy <hi>(saith he)</hi> those reverend and goodly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="9"/>living in the times next aboue us were of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse and weake judgements: but those of latter daies more syncere and strict; God as it were rewarding the paines and diligence of every age with revealing some part of truth. The which thing as he did to them of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times before, reuealing unto them sundry truths, wherewith their predecessors never were acquainted: so dealt he with the Primitve Fathers in their severall times, and so perhaps he will doe with them that follow us. So he hath done to this age of ours; and as he hath done it in sundry other truths, so also in this of the Christian Sabbath.</q>
      <note place="margin">Mavult curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositas quaerere invenienda, quàm inventa intelligere. <hi>ib.</hi>
      </note> Singularity it seemes is a curious fancy, which chuseth rather to invent new, then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand those Tenents which are already received. Such <hi>(I confesse)</hi> was my ignorance as to beleeve that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary truths had been sufficiently revealed; as for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary revelations we bequeath them to such Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique spirits as affect them. My opinion also was, that those Pillars of our Church, that liv'd in the former age next above us in whom might be discerned the very spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Elias,</hi> had beeen no weak, remisse, unsincere (or to speak plain) prophane Gospellers. <hi>Sit studium solius ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis abs{que} fermento vanitatis,</hi> Let truth alone be studied, and all leaven of vanity avoided. But it hath been an ill lesson instill'd into the heads of young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by those that were heretofore the great leaders of the Disciplinarians, that howsoever the Ceremonies of the Church were in themselves tollerable, yet no way to be used by such as had preached against them. And the reason was as good, as the Doctrine, least the people see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="9"/>them in an errour in this, should believe them in nothing else, therefore needs must we magnify all our dictats whatsoever. But first, the supposition of the peoples scandalized infidelity is a meer fiction; was <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Peters</hi> doctrine the worse thought of, because his errour was reproved by <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Paul?</hi> Are the errours of <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi>

But suppose the people should thus stumble, must we therefore pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously adhere to our mis-opinions though but in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? Surely then they were not wise, whosoever wrote Retractations. The best that is, may possibly be mistaken, and if so let God have the honour of our humility. To have erred may be the shame of our naturall frailty: but to acknowledge our errors is the praise of our Christian ingenuity, and to reforme them our glory. I speak not this out of any hope conceived that this poore piece of mine should prevaile with any in this kind. It is storied that when <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew was sent to <hi>Cajus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in behalfe of his nation against the Greekes, that <hi>Appian</hi> who was sent by the Greeks against the Iewes spake first, and the Emperour was so enraged by <hi>Appian,</hi> that <hi>Philo</hi> was commanded out of his sight unheard.<note place="margin">

But if any will be pleased in the spirit of meeknesse to shew me a better way, I trust I shall neither be so wayward, as to take it amisse: nor so weak as not to profit by him. My only suit unto thee <hi>(Christian Reader)</hi> is, that thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use it with as single an eye, as the heart was syncere from whence it proceeded.
