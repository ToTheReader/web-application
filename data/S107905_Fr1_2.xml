These thingis whē ye se done / thē let vs lament &amp; a knowelege the wrath of God powered forth ayenst the synnes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.

Nether / trwly / be these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicciōs ād prophecies setforth in vaine. For God wold haue them read, that the godly hertes might prepare them selues vnto the manyfold perels ād batails / ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne whiche is the very chirche of God / in whiche the voice of the gospel of the sone of god sown / thei might knowe that same to be the chirche which shal fight with the ennemies of cryst / which by his death hath for vs apeaced the wrath of the eternal father / and now rysen raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to glorifie his chirche with lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting. Thei mought knowe that these sorowful miserable calamitis shall haue an ende / euen then / when the chirche ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp ayene from dethe shal be beutifyed with glori euerlasting. Of theise thingis forasmiche as God himself very largely premonissheth vs in this boke writen of Daniel / and hath constituted euen the ordir of the tymes and ages / apointing in a maner the very limites ād bowndes of the world / sewerly the reading of this boke must nedis be profitable to good<note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> men. Also the aungel himself in the ende of this boke exhorteth this laste age to
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
this lesson where he saith. Daniel thou shalt stonde in thy course or lotte into the ende / that is. Thou shalt do this office. Thou shalt teche and confirme the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And cryst himself doth not onely dedu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce vs vnto the reading of this boke / but also commandeth vs attentyuely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder of how waighty and great thinges Daniels prophecye techeth vs / saying / whoso read it / let him take hede / whiche saying gretely moueth vs to reade this boke the gladlyer with the more diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Besydis this / it is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very breif cōpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious some and reherceall of the storye<note place="margin">A monar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chie is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ouer all the worlde.</note> of the hole worlde / euen from the firste monarchye to the laste / setting befor our eyes the cleare examples of the good ād euilprinces and rulers.</p>
   <p>Of the profite of this boke / it shalbe spoken more here aftir. But to inuyte all men vnto the reading of Daniel / I haue added breif notes. For the sayingis of the prophets be so plentuouse that thet cannot be all at once out drawne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al be it these my bare and sclender cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentaris be not able to satisfie the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mater / yet it profiteth to put men in minde of the cheif maters / and as it were with my fynger to point them to those places which the diligent readers
<pb facs="5"/>
being studiouse / may by their owne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion afterward turne to / &amp; behold them nyerer. There be verely in Daniel many stories which require an interpretor. And in these / I think my labour to profire the yougth. Whiche my labours I permitte to the iugement of the godly and lerned / which shal iuge of this my boke both ient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and louingly. And because it is comō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed to dedicate bokis to princes and rulers / which vsage may haue many pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bable and graue causes, My mynde is to dedicate vnto you (most noble prīce) this my labour and litle boke / that when I hear your good will towerd the chirche of cryste and to honeste studies, to be pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed / I wolde therfore declare also this your vertewe vnto the students / exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to loue ād reuerēce godly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / and in their praiers commende them with their comons vnto God. Great is the infirmite of man / greter is the fury of the deuil / which brening in the hatered of god / as he thrusted out our first parēts to fall into these miserable sorouful cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities / euen so studieth he perpetually to hurte Crystes chirch. And cheifly he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth awaite at the higheste head therof / &amp; of our lyfe: nether is there any so great wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedom which can wel perceyue howe gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
perel there is in euery gouernance and regiment.</p>
   <p>Wherfore all princes conioined vnto the chirche of God / ought with the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all faithful to be holpen / that God whiche geueth helthe vnto kings wold once rule their counsess and bowe their myndes &amp; their enforcements vnto their owne and to the publik sauing helthe. Of this thig the readers shuld be monisshed in this kinde of dedicacions. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of noble and clear examples / shuld exhort the same princes thēselues vnto modesty moderaciō / &amp; to pyte / not to slaye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ohō so euer the aduersaries of god wold haue killed / but to fere God. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples / for this ende hath God set befor their eyes / to call them and their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to the study and scole of vertew. I ther fore besech God hertely the father of Ie su Cryste our delyuerer to preserue you / &amp; so to gouern you / that your gouernance be happye &amp; prosperouse to you / to your countrye / &amp; to the chirche of cryste / euen the very trewe comonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all. So be it. In the Calends of Ianuary. 1545. transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
