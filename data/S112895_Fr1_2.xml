      <hi>TO THE MOST Reuerend Father in GOD, RICHARD,</hi> the Lord Archbishop of Canterburie <hi>his Grace, Primate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane of all <hi>England,</hi> one of his Maiesties most Honorable priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and Chancelor of the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of</hi> Oxford.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, and my gratious good Lord: the common Apologie that is made for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of bookes (<hi>viz.</hi> the intreatie &amp; importunitie of friēds) with a complaint, notwithstanding, of the excessiue number thereof already; I take to bemuch like that formal speech vsed by guests at great feasts: who will
<pb facs="3"/>seeme to finde fault with the excesse of cheere and superfluitie of dishes; &amp; yet taste and eate of euerie one that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The best Apologie (I suppose) my self and others can make herein (for, so many Criticks haue we in these daies, that nothing can well passe without an Apologie) is the necessitie or rather ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of this age: wherein, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold opposition to Trueth, and the most shamefull dishonour to Pietie (the one by Papists and Schismatickes; the other by Atheists and Libertines) do seeme to call, as <hi>Moses</hi> somtimes did to the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> to put euerie man his sword by his side (that hath skill to handle it) and to consecrate his hands vnto God, in the zeale and defence of them. In perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which dutie, if there bee any thing, in this simple Work, worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; I humbly cōsecrate the same (next vnto God) to the honour of your Grace: to whome it doth most iustly belong; both in regard of my bounden duetie (as your seruant) and of your Graces sundry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
<pb facs="3"/>and benefittes towardes mee. To which, please it you to adde your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patronage of this small Treatise, against the calumnies of such Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries as it hath to incounter with; I shall thinke my selfe yet more deepely ingaged (in any possible seruice) to your good Lordshippe. Thus, crauing your Honorable acceptance of my poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors; I humbly take my leaue: with hartie and earnest prayer to God, for your Graces health and happinesse (to the prosperous and good estate of this our Church) long to continue.</p>
