      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here this Tragedie was for furniture of part
of the grand Christmasse in the Inner Temple
first written about nine yeares agoe by the right
honourable Thomas now Lorde Buckherst,
and by T. Norton, and after shewed before her
Maiestie, and neuer intended by the authors therof to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
yet one W. G. getting a copie therof at some yongmans
hand that lacked a little money and much discretion, in the last
great plage. an. 1565. about v. yeares past, while the said Lord
was out of England, and T. Norton farre out of London,
and neither of them both made priuie, put it forth excedingly
corrupted: euen as if by meanes of a broker for hire, he should
haue entised into his house a faire maide and done her villanie,
and after all to bescratched her face, torne her apparell, berayed
and disfigured her, and then thrust her out of dores dishones<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

In such plight after long wandring she came at length home to
the sight of her frendes who seant knew her but by a few to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
and markes remayning. They, the authors I meane,
though they were very much displeased that she so ranne abroad
without leaue, whereby she caught her shame, as many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
do, yet seing the case as it is remedilesse, haue for common

her in such forme as she was before. In which better forme
since she hath come to me, I haue harbored her for her frendes
sake and her owne, and I do not dout her parentes the authors
will not now be discontent that she goe abroad among you good
readers, so it be in honest companie. For she is by my encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and others somewhat lesse ashamed of the dishonestie
done to her because it was by fraude and force. If she be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

for it. If not, but that she shall be still reproched with her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
missehap, or quarelled at by enuious persons, she poore
gentlewomā wil surely play Lucreces part &amp; of her self die for
shame, and I shall wishe that she had taried still at home with
me, where she was welcome: for she did neuer put me to more
charge, but this one poore blacke gowne lined with white that
I haue now geuen her to goe abroad among you withall.</p>
