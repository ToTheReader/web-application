   <head>The Preface to the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, Christian Reader, the ancient and iust complaint of our holy, &amp; wise Forefathers, that Man of his weaken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s affect the knowledge of certayne forraine, childish and fruitlesse thinges, &amp; not to apply earnestly his mind to the <hi>Consideration</hi> of that <hi>Punctum vnde pendet Aeternitas,</hi> of that wherupon eternall saluation relyeth, which is only the <hi>true Fayth &amp; Religion.</hi> The consideration of the subtill course of the seas, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion of Planets, of the inestimable riches of the whole mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall world is but beggery, and misery in respect of the diligent search and consideration of the true Church &amp; Religion. What Monarch had euer such Embassadours as are the fiue senses of man? Or such Solicitors as are his desires? or such Executioners as are his passiōs? or such a Lord Steward of his house as is Reason? or such a Secretary of State as his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? or such a Treasurer as is his memory? or such a president or cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander as is his Will? all which inuiteth him to imploy whatsoeuer be hath in earnest, graue, &amp; wise <hi>Consideration,</hi> to find out the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of the which there is nothing but eternall misery &amp; damnation.</p>
   <p>Those Creature which want reason go towards their end, through a meere naturall Inclination, which is, as if they were moued by another &amp; not by thēselues, because they consider not the reason of their end, &amp; that eyther to an end apprehended, as it hapneth in the case of beasts, or not apprehended, as it is with inanimate creatures, which want all kind of knowledge &amp; <hi>Consideration.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But man who is not a meere materiall creature as others are, but is spirituall &amp; immortall, as he hath a more eleuated &amp; noble end; so also must he needs haue a more noble means, for the reaching &amp; arriuing to so excellent an end, which is only <hi>Consideration.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Since then <hi>Consideration</hi> in it selfe is so noble &amp; excellent a thing in man, I haue set downe heer of set purpose the meanes to attayne to the true Religion, &amp; the Grounds therof by way of <hi>Consideration.</hi> For as in matters of great consequence &amp; moment, <hi>Consideration</hi> speciall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> should be imployed; the finding of the true Religion being a matter aboue all others of moment and great consequence, I could not vse a fitter means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o attayne so noble a treasure, as is that, wherupon relyeth our eternall saluatiō. To this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd I haue set down in this first Part &amp; Treatise twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foure <hi>Considerations,</hi> wherby it shalbe easy to the vnpassionate &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader, to find out, by the grace of God, the true Church and Religion.</p>

   <p>Of set purpose I haue omitted to requite some Minister his bitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> words in my behalfe, his Paradoxes, Vntruths, Impertinencyes, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes, Ignorance, Immodesty, Folly, &amp; Scurrility specifyed in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construed letter of his vnworthy to be refuted, known well to such as best know me, not to be so much subiect to such bitternes and insultatiō of speach, which <hi>non parit victoria laudem,</hi> not intending to encounter him in the lik stile with <hi>maledictum pro maledicto,</hi> leauing that as heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to such a Puritan Minister: my wordes shall still beseeme my selfe, shal haue modesty &amp; truth for their characters, they shall offēd no chast eares, and shall not proceed of any like blacke Hypocondriall humour, giuing alwaies this, as a Caueat to such a Minister —
<q>—Capere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.</q> Yet if once againe I be stirred vp by such men to obserue &amp; keep <hi>legem talionis,</hi> let them thanke themselues, who, without any occasion offered, do prouoke me against my nature &amp; inclination <hi>paribus concurrere telis:</hi> Yet in such a requytall I shall euer obserue the admonition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke <hi>Ne quid nimis,</hi> to shoot rather too short thē too far at such rouers, knowing well such sharpnes in wordes to be the whetstone of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which mens myndes are soone moued but hardly reconciled: wishing alwayes that such a Minister should not haue forgot that rule of S.

The light &amp; more simple sort in the Church are deceaued by their errors, whē as they cānot seduce such as are strōg in the truth of fayth.
