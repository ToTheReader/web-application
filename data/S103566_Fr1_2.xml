auncient Custome, but farther be induced to the
receiuing of it with the greater cheerefulnesse in
your owne Person, assuring my selfe that your
Highnesse Example will serue to draw on many
Inferiours, eyther to take it more commonly and
willingly themselues, or at the least, to esteeme
it more reuerently in others. Now the God of
Heauen, who hath planted that Grace in you,
which to the great content and comfort of my
Soule, I perceiue to encrease daily, confirme it in
you, and you in it, to the glory of his Name, the
good of his Church, and the Saluation of your
