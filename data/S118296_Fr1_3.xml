In which discourse, is diuerse curious histories, some auncient prophesies, and other matters, whereby most euidently appeareth: that he whom the Seigneurie of Venice hath held as prisoner for the space of two yeres and twentie two dayes, is the right and true king of Portugall Dom Sebastian.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the end of the moneth of August last past (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) I receiued a packet of Letters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n the Italian tongue, wherein one was written in fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> of the king of Portugal <hi>Dom Sebastian,</hi> who was as then said to be prisoner in Venice. This letter was directed to the most Christian king, and I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with all possible diligence I could vse, and caused it to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to his Maiestie. In the same packet there was also a further traduction of the same letter; which hauing thus happened to my hands, I acquainted diuerse of my friends therewith, who made such reckening and esteeme thereof, as it were a matter beyond all other most rare and maruellous. This letter was of such power, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked and kindled in the hearts of my said friends, an extreme loue and affection towards the Prince, and begot in them likewise a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement desire, to see him in libertie and peaceable possession of his kingdome, as if themselues had bene subiects thereto belonging. So (referring that to such as were more obliged by dutie, and had more particular interest in such businesse,) after the receipt of this leeter, I laboured all I might to vnderstand some tydings of his estate and successe. Hauing then learned, that a Religious man, of the order of the preaching Friers (named brother <hi>Ioseph Texere</hi> a Portuguese, one knowne to the greatest and meanest in Europe, as also here very well) had writtē to this Citie to a Bishop a friend of his, a discourse of matters happening since the said king began to enterprise his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke voyage: I so much importuned a nephew to the sayd Bishop, who kept this discourse in his hands to send to his vncle, as no excuses might serue from transferring it to mine. The reading thereof was to me so pleasing and agreeable, as both it encouraged and cut off all supposition of labour, in the speedie writing and copying it out. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by this meanes this version in mine owne power, I thought I should commit an inexcusable fault, if I should reserue to my proper vse such a strange accident and worthy regard. Hereupon attending

      </gap>s, written by him since the sending of the Discourse to the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap>, and wherewith it pleased his Lordship to acquaint me. Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> is annexed hereunto, because it containes some points that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
