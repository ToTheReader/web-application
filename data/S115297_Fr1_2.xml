      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here commend vnto thee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader a table of Repentance, now put into a little Tract, collected from that graue, learned, &amp; godly Divine, <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bolton.</hi> I could haue beene content to
<pb facs="3"/>
haue stayed the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, vntill such time, in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might haue beene prevailed with to print it; for there cannot but want much beauty and lustre which it might haue had, if it had been set forth or perused to be fitted for the Presse by him that first gaue life vnto it; but being inforced to it by the importunity of many well affected, both farre
<pb facs="3"/>
and neere; &amp; I vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fountaine sealed vp, considering the good that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to many in the meane time by it. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued by the Authors leaue no longer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse the same to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate vse, but to impart it to a publike good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially considering, first, how few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the right nature of Humiliation,
<pb facs="4"/>
and Repentance, no more than <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was with regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: that though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boast of it, few haue it, when alas it's plaine, without true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there is no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this table having so perspicuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnsolded the nature of this grace, those that haue a beginning of it, may from hence adde an increase to their store; and they that
<pb facs="4"/>
want it, may here see the way and meanes of obtaining it. Secondly, the extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of fasting and prayer, a duty of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account amongst Gods Children, which hath alwayes beene wonderfully blest with a happy successe, in so much, as albeit their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prayers returne not empty without a blessing, yet respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those prayers
<pb facs="5"/>
which are joyned with fasting, they seeme bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and blasted, which otherwise are fruitfull and full eared. How then could I withhold this which by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the judgement of judicious Christians, cannot but bee of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vse and helpe vnto such a blessed and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull ordinance? Thirdly, these times call for it, to fast and pray and cry mightily vnto
<pb facs="5"/>
God by our prayers, that wee may stand in the gappe, and make vp the breach: and from this little Tract wee may receiue much helpe in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. VVherefore I hope I shall neede no further perswasion for thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptance, than that hereby if the fault be not thine owne, thou mayest receiue much good and comfort to thy soule: which if thou
<pb facs="6"/>
findest, giue God the glory, the Author thy thankes, and mee thy prayers. ⁂</p>
