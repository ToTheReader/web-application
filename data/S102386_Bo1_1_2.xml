   <p>THE wryter of this Treatise, hauing ended this first part and beinge wel entred into the second, was partlye by euil disposition of bodye, and partlye by other sodaine busines falling vpon him, enforced to leaue the place, wherein he wrote this.

This (I say) is the doctrine of the Catholicke Church, and hath bene alwayes. And therfore to this pointe meaneth the autour of this Treatise, to exhorte Catholicks in Englande, and to make humble supplication to ther soueraine Ladye and Princesse, for some more fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tolleration with them for ther cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.

   <p>
      <hi>But</hi> notwithstanding, because<note place="margin">The contents of the thirde parte of this Treatise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>msed.</note> Princes hartes are peculierly in the handes of God, &amp; the euentes of such matters as this is, depend altogether of his high prouidence, which oftene times, for a better ende, disposeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then our hope or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is: therfore, if ether by this holy prouidence of God, (for causes best knowen to him selfe,) or by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of the aduersarie, there should not folowe from her Maiestie that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of mercye and clemencie, which we haue great cause to hope there will: yet I saye, in that case, not to leaue Catholikes altogether desolate or comfortles, he promiseth to handle in thother parte, certayne considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherby they maye be reléeued, a middest their gretest miseryes, and


<pb n="70" facs="87"/>
be encoraged also, to beare patiently, and with contentation, or rather with ioye and consolation, what soe euer pressure shal be layd vpon them, for Christ, and this his Catholique cause: shewinge vnto them, what great priuelege and prerogatiue, they haue in the loue of Christ, in that they are admitted to suffer with him, in this his glorious cause, for the which he suffered him selfe, and for the mayntenance whereof, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not to haue euerlasting care, and perpetuall cogitation: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlye, can not but most louinglye assist them, with his holy grace, and swéete comfort, which indure aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie for the same: as he hath both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised &amp; sworne to doe, &amp; hath not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to perfourme his promise, with ouerplussage, to al those, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euer haue suffered for that quarel: strengthening them, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> present short time, &amp; soone after, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cōfusiō of ther enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpensing ther labors, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euerlasting glory, both in this life, and in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> life to come.

In hope of which reward, (from whiche no aduersitye can barre vs longe) he meaneth to exhort all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, quietly and with pacience, to repose them selues, and to beare out with Christian courage, what tempestes soeuer shall storme vppon them: assuring them that this is the best and onlye waye, to please God, and to saue their owne Soules: to aduaunce also, the Catholique fayth, and to molyfie or confound their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and detractours: and finallye to moue the great goodnes of God, for the inspiration of her Maiestie when time shalbee, to deale more fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye with them, and to haue some more milde and merciful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, of so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes of her true, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</p>
