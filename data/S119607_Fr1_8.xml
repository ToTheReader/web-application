      <l>IF thou wouldst understand the Deity;</l>
      <l>Behold the mystery of the holy Trinity:</l>
      <l>An Essence divine, eternall, infinite is hee,</l>
      <l>Spirituall, and of wonderfull magnanimity,</l>
      <l>Of power, of might and majesty,</l>
      <l>Of goodnesse, greatnesse and excellency,</l>
      <l>Of glory, continuance and quality;</l>
      <l>And is perfectly good unchangeably,</l>
      <l>From everlasting and perpetually,</l>
      <l>And is every where present repletively,</l>
      <l>Essentially, potentially and vertually,</l>
      <l>Which is seene by his admirable works apparantly,</l>
      <l>With our eyes and minde continually,</l>
      <l>From age to age universally.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This Almighty God incomprehensible,</l>
      <l>Omnipotent, invisible and incomparable,</l>
      <l>Immortall, incorruptible and unspeakeable,</l>
      <l>Dwelleth in light inaccessible;</l>
      <l>And is coequall, coessentiall and coeternall,</l>
      <l>Of one substance, immutable and unsearchable.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This high blessed Heavens Creatour,</l>
      <l>Is the earths creatures Conserver,</l>
      <l>Increaser, nourisher, repairer and governour</l>
      <l>By his omnipresent power.</l>
      <pb facs="15"/>
      <l>Although he dwels in Heaven principally;</l>
      <l>Yet hee is, and dwels on earth effectually;</l>
      <l>In the faithfull his elect especially,</l>
      <l>In his wisedome, grace and mercy.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Therefore be praised evermore the Trinity,</l>
      <l>Father, Sonne and holy Ghost in unity;</l>
      <l>This to believe is godly charity,</l>
      <l>Saving faith and holy piety;</l>
      <l>For speaking of Gods simple verity,</l>
      <l>Nought more beseemes then true simplicity.</l>
      <l>If further thou wouldst understand his Majesty.</l>
      <l>Goe in, behold and see his excellency;</l>
      <l>For what I know of his all-knowing worth,</l>
      <l>With single heart I have simply here set forth;</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus wishing that my labours may,</l>
      <l>To heavens rest thy soule convey.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No attributes can sufficiently expresse the essence of God, but the attributes which be given unto God, be taken out of the usage of mens speech, and so applyed unto the nature of God, to the end that those things which cannot be properly expressed by any toung nor language, may yet at the least wise be by the figures of mens speeches in some sort shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whatsoever therefore is spoken of God, is so in God, as it serveth to helpe our weake under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to conceive in our reason, and to utter in our speech, the majesty of his divine nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and essence; for of himselfe he is infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable, in his essence, might, power, and working.</p>
