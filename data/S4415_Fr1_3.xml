Godlines in the power of it hath, by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

Look well, and you will finde, it is not
all gold that glistereth: Beleeve it, <hi>A

the man the Lord lookt for, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22.
Wherfore as you meet with my labours
in publicke, so accept of this for you, &amp;
yours in private.</p>
   <p>You have many other helps; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
resolved to pitch upon something
of this kind, and finding all said before
that could bee sayd, I pitcht upon this
