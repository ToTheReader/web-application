   <head>THE PROLOGVE
TO THE READER OF
the Metamorphω-sis of AIAX.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat Captaine AIAX, as is
well knowen to the learned,
and shall here be published
for the vnlearned, was a
warrier of Graecia; strong,
headdy, rash, boisterous, and a terrible
fighting fellow, but neither wise, learned,
staide, nor Polliticke. Wherefore falling
to bate with Vlisses, &amp; receiuing so fowle
a disgrace of him,<note place="margin">Ouid. Meta. lib. 12.</note> to be called foole afore
company, and being bound to the peace,
that he might not fight with so great a
Counseller; he could indure it no longer,
but became a perfit mal-content, viz. his
hat without a band, his hose without gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
his wast without a girdle, his bootes
without spurs, his purse without coine, his
head without wit, and thus swearing he
would kill &amp; slay; first he killed all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
beasts he met, which made Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Menelaus now, more affraid then
Vlisses, whereupon he was banished the
townes presently, and then he went to the
<pb facs="9"/>
woods and pastures, and imagining all the
fat sheepe he met, to be of kin to the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Vlisses, because they ran awaie from
him, he massacred a whole flocke of good
nott Ewes. Last of all hauing no bodie else
to kill, poore man killed him selfe; what
became of his body is vnknowen, some say
that wolues and beares did eate it, and that
makes them yet such enemies to sheepe
and cattell.<note place="margin">Lib. supra dicto.</note> But his bloud as testifieth <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidius</hi>
the excellent Historiographer, was
turnd into a Hiacint, which is a verie nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
kinde of grasse or flower.</p>
   <p>Now there are many miracles to be
marked in this Metamorphosis, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the credite of the same: for in the
grasse it selfe remaines such pride of this
noble bloud, that as the grasiers haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me of their credits, (and some of them
may be trusted for 100000 poundes) the
ruther beastes that eate too greedily here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will swell til they burst, the poore sheep
still for an old grudge, would eate him
without salt (as they saie) but if they doe,<note place="margin">Salt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers baned sheepe.</note>
they will soone after rot with it.</p>
   <p>Further I read that now of late yeares,<note place="margin">Rabbles lib. 1. cap. 13.</note>
a French Gentleman son to one <hi>Monsieur
<pb facs="9"/>
Gargasier,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cōme Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasier co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoit l'esprit excellent de Gargantua a l'inuētiōd, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torche cul.</note> &amp; a young Gentleman of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
spirit &amp; towardnesse, as the reuerēt
Rabbles (<hi>quem honoris causa nomino,</hi> that is,
whom I should not name without sauere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerēce)
writeth in his first booke 13. Cha.
but the story you shall find more at large
in the xiiij. booke of his tenth Decad.<note place="margin">Lib. Fictitius</note> This
yong gentleman hauing taken some three
or foure score pils to purge melancholy,
euery one as big as a Pome Citterne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his man to mowe an halfe acre of
grasse, to vse at the priuy, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāding
that the owners (to saue their hay
perhaps) sware to him it was of that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
house of AIAX, and therefore reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of purpose onely for horses of the race
of Bucephalus, or Rabycano, yet he would
not be perswaded: but in further contempt
of his name, vsed a phrase that he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at his being in the low Countreys, and
bad <hi>Skite vpon AIAX.</hi> But suddenly (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were the curse of the people, or the
nature of the grasse I know not (he was
strikē in his posteriorūs with S. Anthonies
fier; and dispairing of other helpe, he went
on Pilgrimage in hope of remedy hereof
to Iapana, neare Chyna: where he met a
<pb facs="10"/>
French Surgeō, in the vniuersity of Miaco
that cured him both of that &amp; the Verol,
that he had before in his priorūs; with the
Momio, of a Greciā wēch, that Vlisses bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in his trauell, vpon the coast of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Aethiopia; and so he came back again
by <hi>Restinga des ladrones,</hi> through <hi>S. Lazaro,</hi>
and crossing both the Tropicks, <hi>Cancer</hi> &amp;
<hi>Capricorne,</hi> he came by <hi>Magellanes,</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he found no straights there; but came
from thence straight home. And so in 24.
houres saile, and two or three od years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
he accomplished his voyage, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to take fresh wine &amp; water at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
de bona speranza.</hi> Yet ere he could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his healthfully, he was faine to make
diuerse vowes (for now he was growē very
religious with his long trauell.) Among
which one was, that in remēbrance of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
of all meats, he would honor the Chine
of beefe most: an other was, that of all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the house, he should doe honour to
that house of office, where he had cōmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that scorne to AIAX: and that there,
he should neuer vse any more such fine
grasse, but rather, teare a leafe out of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linsheds
Chronicles, or some of the books
<pb facs="10"/>
that lie in the hall; then to commit such a
sin against AIAX. Wherefore immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
on his cōming home, he built a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
priuy, and in the most conspicuous
place thereof, namely iust ouer the doore;
he erected a statue of AIAX, with so grim
a countenance, that the aspect of it being
full of terror, was halfe as good as a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor:
and further to honour him, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the name of the house, &amp; called it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the name of this noble Captaine of the
greasie ones (the Grecians I should say) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IAX:
though since, by ill pronunciation,
and by a figure called <hi>Cacophonia,</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
is changed, and it is called a Iakes.</p>
   <p>Further when the funerall oration was
ended,<note place="margin">Hic desunt non paucae de ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone aeth cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> to doe him all other complements,
that appertained to his honor; they searcht
for his petigrew, and an excellent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,
and a Harold, by great fortune,
found it out in an old Church booke in the
Austen Friers at Genoua: and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed

   <p>By all which you may see, that it is but
lacke of learning, that makes some fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
seeke out stale English Etymologies
of this renowmed name of AIAX. One
imagined, it was called so of blacke iacks;
because they looke so slouenly, that a mad
French man wrote, we did cary our drinke
in our bootes: but that is but a bald Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology,
and I will neuer agree, that Iacke,
though he were neuer so blacke, should be
thus slaundered. But if you stand so much
vpon your English, and will not admitte
our Greeke, and our Romane tongue, you
shall see I will cast about, to haue one in
English for you. First then, you haue heard
the old prouerbe (age breedes aches) now
you must imagine, that an old man, almost
<pb facs="13"/>
pound with an vgly Mopsa, sayd, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a greatsigh; Oh, what a match were
this, were the woman away? But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
that shall be hereafter discouered, will
so confound this Gentleman with the
strong breath, that saue we cary about vs
some traytors, that are ready to take his
part, he should neuer be able so much as
to blow vpon you. Yet I would haue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
readers (of what sort soeuer) thus
farre satisfied, that I tooke not this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
vppon me voluntarily, but rather in
mine owne defence; and standing vpon
the <hi>puntilio</hi> of honour, hauing bene cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
as you may partly see in the letter
precedent, by one, as it seemes, of the
Captaines owne countrey-men: for his
name is <hi>Philostilpnos,</hi> which I thought at
first, was a word to coniure a spirite, till at
last, a fellow of mine of Cambridge, told
me the <hi>Philo</hi> was Greeke, and that he
would say in English, that he loueth clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
Now I being bound by the Duello,
hauing accepted the challenge, to seeke
no aduantage, but euen to deale with him
at his owne weapon, entred the lists with
him, and fighting after the old English
<pb facs="13"/>
maner without the stockados, (for to voine
or strike below the girdle, we counted it
base and too cowardly) after halfe a score
downright blowes, we grew to be friends,
and I was content to subscribe, Yours &amp;c.
And to the end I may aunswer him in the
same language, I am called <hi>Misacmos,</hi>
which is cosin and ally to his name, and it
signifies a hater of filthinesse, and to all
such as are of kin to either of our names or
conditions, we commend this discourse
