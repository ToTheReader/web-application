      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ighte honorable and my singular good Lord and Master, vvhen I had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and called to my remembraunce the opinion and sayings of the sage and auncient VVriters, that one man should be an instructer to an other, by seeking and paynes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to doe them good: so at sundry times haue I stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and deuised vvith my selfe vvhat thing to take in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">

Therfore at sundrie times as I haue had leasure, I haue compyled and vvritten this base and simple vvorke, calling to remembraunce the saying of Plinie, vvho

thought all that time lost vvhich he did not bestovve at his booke: I beeing of all other most simple, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding this enterprise haue I taken in hande, to publishe this simple booke vnto all men. And for that, all my labours be due vnto your Honorable Lordship, according to my bounden dutie I preferre it vnto your Honor, hoping that your Lordship vvill voutchsafe to take it in good parte, and to receyue this barbarous vvorke, more to take it as my good vvill (vvhiches is to offer things of much more excellencie) than the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the vvorke, for that it is but simple. AÂnd so shall I not onely be satisfied, but also further encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged heereafeer to trauell, according to the simple gifte and talent that God hath giuen vnto me: for that it is not altogither gathered out of other bokes, but that the greatest part is deuised and practised by me. Therefore I trust my labours (suche as they be) shall not hynder the cunning and learned sorte, but further the late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners that are as yet not vvell instructed. And thus I ceasse to trouble your honorable Lordeship any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, desiring you to take this simple thing in good part, as a true token and signe of my good vvill, beseeching God of his grace to prosper your Lordship in honor and vertue, vvith perfect health.
