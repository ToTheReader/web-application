   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE IOHN LORD POULET Baron of <hi>Hinton Saint George,</hi> All sanctified prosperitie.</head>
   <opener>Much honoured Lord,</opener>
   <p>THose reckonings that are daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the score, and runne long on without computation, swell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly to an height incredible: of such nature are my obligations towards your noble self, standing bound not onely for the principall, but the interest, the times and conditions of my lot being such, that untill now my utmost studies and endeavours could never purchase an opportunitie, in person to render the gratefull acknowledgements of your Lordships bounty towards my self, and to present the due homage of mine own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance:
<pb facs="3"/>
yea, I am by experience sensible of much difficultie to pick out the times and means of dutifull demonstrations, unlesse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie of place, and other conducing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances befriend us. Wherefore (my Lord) having with the long travell of gratefull thoughts to your Honour, and desire of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, brought forth these two-languag'd twins; I have ventured to deliver them into your Lordships hands (if they may be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come) and through them into the hands of others (if they may be worthy) aiming by them to acquaint the world with my perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obligations, and thankfull cogitations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Honour: and if they (by reason of their subject) shall discover any thing that may redound to the benefit of many or few, that that also may be reckoned to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as the means of my abilities: unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withall desiring, that this your bounty, and all your vertuous actions may be summed up to the glory of God, the authour of every good and perfect gift, both in us, and to us. To whose gracious tuition my constant pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er shall earnestly recommend your worthy person and noble family.</p>

      <hi>Your Lordships in the manifold obligations of dutifull observance,</hi>
