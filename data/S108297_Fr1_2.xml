   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Lorde Keeper of the great Seale of England,
T. B. wisheth increase of honour here, to the glory
of the Highest, and endlesse happines with the
Saints in the worlde to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finished (Right honourable)
the translation of the second part of
the French Academie, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with my selfe, vnto whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
I might commendand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
the same, as it were into a safe
Hauen to be preserued from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
and surging waues of this
Sea-like worlde, it came to my minde vpon sundry good
considerations, that your Honour might chalenge the same
as a thing that by all right appertaineth vnto your selfe.
For first, calling to my remembraunce, that the principall
scope aymed at by this Author in the penning of his book,
was to vphold the glorious essence of God against all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of Atheists, and that by the viewe of his diuine
woorkes in the creation of the bodie and soule of man, I
presently concluded with my selfe, that the defence of this
poynt against that viperous broode, was a woorke best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
the sacred seate of Magistracie, and such as for
<pb facs="3"/>
their places representing the person of the supreme Iudge,
wore by the infallible worde of trueth adorned with his
owne titles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. Nowe forasmuch as by
the speciall prouidence of God it hath pleased her royall
Maiestie to aduaunce you to that seate of magistracie, next
vnder her Highnesse, in which you are placed, it seemed
vnto mee, that I shoulde after a sort offer wrong vnto your
Honour, if I did not recommend vnto it the defence of the
highest ruler, whose person you doe in a higher degree
then others represent. Secondly, when I considered with
my selfe that this generation of Earth-wormes, which
place nature being but a creature in the roome of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and denie the immortalitie of soules after this life,
doe therein as much as lieth in them labour to put out the
light of their owne conscience, which yet could neuer be
wholly darkened in the mindes of anie, no not of the most
desperate Atheist that euer was, I thought it most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to craue, that your Honours lawfull protection in
the behalfe of this Booke, and of my small paines taken
therein for the benefite of my countrey, might bee as it
were a <hi>Sub paena</hi> serued vpon the whole rabble of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
incarnate, to cause them to appeare at that high court
of Conscience, in which you enioy the chiefest place next
vnder her sacred Maiestie, there to make answere to the
humble complaint of Conscience, vnto which they offer
such notorious violence. A third reason that moueth mee
to become an humble petitioner, that this booke may be
gathered vnder the wings of your Honours safe defence,
is the constant report of your great care, that none be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
into your retinue and familie, whose hearts are
possessed with a liking of that Antichrist of Rome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of whose iurisdiction, this dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Atheisme beganne first in this latter age of the
worlde to breake foorth, and hath nowe set footing euen
in those countries, from whence by a generall consent of
all Estates it hath beene banished long agoe. Let Florence
<pb facs="3"/>
testifie this to all posteritie succeeding, where that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Machiauel</hi> first beganne to budde, who hath nowe
spredde abroade his deadly branches of Atheisme ouer
the most countries in Christendome, insomuch as fewe
places but are so well acquainted with his doctrine, that
the whole course of mens liues almost euery where, is
nothing else but a continuall practise of his preceptes.
And yet <hi>Machiauel</hi> beeing Secretarie to that Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
estate, and employed altogether in ciuill affayres,
may seeme in some sort inexcusable, if hee bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with manie of those vnholy Fathers of Rome, who
making open profession to bee the Ring-leaders (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
of the whole worlde to bring them vnto GOD,
were plunged irrecouerably in this bottomlesse gulfe of
Atheisme. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth a Florentine borne, was
so farre from confessing Christ Iesus to bee the Sonne of
God with <hi>Peter,</hi> whose Vicar hee woulde seeme to haue
beene, that hee blushed not openly to deride the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel, and to scoffe at Christ Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the Authour thereof. For vpon a time as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Bembo</hi> by occasion cited vnto him a place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
concerning the gladde tydings of saluation, this
sonne of perdition most blasphemously replied vpon him
in this manner, <hi>Howe profitable this fable of Christ hath
beene to vs and to our crewe is well knowen to all ages.</hi> A most
horrible saying, and such as coulde not proceede but from
a flatte Atheist: of whom also it is reported, that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
there was neither Heauen nor Hell after this life.
Birds of the same feather were <hi>Siluester</hi> the second, <hi>Benedict</hi>
the ninth, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, <hi>Iohn</hi> the three &amp; twentieth,
<hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, <hi>Paulus</hi> the thirde,
with diuers others of that rabble, of whome some vtterly
renounced God and betooke themselues to the Deuill,
some denyed the immortalitie of the soule, some taught
most damnable heresies, and all of them turned the
grace of our God into wantonnesse, denying God the
<pb facs="4"/>
onely Lorde, and our Lorde Iesus Christ, <hi>Iude verse</hi> 4.
It woulde require a long time to anatomize their seuerall
liues, and your Honours waightie affaires in behalfe of
this Church and Common-wealth will suffer no long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
in regarde whereof I am constrained in few words,
and yet in most humble wise to recommend my selfe and
these my poore labours to bee shrowded vnder your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
safe protection, most heartily crauing at the handes of
the highest, so to guide your Honor in the managing
of that great charge he hath called you vnto, as
may make most both for his own glory here,
and for your blessed and endlesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
else-where.
