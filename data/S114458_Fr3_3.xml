   <head>An aduertisement to the Reader.</head>
   <p>GOod reader, there was a booke of late published in London vnder this title, <hi>PERKINS,</hi> vpon the Lords praier. In it I haue double iniurie. First it was printed without my knowledge or consent. And secondly the booke is faultie both in the matter and manner of writing. In the matter, these things are not well set downe.</p>
   <p>First the commandement of praier, very easily to be kept. pag. 3.b.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Prayer is the restauration of the Gospell. 7.b.</p>
   <p n="3">3. The three first petitions concerne Gods glorie; the three latter, the meanes of Gods glorie. 1.b.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Gods name taken for his deitie, and not for his attributes or titles. 15.b.</p>
   <p n="5">5. A man must pray for the day of his death. 26.a.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Repentance is sufficient not only to bring a true faith, but also to renew it. 34.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>.</p>
   <p n="7">7. A lesson in the Lords praier taken out of Poperie. 45.a.</p>
   <p n="8">8. The doctrine of satisfaction for sinne is a most vile doctrine. 52.b.</p>
   <p n="9">9. God and the deuill agree in the manner of temptation. 61.b.</p>
   <p n="10">10. God offereth men the occasion to sinne. 62.a.</p>
   <p>Likewise the manner of writing hath other faults.</p>
   <p>First, in the middle of the Lords prayer, there is placed a discourse of the Lords supper.</p>
   <p n="2">2. The end of the Lords prayer is not expounded at all but friuolously.</p>
   <p n="3">3. There are very many places, which haue no common reason in them, as First, Gods angels doe his will in countenance. 39.b.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Our daily bread is communicating bread. 45.b.</p>
   <p n="3">3. To walke before God in the truth of the satisfaction of Gods iustice. 51.a.</p>
   <p n="4">4. To purge a cleere conscience. 51.b.</p>
   <p n="5">5. The pages 65.66.67. are so penned, as the reader cannot knowe what was my meaning.</p>
   <p>Now, considering by this vngoaly practise, Christian and well disposed people are much abused, to omit the iniurie done to my selfe: I thought it my duty to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse by publishing this treatise according as the points therein were deliuered: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I was not willing to haue set downe any thing in the way of Exposition of the Lords prayer: because it is alreadie sufficiently performed by others.</p>
