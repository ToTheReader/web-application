   <head>THE PREFACE, Containing diuers Annotations concerning the Rosarie of our Ladie: and the other Exercises here folovving: VVith the causes of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and printing the same, in this forme; and certaine commodities ensuing hereof.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR so much (benigne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reader) as euerie thing is better vnderstood, by the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his proper, or vsual name, it is first of al to be noted, that the name of ROSARIE (vvhich properly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the place vvhere roses doe grovve, or be reserued) is here vsed for the forme of praier, vvhich the renovvmed religious father S. Dominicke, about the yeare of our Lord 1200 (or as some thinke, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Priest called Peter of Amiens in Picardie, aboue an hundred yeares before) instituted, of certaine <hi>Pater nosters, Aues</hi> and <hi>Credes,</hi> together vvith certaine principal Mysteries to be meditated, in honour of our blessed Ladie, the virgin MARIE, framed by the number of fiue, like to a Rose, that hath fiue leaues: Whereof it is called the ROSARIE OF OVR LADIE.</p>
   <p>Which name of Rosarie is vsed someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes largely, and sometimes strictly, Taken largely it containeth fifteene Decades or Tennes (that is to say, fifteene times one Pater noster with tenne Aues) and three Credes; and hath fifteene Mysteries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereunto, that is, to euerie Decade
<pb facs="3"/> one Mysterie. And the same is also called OVR LADIES PSALTER, because it hath so manie Aues, or salutations of our Ladie, as there be Psalmes in the Psalter of Dauid, which are an hundred and fiftie. But strictly taken (as it is cōmonly ment, vvhen one is appointed for penance, or for pardon, or for other like cause to say a Rosarie) it containeth only fiue Decades, to witt, fiue Pater nosters and fiftie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, with one Crede. So that in the great Rosarie (or Ladie Psalter) be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained three particular Rosaries. And these three are resembled to three sortes of Roses, white, read, and damaske. For as these three colours doe signifie, ioye, payne, and glorie: so these three Rosaries do containe three sortes of Mysteries to be meditated, ioyful, sorowful and glorious.</p>
   <p>This forme of praying, the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Rosarie, did so accommodate to the vse of al faithfull persons, as it might be both a necessarie helpe to vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned people, and also a most profitable exercise to the most lerned in the world: as vvel for the better auoiding of idle, and hurtful distractions in the often repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same prayers, as also for the more fruitful eleuating of the mind, meditating vpon the chiefest Mysteries of our faith, vvhich concerne our Lord and Redemer his coming into this world,
<pb facs="3"/> and his going our of the same, and the happie effects of both.</p>
   <p>For touching his coming into this world (which vvas so long and earnestly desired and expected) in the first Rosarie are to be meditated these fiue ioyful Mysteries. First, how the Archangel Gabriel declared to the immaculate virgin MARIE, that she should conceiue and beare the Sonne of God. Secondly, hovv the same sacred Virgin visited her cosine Elizabeth.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, the Natiuitie of our Lord, with his Circumcision, and adoration by the Sages. Fourthly, the Purification of the vnspotted virgin mother, and Presentatiō of our Lord in the Temple. Fifthly, the finding of our Lord in the same Temple, vvhen at the age of twelue yeares, he had bene lost three dayes. Lykewise in the second Rosarie, are to be meditated fiue sorowful Mysteries pertaining to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours going forth of this world, by his most painful Passion, and death, which are these. First, his great agonie, and pensiue prayer in the garden. Secondly, his cruel whipping, vvith other manie extreme and vile iniuries. Thirdly, his crovvning vvith thornes, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to death. Fourthly, his carying of his ovvne Crosse. Fifthly, his crucifying, and death thereupon. Finally concerning the effects of his coming into this vvorld, and of his going forth of it againe, in

      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/> the third Rosarie are to be meditated these fiue glorious Mysteries. First, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our Lord. Secondly, his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension into heauen. Thirdly, the coming of the Holy Ghost. Fourthly, the blessed death and Assumption of our Soueraigne Ladie in soul and bodie. And fiftly, her Coronation and singular dignitie, aboue al other Saincts and seruants of God.</p>
   <p>Thus much in general is euident by the tradition, and continual practise of al Catholike nations, for the space of foure or fiue hundred yeares at least: that is, since the time of S. Dominicke, or before. And of the same antiquitie and authoritie is the vse of Beades, which were inuēted for the better obseruing of the prescribed number of prayers, in saying the vvhole Rosarie. And considering, that no man can vvel meditate vpon anie Mysterie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he both particularly know, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly remember, the special points therof, vve can nor doubt, but that Christian people vere both taught the particular pointes of al the aboue mentioned fiftene Mysteries, and also had some forme or order prescribed, vvherby they might the better remember the same pointes, euerie one in his place. Which instructions being, not commonly extant, and the vse of Beads also inhibited, and made dangerous to Catholikes, liuing amongst Heretikes in this age; for remedie of both these defects, a certaine Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb facs="5"/> Priest, and prisoner for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, in the tovvre of London and there also depriued both of bookes and Beades, framed for him self a forme of meditation in saying the Rosarie, by noting so many particular pointes in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of the fiftene Mysteries, that ech Mysterie seruing his owne decade, euerie <hi>Pater noster, Aue</hi> and <hi>Crede</hi> should haue their competent and particular pointes alotted. Wherby as wel the iust number of prayers, may without beades be exactly obserued, as also sufficient and apt matter be redely remembred, and the mind more eleuated to God, and idle distractions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter auoided.</p>
   <p>This priuat Exercise, albeit very vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (as not purposed for the print, but rudely writrē, and geuē to a priuat freind) yet did so content and please some wel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed persons, that presently, without knowlege of the author, they caused it to be printed, and so made common to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Wherby at last it came into the handes of one, that knew better the authors mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. who finding manie faultes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the edition, thought good to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and a mend the same, and adorning it with Images to set it forth anew, as wel to satisfie the good desires of such as first did print it, as also for the like profite to others, who either had it not, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not the vse therof before.</p>
   <p>And for al their sakes hath also added
<pb facs="6"/> hereunto, the Corone of the same most facred virgin, first instituted by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said religious father S. Dominike, or by some of his folovvers, and lately reduced into the like forme, by the same author, and novv first printed vvith the like pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. For the better vnderstanding of the name, vse, and fruite vvherof, it is to be noted, that it is called the CORONE, or Crowne of our Ladie, because it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth so manie AVES, or salutations of the B. Virgin, as she is supposed to haue liued yeares in this vvorld, before she receiued her Crovvne in heauen, vvhich are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and three. And it is diuided into seuen partes, Euerie part containing one <hi>Pater noster</hi> and tenne <hi>Aues,</hi> sauing the last, which hath one <hi>Pater noster</hi> and only three <hi>Aues,</hi> with a <hi>Crede</hi> in the end. In saying of vvhich Corone, certaine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points of the singular priuileges, vertues, and dignities of the same B. vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, grounded vpon the testimonie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he Scriptures, and auncient Fathers, are so accommodated to euerie <hi>Pater noster, Aue,</hi> and <hi>Crede,</hi> in historical order, from before her Conception vnto her most glorious Coronation, that as nere as vvel may be obserued, in the first part are proposed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se things to be meditated, that belong to the preparation made for her coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was borne. In the second, such as pertaine to her birth and education. In
<pb facs="6"/> the third, how she cooperated with the B. Trinitie, in Christs incarnation and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite. In the fourth, her participation with him, both in ioyes and afflictiōs, most part of his life in this world. In the fifth her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular compassion in the time of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and death. In the sixth, the rest of her life, with her death and assumption. And in the seuenth and last part, her most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Coronation, and exaltation aboue al Saincts and Angels, next to her sonne abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue al created persons.</p>
   <p>And because Christs Crowne and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is aboue al, here is added also an other godlie exercise called the CORONE OF OVR LORD. Which albeit in dignitie is first and chiefest, yet here it is placed in order of the time in which it was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by a certaine holie Heremite <hi>in monte Camaldulensi,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1515. alowed and priuileged with indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences by Leo the tenth, and others his successors. This Crowne consisteth of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and three <hi>Pater nosters</hi> (according to the number of yeares, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our liued in this world) and foure <hi>Aues</hi> with one <hi>Crede.</hi> And so is diuided into foure partes, ech part cōtaining tenne <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and one <hi>Aue,</hi> sauing the last which hath but three <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and one <hi>Aue,</hi> with the <hi>Crede</hi> in the end. And to
<pb facs="7"/> these prayers are likewise applied certaine Articles or points, of our Sauiours acts and sufferings, to be meditated in this order. In the first part, of his coming into this world. In the second, of his conuersation amongst men for their saluation. In the third, of his going forth of the world, by his bitter Passion and death. And in the fourth part, of his most glorious victorie and Exaltation.</p>
   <p>Finally here is also added an other briefe ROSARIE of fiftene <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> with so manie <hi>Aues,</hi> and one <hi>Crede,</hi> in memorie of seuen principal sorowes and eight ioyes of our B. Ladie. Which Rosarie who so euer saith dayly, shal in the space of a yeare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite so manie <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and <hi>Aues,</hi> as our Sauiour susteyned woundes for vs in one day, as is sayd to be reueled to S. Brigit.</p>
   <p>And thus much might suffice for this Preface, touching the contents, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of printing this litle booke, but that some may perhaps moue a doubt or two against this maner of praying, which I thought necessarie here to solue before I conclude.</p>
   <p>The first doubt is, vpon what authoritie or godlie example this numbring of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is grounded.</p>
   <p>To which I answere, That we haue for this, not only the practise of the whole Church of later time, that is, of foure or fiue hundred yeares (which is a sufficient
<pb facs="7"/> warrant to al Catholikes, for that so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal a practise of the whole Church, can not be erroneous (as S. Augustin Proueth in his exposition of the. 118. Psalme. v. 43. and very often against the Donatists) but also the confirmation of holie Scriptures, and examples of Christ him self, and of diuers Saincts euen from the primitiue Church to our time. As for example, we read in the 6. chap. of Isay, and in the 4. of the Apocalyps, that the Angels and other Saincts, ceasse not day nor night to repete continually one thing, saying: HOLIE, HOLIE, HOLIE Lord God of Hostes. Which forme of praising God. the Church militant in the self same wordes obserueth in the Canticle TE DBVM, and in the Preface of the daylie Sacrifice. Likewise the Royal prophet Dauid offered vp his holie prayers, and praises to God seuen ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes euery day, as him self testifieth in the 118. Psalme. And the whole Church of Christ doth the same, in the seuen Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical houres. Also our B. Sauiour in the garden of Gethsemani, the night before his death repeted the same prayer three ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as the Euāgelists do exactly note. And (in the 18. of S. Luke) he cōmandeth, that we continue and perseuere in prayers. Which the vulerned (especially) can not doe, but by often repeting the same pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. S. Barthlemew the Apostle, agreably to his Masters instructions, prayed euery day an hūdred times (as witnesseth Abdias)
<pb facs="8"/> The same did S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Macha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>us in Aegypt, manie yeares together (as Zozomenus recordeth lib. 6. cap. 29) And S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Paul the Heremit recited euerie day three hundred prayers (as is written in his life). For obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of which number, he put so many litle stones in his bosome and taking them forth one by one after euerie prayer, when al were so remoued, he knew thereby that his taske of prayers was accomplished. Euen as Catholike people doe now by their beades, and may do by obseruing the particular pointes of the Mysteries, set downe in this booke, and that without booke (after some diligent practise) or by anie other like meanes.</p>
   <p>An other doubt is. How this maner of praying, with meditation, vpon such My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, as are not expressed by the wordes of the prayers, may helpe attention, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the fruit of prayer, and not rather hinder the same, by leading the mind of purpose into other cogitations, different from the proper and literal sense of the wordes? For solution hereof it is to be noted, that in vocal prayer there be three sortes of attention that may be obserued, and three fruites which may be reaped (as the Angelical Doctor S. Thomas teacheth 2. 2. q. 83. a. 13.) One attention is to pronounce the wordes perfectly, and distinctly. An other is to attend to the sense of the same wordes, either literal or spiritual. The third atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="8"/> is, to remembrer the cause why we pray, or the thing we pray for, which ought euer to be the glorie of God, the saluation of our owne and other soules, or some other good thing directed thervnto. And the first effect of prayer is, to merite: the second, to obtayne that which is due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requested; and the third is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual refection of the mind. So then I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the doubt proposed: that to al the three effects it is necessarie, that we intend and purpose to haue the first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. but if afterwardes of frailrie the mind be caried away, the fruit of that prayer is not therfore lost, or frustrat, but hath his effect, by vertue of the former intention and purpose. And the same is to be said of the second attention, if one (that vnderstandeth the language, in which he prayeth) doth purpose to marke the sense of the wordes, and yet afterwards faileth to performe it. But betvvene this second, and the first attention this is the difference, that albeit this second is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, yet it is not so necessarie as the first, neither in the beginning nor in the rest of the prayer. For those that pray in a tongue they vnderstand not, can not haue this attention, and yet their prayer is profitable, and fruitful, by the vniuersal iudgement of al Doctors. The third attention, by which the mind is lifted vp to God, and good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual desires and cogitations, is not
<pb facs="9"/> only necessarie in the beginning (like as the first attention is) but also most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of al the three, to be kept stil without interruption, in respect of the third effect. And this the vulerned may also haue, pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in an vnknowne tongue. And it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so aboundeth, that the mind forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al other things; as S. Thomas, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him S. Hugo de Victore, and others do teach. And in this case it supplieth also the defects, which often happen in the other two attentions, as wel in those vocal prayers which we are bound vnto, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Church, or other obligation (so there be no notable defect in reciting the wordes) as in other prayers, which we are not bound to say. And finally this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfecteth, so much as can be in this transitorie life, the spiritual repast of the faithful soule: which attention ceassing, necessarily the refection of the mind ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with also vanisheth, but yet the other two effects do not therfore ceasse, but remaine stil. For not with standing the mind be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by humane frailtie without volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie consent, to thinke vpon base and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial things, yet the prayer may both me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite increase of grace, and obtayne the things that be asked. And much lesse is euery euagation of mind in prayer to be reputed a sinne, but that only which we either volunrarily admitte or willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, of some vaine or hurtful thing. And so you see the maner of praying proposed
<pb facs="9"/> in this booke doth not hinder due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the obiection presupposeth, but greatly helpeth the same, and bringeth also other spiritual commodities. Of which some may be here briefly noted.</p>
   <p>For first, besides that the mind is hereby directed to the best and most necessarie attention required in prayer, such also as be not so wel instructed already, may by this forme of saying the Rosaries and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones here ensuing, learne many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and most necessary points of Christian doctrine: which being once knovven, can not but moue a true Christian hart to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, more or lesse, cogitation and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so great and singular benefites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved vpon vs by Almightie God. And the more one shal meditate vpon the same, the more also shal his knovvlege be stil increased. So knovvlege and meditation do mutually helpe and increase ech other, but one vvithout the other auaileth little. For as meditation vvithout knovvlege is erroneous: so knovvlege vvithout medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is drie and fruitles. But both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvil easely inkindle the soul vvith the loue of God, and feede it with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual refection, and sturre vp and inflame the desire to al possible endeuour for the increase of Gods glorie, and health of their ovvne and other mens soules. Likevvise out of this varietie, and copie of diuine Mysteries and benefites, the vvel disposed may at al times and occasions, choose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb facs="10"/> and fit pointes to meditate vpon in al their prayers vocal or mental. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by diligent vewing and beholding the pictures here placed, euerie one may better conceiue and consider the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by them represented, and be perhaps more moued to deuotion by sight therof, then by only reading. If any therfore wil vse this exercise, no doubt but for revvard of their paines, they shal reape hereby no smal fruite and increase of pietie. You at least (my deerely beloued in our Lord Iesus Christ) vvho haue not better meanes to further your deuotions vvithal, vse this helpe. And vouchsafe of your charitie to commend al vs, (vvho to do you good haue bestovved labour and cost, in setting forth this little vvorke) amongst your other deere frendes, vnto our B. Lord, and to his B. mother our Ladie, to our propre Angels, and special Patrons, and the vvhole Court of heauen, in your svveete deuotions. Amen. 25. of March. 1590.</p>
