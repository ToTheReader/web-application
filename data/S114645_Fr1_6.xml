   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Catalogue or Series of the Chancellors of <hi>England</hi> hath beene with much care and diligence laboured by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Glover, Somerset</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld of Armes, and after him by <hi>Francis Thinne, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> Herauld; whose M. S Collections J have by me, and in them a thankfull commemoration is made of Mr. <hi>Thomas Talbots</hi> kinde assistance, hee being Clerke of the Records in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where the Charters and their Dates that afford the exactest testimonies of them are to be found for many Ages past. So that J shall not neede to cite the vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and proofes at large. Neither will I be so false to my selfe or my Reader, as to conceale that the worthy and reverend Antiquarie S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Henry Spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Knight, in his Glossary hath summarily menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned them: The nature of the Office is most accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described by him in that worke, and also by <hi>Mr.
<pb facs="6"/>
William Camden, Clarenceux</hi> King of Armes, in his History of Great Brittaine, in the description and definition of the severall Courts of Justice in this Kingdome, to which J referre those that desire to be particularly informed in that kinde. <hi>Pollidor Virgill</hi> would perswade us the Office and name of Chancellor was not known in this Kingdome till after the Norman Conquest, and the Author of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Bishops, is positive in that opinion, speaking of <hi>Swithen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> (the opinion of whose piety procured him the title of a Saint.) But the contrary is most cleere and evident as by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities hereafter mentioned will appeare, to which I referre my Reader.</p>
