   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous and friendly Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous to content many, and
not giue occasion of offence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I haue suffered the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
of som my welwillers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
so far with me, that I haue
yeelded them my consent for the
publishing of this Treatise, not
being ignorant vnto what hazard
of reproch they oppose themselues,
that permit their doings to be layde open to the view of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
For as the better sort will pronounce their oppinions of
it, answerable to the veritie of the substaunce, that shalbe in the
workes contained: so the greater sorte doe commonly giue their
verdit according to the vanitie of the surmises that shall by
them be conceaued: often kindling a kinde of mislike with the
matter, for some secrete malice that they beare to the man: And
more oftener for a resolute and setled determination that they
haue grounded in them, neuer to like well of any thing, vnlesse it
meete iumpewtth their own doting and peeuish imaginations, or
be some pigge of their proper farrowing: being in this poynt not
vnlike the crow, who alwaies thinks her owne byrdes fayrest. But
dayly examples teach vs, that they which vomitte forth the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
rancour of their malicious stomackes, against the lawda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
attemptes of others: most, are such as of themselues can doe
least: who neither cary a minde to vndertake any commendable
exercise themselues, nor haue a meaning to permit others that
would, to performe it without their venomous backbyting. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
were not odious, I woulde heere liken all such whelpes of
<hi>Zoilus,</hi> to that crabbed and canckerly naturde curre, which
being layde vpon a bottle of hey, would neither feede of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
(being meat contrary to his complection) nor suffer the poore
hungerstarued beastes to approch neere it quietly: but would lye
<pb facs="4"/>
still snapping and snarling at them. But to omitte these pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
and come to the purpose, I tell thee (gentle Reader) if
thou wilt vouchsafe the ouerlooking of this comfortable recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with a mind to profit, thou maist reape benefit, and be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bettered by the reading of it. For the brydling and keeping
vnder of our disordinate affections: for the restrayning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
of our desires within the compasse of a contented meane:
For the vse and abuse of riches, and for the gayning and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the true and perfect tranquilitie of minde, one may reade
much, and yet not finde it more pithily and substantially sette
downe, then in these Epistles following: And especially in the first,
where thou shalt meete with such plentie of sweete and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
consolations, collected out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>owelles of the scripture,
and applyed so aptly, as will mooue them, if thou haue neuer so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
tast or feeling in them of God, or godlynesse, to minde thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and be thankefull vnto him for his benefits. And my hope
is, that the goodnesse and excellencie of the matter shall so rauish
thy senses that my imperfections in the translating of them, shall
be past ouer by thee vnespied. Neuertheles if either in the edition
of this, or other my trifles, any thing shal chaunce to escape mee,
which in thy vnpartial opinion shal seeme vnfitting, I will most
willingly submit my selfe to the censure of thy iudgement, &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>monition amende the fault by repentance, yeelding thee
thankes for thy friendlinesse, answerable to the minde and good
meaning that I shal see thee to aduertise me of it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut if I shal
perceaue thee to speake it, more of malice to reprehend mee, then
of meaning to amende me, it wil so discomfort and discorage me,
and take downe myne edge in such sort, that I doubt, I shal very
hardly be brought heereafter to repose confidence againe in thy
courtesie. Yet if thou bee learned, and wilt tel me of my faults lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly,
spare not, I wil take it most thākfully: also if thou be one of
<hi>Momus</hi> mates, and dost raile at my doings spytefullie Icare not,
I will brooke it most patiently, accounting it no lesse commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to bee ill spoken of, by one that is ignoraunt and foolish, then
to be well spoken of, by one that is skilfull and wise.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
Thus we should doe, and thus (would to God) we could doe: but
as it is most easie to professe patience in words when our estate is
in quiet: so is it very difficulte to expresse it in deedes, when our
affections are distempered. Such as take mens purses from them
vndesired, passe often by the sentence of a cord, and shall such as
robbe men of their good names vndeserued, be suffered to escape
scotfree? This may be set downe for a rule that neuer fayles: that
as many men would be glad to be better thought of, then his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
shall deserue: so any man would be loth to be worse thought
of, then his doinges shall demerit. For to be defrauded of deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
prayse, and pursued with vndeserued reproch, may well bee
accounted a double iniurie. To conclude (gentle Reader) I haue
bin so charie in the choyce of the things contained in this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
that thou mayst finde many thinges heerein to delight
thee, and not any thing to dispight thee. If thou shalt
take pleasure, or gaine profit by the reading of
them: be thankfull to the authors, and
vouchsafe to thinke well of the
translator, who when he
would thee worst,
wisheth thee
well.</p>
