      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Race mercy &amp; peace frō God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christe by whose meanes wée are made of strangers frée Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizins, &amp; of the houshold of god and apointed to dwel in his kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, so that wée be not disobedient vnto his calling by his holy spirit, whiche spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a sure certain maker of our spirit, that wée bée the true begotten sonnes of God. Déerly beloued when that I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how willing▪ that the Israelites were at the making of the Tabernacle, euery man to giue part of that whiche he had (towards the building of the same) yea and such plentie came in dayly to the woorkmen, that stay was made for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in any more. And also how that in Salomons daies, euery man gaue to the building of the temple more or lesse, and now séeing it hathe pleased our <hi>Iehoas</hi> to giue commaundement to the Préests to repair the Temple at their charge. And our <hi>Darius</hi> to forbid any man to hinder the woork, but all mē to further the same: I (as a cariar of rubbishe or filling{is}) haue thought my selfe to negligent in looking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> so long, and although that my labour
<pb facs="3"/>
be small, &amp; my cunning muche lesse, yet let the frée Masons (or maister woorkmē) bear with me, and accept my good wil, be séeching them to build on as they haue be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gun, that I, and suche prentises of theirs as I am: may dayly learn at their hand{is}, at length to be iorney men, the head ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all assisting vs. I haue taken in hand to make in méeter, the chéef &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall matters in the whole Bible, keping the order of the chapters as they stand, &amp; also beginning the first▪ chapter of euery book with A. the first letter of the Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and the second B. the third C. and so to the letter U. the Alphabet to last, xx. letters, kéeping on twentie Chapters. Now if the book or part of the same be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twentie chapters: thē begin I with A. again, as for example, <hi>Genesis</hi> hath fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Chapiters, therefore because that it should not be to tedious: it is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, as the first part fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie Chapters, and so the next, then when the twentie chapiters be done, A. and so B. C. D. E. whiche are fiue letters, and there ends that part, then beginneth the next part with A. againe, and so to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then those fiue letters again, and
<pb facs="4"/>
so ends that book and fiftie chapters, but some book hath not twentie chapiters, as héer in this setting out, the book of <hi>Ruthe,</hi> then goeth the letters no further then there be chapters, as D. is the fourth let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, so hath that story but foure chapters. Know the letter and his number, &amp; then you haue the Chapiter, for the whiche I haue héer deuised how that the simple mā or other shall tel the moste of all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters notable in the Bible, vpon his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as héer after is a hand held abrode vpright, &amp; another hand closed in sauing the fore finger, which pointeth to the top of the thumbe on the left hand, where stā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth the letter A. and the number one, so holde thou out thy left hand, and point with thy fore finger of thy right hand, to the top of thy left hand thombe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there is the first letter, the first in number, and the first chapiter of eche book (vnlesse that it begin again as I tolde thée of <hi>Genesis</hi>) then though it be the first letter, yet standeth it for one &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie in number and chapters. So then to the next ioynt of the thombe and that is B▪ the second letter, the second number and chapter, then the third ioynt, is third
<pb facs="4"/>
in nomber and Chapter also, then to the top of the fore fiinger, and there is D. the fourth letter, the fourth in number, and the fourth chapter, and so as before, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that you come to the last ioynt of the litle finger, and that is the letter T. and the number ninetéen, and in the palm of the hand standeth the letter U. and that is the number twentie and chapter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, now then there is no more, but bée sure to learne what number euery ioynt is, and what letter, and then hauing the letter and the number, the chapiter is so in number, as the staffe dooth begin with all in letter, but be sure of the book in whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che the story is, that you would know, as to make you parfit, héer is examples by order of questions, thou must haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> book parfet by rote, then one asketh thée, wher is it in the book of <hi>Genesis</hi> that the Angels came &amp; lodged with <hi>Lot</hi> the night afore that <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra</hi> were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if thou be not altogither parfet, aske him whether he can say the staffe, if hée cannot, if he haue the book bid him tel thée the letter, if hée cannot neither, then thy cunning shalbe the more tried, wel this it is.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>The staffe beginneth with T. what num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber is T. that is ninetéen, say then.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Two Angels lodgd, and <hi>Sodome</hi> men,</l>
      <l>would then haue them defilde:</l>
      <l>Blind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>d they were and after stroyd,</l>
      <l>saue <hi>Lot</hi> and his vnfilde.</l>
   </q>
   <p>THe hardest example is this, where is it that <hi>Abraham</hi> charged his mā to go and fetche a wife for <hi>Isaac</hi> of his owne kinred, and how hée brought <hi>Rebecca,</hi> the chapter is the foure &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the staffe beginneth w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> D. as. Decrée did <hi>Abram</hi> to his mā. &amp;c. Now D. in the number of letters is the fourth, but then twentie Chapiters be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therfore D. in that place is four &amp; twentie, so that A.B.C.D.E. are some times one and twentie, two and twentie thrée and twentie, foure and twentie, and fiue and twentie Chapiters. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this I doo exhorte, that ye learne to say this book without the book, so shall you soon vnderstand all that I haue said, the study is good and profitable, and it once obtained, great cōmoditie shal you finde: as hearing a Preacher preache, if he say
<pb facs="5"/>
this text, this place, this story, this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and this sentence is in the scripture, if no: thou shalt knowe for the moste pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if yea: thy conscience shal be ioyned to his, his saying to be true, and also it shalbe ioyful vnto thée, to hear that place brought into thy remembrance, yea and sometime (as now, blessed be God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard) a hard place or dark speaking, or a story applyed and expounded to thy great comfort and edifiyng. And in conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuance thou shalt be able to say muche in holy writings, and to vnderstand many things necessary to be knowne for euery christian, which is my only desire, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that exercise in godlynes is muche woorth, and all scriptures of God are good for the man of God, both to be improued and also instructed, that he may be parfet (which God send my cuntrie poeple once to be) that Gods merciful hand may be al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wayes ouer vs, who euer be praysed.</p>
   <p>Note that if the book be deuided in two part{is}: then be sure of the number of chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters in the first part, and then set them to those folowing, as is shewed thée afore, as the first part of <hi>Genesis</hi> is fiue and twē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie chapters, then A. in the beginning of
<pb facs="6"/>
the second part is sixe and twentie, &amp; B. seauen and twentie, and foorth to fiue and fortie, and then A. is sixe &amp; fortie, and so to fiftie.</p>
