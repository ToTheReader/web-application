   <p>SInce the departure of the three B-ees onward into their exile, and defence against these Hornets, you haue heard (I dare say) of the fatall Auguries which haue beene blowne out of the Iesuiticall-trunke after them (to wit) how that no sooner shall they enter into <hi>Rome,</hi> but straight they shal be clapt vp into the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or sent away to the Gallies: so much (belike) they haue wrought the king of Spaines Embassadour there, to their Spanish faction against these Opponents. But God blesse them from all their hazards by the way, and then as for <hi>Rome,</hi> we make no doubt but to find it iust. The Presidents which they carrie with them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all their busines they will ingrosse at <hi>Paris</hi> of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like record, that howsoeuer their persons should happen to miscarrie by the way through Iesuiticall treacherie; yet those may serue for the next that will follow after. Neuerthelesse, Bragge is a good dog on the Iesuits side, or rather it is Iesuitisme it selfe; though much too blame to calumniate so S. <hi>Peters</hi> Bar of iniustice afore-hand. Is not this worse (I pray) then to conuerse with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
<pb n="121" facs="62"/> which is all they haue to make their maine sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of at <hi>Rome</hi> against the Appealants, for want of better matter? But giue we their illuminated father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods leaue to brag and br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ue, and depraue, as hitherto they haue done, their matter being starke naught, and whollie subsisting on such supports. Full little know they (for all their illuminations) what grounds the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifs goe on, or what cards they carrie with them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not you (good cosin) ere a whit staggard with such Iesuitisme in the meane time, though nere so big-bon'd, for (no doubt) but you shall see shame the end of it, when vpon his Holinesse hearing of the Case, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost will strike the stroke, whereby it is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that both the Appealants shalbe restored to al their honours againe, and these Droanes quite heau'd out of our English hiue, and the Seminarie-Bees confirmed therein against all both Iesuitisme and Spaine for euer after, to the infinite comfort of all true Catholicks, and namelie all true English men. God of his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes graunt it so, that no more we may behold this Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall and Iesuiticall skurfe on the sweet face of his Spouse our holie mother, but as heretofore <hi>in eius lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine videamus lumen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Master <hi>W. W.</hi> his late treatie the Iesuits perswade the vulgar and all such as dare not (through the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests inhibition) read it, that it concernes the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of all the Seminaries from the beginning, as well as of the Iesuits; namelie, that none of them haue in all this time of Persecution dyed expreslie for Religion, but all for treason: which how contrarie it is both to the whole drift, and the very letter of the booke, all readers may perceiue. See, how still they would inuolue the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
<pb n="122" facs="63"/> in their guilt, and with what sleight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence they seeke to set them still one against another: insomuch, us one or two of the Appealants partie (though not Appealants) are thereby (I beare) vpon present tearmes to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>agger. But what loafe haue ye that will not crumble? and what may such their frailtie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at those Fathers hands, then the Fox-taile flappes aforesaid. God and their good Angell therefore be their guard against so wayward humour, and make them see that in so doing, well they may marre themselues, but not the matter: and what shame it were for them to goe from whence so manie depart. To conclude then this briefe Apologie for <hi>(The Important reasons)</hi> I say no more, and so may the sincere Reader find it: then, oh slaunder, oh Iesuit; or rather no slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Iesuite.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>All this discourse is wholie submitted to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of holie Church.</hi>
