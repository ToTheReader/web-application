<pb facs="4"/>souerayne, King Edwarde the vi. who, according to the principall poynt of his regal office and charge (and according to the fotesteppes and examples of Moses, Iosua, Dauid, Salomö, Ezechias, Iosias, Iosaphat and other most godly gouernours &amp; kinges, whiche haue their perpetuall cōmendacion in the regestre of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des voke for their hartie diligence &amp; trauailes in the aduaunceing of hys pure religiō) sought chiefly the glorie of God, the honour of christ crucified, his owne edifyeng and discharge of conscience, and the instruction &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemēt of his subiectes in the true knowlage, faythe, feare and loue of God and his glorious gospel, and to buylde the churche of Englande (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of God to his Regall charge) only vpon the foundacion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and apostles, and to scowre the same from the cursed customes, and traunting tradiciōes of Satans syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinagoge. Albeit I could make a docket of remembraunce, how you of the nobilitie (that were put in autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and trust vnder the king) might &amp; ought haue answered and vsed those lecherous lieng locustes, according to
<pb facs="5"/>the ordre of iustice, bi examples bothe of diuine and prophane histories, and by the substaūcial godly lauful law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the realme, for their traitorous slādring &amp; railing vpō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lordes anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their owne naturall liege lorde, for their recaryeng of their infernall father the abiured antichrist of Rome in to Englande agayn, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of forayn powers in to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, for their false foxelye forgeing of fables (among the busye headed vulgare commones) againste theyr natural nobilitie, &amp; for theyr others to deuelishe demerites besydes: yet now seing you haue allready runne to farre, against your owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, so that it semeth almost to late for any admonicion or remēbraūce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to synke in to your hartes, being afrayde of euerye barking blaste of Antichristes bawdye beagles, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentig your selues to be ledde (like an oxe) by horne and eare, as it pleaseth thē to appoynt, til they haue brought you to blocklaye faire in to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter house, as they haue done a greate sorte of your best fedde felowes, I shal spare my pēne, &amp; with my conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nual prayers for your preseruacion
<pb facs="5"/>frō theyr clouthes, leaue you to God &amp; your selues. In the meane while, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing occasiō &amp; oportunitie, I shal sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe those wicked wormes a reasonable answer, leaste in kepyng silence and wynkyng at their licencious libertie &amp; wickednesse, we seme to be afrayde of theyr obiectiones, &amp; so make folkes beleue, they were true, or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage that the faultes, wherof they spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefulli slaūdre vs, were in vs in dede. The scripture also by the euāgelistes and apostles commaundeth and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to defende the truthe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute lyes, to beare recorde vnto the truthe, and to acquyte the faythfull christianes in theyr innocencye and ryght. But what can a man doo in so furyons a rageing rable of aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and Iniuryous entreatyng of men? Or how shold a man begynne to defende the churche, seyng such a sorte of cruell and maddebrayned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies obiecte so many and so hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crymes agaynst vs, and dyng on as it were wyth quartre strokes on euery syde? Whan. S. Paule the preacher of the Gentyles and moste chosen vessell of Chryst was accused him selfe of the Iewes, in a singular
<pb facs="6"/>good cause, euen the cause of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, furst before Antonius Felix, and eftesones before Portius Festus lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauntes of Iewrye, of many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and was more than ouerlayde wyth the power, eloquence, autoritie, and reputacion of hys aduersaries, &amp; could obteyne nother place nor space, to answere vnto euery point through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he thought he should defende hym selfe and hys cause wel ynough, yf he myght shewe by some euident &amp; most playne homely shorte reasons, that he neuer taught contrarye to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor agaynst the hope of Israel, but that he was iniuriously enuyed &amp; pressed of hys enemyes for constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preachyng and defendyng of the hope of the Resurrection, whych the Israelites holde.</p>
   <p>And now folowyng his moste godly and singular good exāple (and vsyng the helpe, ordre, and almoste the very wordes of a certayn notable profoūde learned Pastour, who hath done the same in latine, in defence and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the christen gospellike flocke &amp; churche committed to hys spiritual charge) seyng I am barred out of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and tyme (as an abiecte out of my
<pb facs="6"/>natural countrey) so that I can not possibly answere to all theyr odious obiections in ordre &amp; one by one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly by them selues, I shal yet by the helpe of God, do myn endeauour to declare and set before all mennes eyes (by the waye of translation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myne owne edicion) that whyche is moste chief and generall mater in thys cause, wyth the moste cleare and playne argumentes that I can: that is to wete, that the Churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande refourmed and gouerned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Kyng Edwarde the .vi. was no heretical, schismatical, nor sedicious Church: and that all other Churches embraceyng the Gospel in assembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wyse, are no heretical nor schisma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tical Churches, but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vndenyable chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che of Iesus Christ bothe true, fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and catholike. Wherfore I bese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you ryght honourable lordes, ryght worshipfull gentilmen, and the rest of my charytable chrysten coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, for the loue and loyaltye y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> you bare and owed to your most chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and moste louyng souerayne lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge lorde and maister Kyng Edwarde the .vi. reade or heare thys simple shorte treatyse paciently and gentlye,
<pb facs="7"/>inasmuche as I shal do my diligence as euidentlye and in as fewe wordes as I possibly can, to speake not of all thynges, that myght be alleged in thys behalfe, but suche reasons onely, as chiefly and principally concerne thys present cause.</p>
