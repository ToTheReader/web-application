   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
Reader.</head>
   <p>THE present time (Christian Reader)
both offereth these obseruations to me,
and throweth their publication from
mee: None walketh with opened eyes,
but these and the like shall occurre vnto him.
This time of the Gospel aboundeth in the meanes
of sauing knowledge, but few partake it: The
most part brutishlie neglect it; other in their
search are carried on the by: Seeking, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting,
and resting on trifling knowledge as
on happinesse; and many who in some sort
find it out, doe separate from it both affection &amp;
action, &amp; so preuailing Athesme, giueth thee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to sauing Knowledge &amp; Grace in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
But the Sun sendeth a quickening heate as
well as a shining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ight; and man is borne with
heart and hands, as well as with eyes: The
worke of light is to discouer, but affection se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth
vs from the discouered euill, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs to the knowne Good; and to walke in
the direction of that Light, and the discerning


<pb facs="5"/>
of Affection is to know sauinglie.</p>
   <p>It is the best knowledge which is about the
best things, and needeth least change at Death.
To know GOD and our happinesse in Him,
hath no change at Death, but in the degree
aduancing to perfection: As other thinges,
so other knowledge will then vanish: This is the
affectuous and actuous <hi>Knowledge according
to godlinesse,</hi> wherevnto I labour in the Lord
to stirre Thee vp. That knowing GOD in
Christ, thou may liue in Him, and walke in
Him: The sense of a God-head, is the marrow
and kernell of Christianitie: Without this
all our knowledge is but a carcase of knowledge,
&amp; wee our selues the carions of Christians:</p>
   <p>The Lord worke these good things in thee,
and thee to his Image, to fill Thee heere with
Grace, and heereafter with glorie. Amen.</p>
