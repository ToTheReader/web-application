                 <title>A Christian exhortation taken out of the Holy Scriptures : for the great comfort of euery faithfull person being in the agonie of death, before whome it must be ofte [n] times red and recited (if neede be) eue [n] to his last breath. Wherevnto is ioyned in the end a singular prayer for the partie greeuously afflicted by sicknesse dravving tovvard his death. Therewith is a briefe catechisme, which is not only to instructe the sicke, but also to refresh his memorie vvith the greate mysterie of our redemption</title>

      <hi>¶ To my Lorde, my Lord of Senarpont, Knight</hi> of

   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lorde, hauing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times considered the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the ende of mās life: I haue plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye knowen, as by an
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie experience, that men are more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and carefull for the
entertaynement and conseruation of this their life: than to prepare
themselues to a more happie ende according to God: for man being in this
bodily prison, as blinde, and not perfectlye regenerated, do the better loue
the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of suche an earthly prison, than hee doth the heauenlye
lighte: for the whiche cause it is written, that hee that is of the earthe, 
<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> speaketh of the earth. As
beeyng <pb facs="9"/>like the sonnes of Agar, whiche soughte the wisedome
of this worlde, 
<note place="margin">Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>c.
3. 2. Cor. 1. Eccles. 41.</note> the whiche is foolishnesse before God.
Howe manye bee there at this day, vnto whome the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of death is very
vnpleasaunt, yea rather detestable, so delighting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their
worldly pleasures, that they seeme to haue forgotten God, not caring any
thing at all for Religion, 
<note place="margin">Psal. 52.72.</note> nor for the vengeance and
iudgement of God, terrible and fearefull to all those which haue their names
written in the earth, being scraped out of the booke of life. VVherefore my
Lord, to the end you walke not in the large way which bringeth to destruction, 
<note place="margin">Psalme. 68. Math. 7. Eccles. 7.</note> being
taught by the wise man saying: In all thy workes, see thou doe remember
thy latter dayes, and thou shalt neuer sinne. I haue thoughte good to drawe
out of the holye Scriptures a Christian exhortation, to bee recited with a
loude voyce before euerie faithfull person, the whiche approcheth to this
bodily death (couered with a casuall life) passing on to one muche better,
and <pb facs="10"/>more happie. For hauing this done, I will attribute to my
selfe nothing, for I am but earth and durt: yet notwithstanding, I do not
thinke to haue laboured in vayne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the Lorde Iesus
Christ do the admonishe vs, 
<note place="margin">Luc. 12. Math. 24. 2. Pet. 3. 1. Thess. 5.
Psal. 2.</note> that we shoulde be alwayes readie, not knowing the houre:
for the day of the Lord wil come suddainely as a theefe in the night. O how
happie then shall they be, whiche shall put themselues into his
safegard. VVherefore my Lord, I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you this little Christian
exhortation, very humbly beseeching you to keepe the same to serue you at
youre neede, at what time it shall please the Lorde God to call you. I know
well, that when the same tyme shall come, you shall haue good meanes to
haue with you some man learned, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with holy letters, to
declare vnto you the worde of life, yet for all that, not knowing the time, nor
the place, ne yet the oportunitie that we may haue, I dare boldly say without
beast, that hearing thys exhortation redde with a loude voyce, <pb facs="10"/>being in mortall agonie, it maye be vnto you as holesome as the
Christian consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the best learned Doctor of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for
they might preach no more vnto you than the Prophets and Apostles doe preach
vnto you in the sayd exhortation; the which I beseech you to receyue, with
as good heart, as I do desire the supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour to giue you the grace
my Lorde, to glorifie him as well in your life, as in your death, and in the
meane time, that it maye please him to make you to prosper from good to
better, and to giue me to perseuere in your seruice, as your very humble
and very obedient ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant for euer: ({inverted ⁂})</p>
