      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble Princes, such is the loue which out of my souls humilitie I owe vnto your <hi>High nesses,</hi> that I may not but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb facs="3"/>of all binding dutifull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance expresse vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties, moved so to doe vpon the first ioyfull generall good newes of your Maiesties safe approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, your happie welcomming, and receiving both, (by so manie thousands of your Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,) into the Garden-plotte of <hi>Albion</hi> the citie of <hi>London,</hi> the most stately imperiall throne of your <hi>Excellencies.</hi> with whō for so much as it fared not so well with mee thē absent, to participate of their congratulating mirth, in behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thē, (which was a thing most comfortable vnto all true <hi>English</hi> harts,) of your sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and at this instant to increase the word for the increasing of our
<pb facs="3"/>ioy, of your Persons: I nowe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ranke and place, a Scholler by profession, (though the meanest amōgst ten thousād) haue thought it a matter benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to manie of the houshold of God, and not preiudicial (I hope) to anie which will be counted the friends of God, to offer this Glasse and maine point of Christianity, the verie tutchstone and seale it selfe of our profession, vnto your Graces favourable Clemencies; so much the rather I say, because we assure our selves that you are the Lords annointed, raised vp &amp; preserved by th'almighty <hi>Jehouah</hi> to sway the Scepter of this most happy Land, in having your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presēce to manage the affaires
