                 <title>A plaine path-vvay to plantations : that is, a discourse in generall, concerning the plantation of our English people in other countries. Wherein is declared, that the attempts or actions, in themselues are very good and laudable, necessary also for our country of England Doubts thereabout are answered: and some meanes are shewed, by which the same may, in better sort then hitherto, be prosecuted and effected. Written for the perswading and stirring vp of the people of this land, chiefly the poorer and common sort to affect and effect these attempts better then yet they doe. With certaine motiues for a present plantation in New-found land aboue the rest. Made in the manner of a conference, and diuided into three parts, for the more plainnesse, ease, and delight to the reader. By Richard Eburne of Hengstridge in the countie of Somerset</title>

   <head>TO THE CVRTEOVS AND Christian READERS, especially the Common-People of this Realme of ENGLAND.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ther men, diners, haue laboured seuerally in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and commending, one this Countrey, another that: as Captaine <hi>Whitbourne, New-found-Land;</hi> Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> his <hi>New-England;</hi> Master <hi>Harecourt Guiana;</hi> and some others, more then one or two, <hi>Virginia</hi> And euerie of these hath vsed sundry Motiues for the aduancement of a Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the place by him most affected; all tending to this maine end: <hi>To moue our people of England, to plant themselues abroad, and free themselues of that penurie and perill of want, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue at home.</hi> But none that I know hath handled the point in generall, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew the benefit and the good; the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the ancient and frequent vse; the facilitie and necessitie (that is indeed, if I may so speake, <hi>the Doctrine) of Plantations.</hi> That taske therefore, haue I vndertaken, which how I haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I leaue to others to iudge; requesting this at your hands <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolent and curteous Readers)</hi> that you obserue and consider: First, That I am the first that hath broken this Ice, and searched out this way; and that therefore it must needs be to me more rough and rude, then if I had passed a smooth water, and gone along in an vsuall and beaten path. Secondly, That my whole purpose and intent is, principally and specially to doe some good this way, for and with the meaner sort of our people: to whose capacitie therefore, it was fit, and more then fit, necessarie, that I should fit and frame my speech. That obserued, I doubt not but you will, not onely beare with, but also approue of my plainnesse, as best befitting my purpose to worke; and my subiect to worke vpon: the more learned and iudicious sort, I freely and ingeniously acknowledge my selfe more desirous to haue my Teachers and directours in this kind of Learning, then my Readers and Followers.</p>
   <p>If any thinke it a point beyond my Compasse, for a Diuine by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to deale with an argument of this Nature, <hi>viz. to intreat</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>of Plantations,</hi> which are commonly taken to be a matter altogether of Temporall and Secular right. Let him be pleased to know: First, That I am not alone, nor the first in this attempt, but haue for my president the precedent examples of some farre before me in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Knowledge; as Master <hi>Hackluit,</hi> who long since wrote a great Volumne of <hi>English Voiages,</hi> Master <hi>Crashaw</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> in <hi>Virginia;</hi> who haue both employed their Pens and paines for that Plantation.</p>
   <p>Secondly, That Plantations are Actions wherein we also of the Cleargie are as farre interessed as any other. They are as free for vs, as for others: and, if men will haue any hope that they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in their hands, we must haue a distinct part, a certaine share, and Cleargie-like Portion in them, as well as men of other places and qualities haue theirs. And therefore, to write and discourse of, and for them, it behoueth, and becommeth vs of the Cleargie, as well, and as much as any other.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, That one proper, and principall end of Plantations, is, or should be, the enlargement of <hi>Christs Church</hi> on Earth; and the publishing of his Gospell to the Sons of Men: and therefore in that respect, it cannot but properly and directly belong vnto them, to whom <hi>Christ</hi> hath giuen commandement and authority aboue others to take care of his Flock, to seeke the furtherance of the Gospel, and to sound forth the glad tidings of Saluation to all Nations, to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Agents therein, and speciall furtherers thereof.</p>
   <p>That my proofes and examples are most out of the <hi>Bible</hi> and Sacred Histories, I haue done it of purpose, not onely because they are with me most familiar and of best authoritie, but because they should be so with all Christians; euen the Lay sort likewise. As I am not of the Papists opinion, that is, <hi>to care little for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> so I like not to be of the Popish fashion, which is, to fill the peoples eares with sound of the Names of Fathers, Councels, and others-like, which they nor are, nor can be acquainted with but to let them heare little and see lesse the Word of God, in which they easily might, and certainly should be ripe and ready, and well both seene and read.</p>
   <p>Besides, for this present argument, it is so frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that there is not any substantiall point thereabout, for, or of the which (because the practice thereof was verie much in those
<pb facs="6"/>
times) there is not some, either precept or president to be found.</p>
   <p>If I haue any where dissented from the common practice, and shewed some dislike of the ordinarie proceedings in these Proiects, I desire but so farre to be borne with and accepted, as I bring good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, and declare or intimate some iust and reasonable cause thereof.</p>
   <p>Though I haue not presumed to set downe any certaine and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar platforme of a good and right Plantation which happely to haue done, would haue seemed in me too much either boldnesse or rashnesse: yet thus much I presume to affirme of that I haue written, that if any will read and consider it well, he may, without any great labour, collect and find out a true and good platforme of such an Action.</p>
   <p>I haue so answered many and most of the common Obiections made against and about these attempts, that out of, and by the same, an answer may likewise be shaped to any other obiection that lightly can be made there-against.</p>
   <p>The whole I haue so drawne vnto certaine heads, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rted againe into seuerall parts, as I thought might best accord with the matter haudled, and be most likely to yeeld ease and delight to the Reader.</p>
   <p>Wherein that I haue digested all into the forme of a Conference or Dialogue, hauing so many examples for it, and most of them from the best of all Ages, I am so far from fearing lest thereby I should offend any, that I presume rather, that in that point and paines aboue the rest, howsoeuer I be a little the larger, because of the Interlocution, I shall be the better accepted, my meaning and drift the sooner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and my Labours and Lines the oftner lookt vpon and perused.</p>
   <p>And now▪ that I may reuert my speech to you my countrimen and friends, you, I say, of the meaner sort, for whose sake chiefly, out of the abundance of my ardent loue and feruent desire to doe you good, I haue put my selfe to all this paines, I haue vndertaken this worke. Be pleased, I pray you, to peruse▪ that is, to reade, and cause to be read to you, ouer and ouer this booke, which I haue written to you, and for you. The Argument whereof I intreat therein, is, of <hi>Plantations,</hi> which howsoeuer attempted by many worthy, great, and honourable Personages, yet seeme little to bee accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of you, for whom, of all other, they are most necessary, and to whom properly they are intended.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>Looks vpon the miserie and want wherein you doe, and abiding in <hi>England,</hi> you cannot but liue. Looke vpon the plentie and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherein going hence, you may liue. Preferre not pouertie before riches, nor your perpetuall euill and wretchednesse, before perpetuall good &amp; happines. Now is a time wherein you may do you and yours nitie, for euer, if you will. Now God doth offer you that Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good with choice of place, to rid your selues from your present mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and distresse, which if you neglect to take, and refuse, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you doe, to make vse of and embrace, will neuer, happely can neuer be had againe.</p>
   <p>Beleeue not the idle tales and vaine speeches of such, as knowing not, and caring not to doe, either themselues or other good, perswade and tempt you to abide at home, that is, to dwell (as many of you doe) in famine and penurie, and to die in need and miserie. Harken vnto me, read, heare, and consider what I say for your better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to stirre vp and animate you to accept your good, while you may, and to stablish your Happinesse, while Opportunitie serueth. Neuer can, or shall you doe it with lesse labour and trauaile, with lesse charge and expence, with lesse perill and hurt, with lesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incombrance then now you may. My words and speeches are plaine and familiar, my reasons and arguments are strong and euident, and my answers to the vaine Obiections of the contrary minded are sound &amp; solid. Let truth take place within you, let reason moue, and let euidence of the cause sway and settle you.</p>
   <p>Bee not too much in loue with that countrie wherein you were borne, that countrie which bearing you, yet cannot breed you▪ but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and is indeed, weary of you. Shee accounts you a burthen to her, and encombrance of her. You keepe her downe, you hurt her and make her poore &amp; bare, and together with your owne, you worke and cause, by tarrying within her, her misery and decay, her ruine and vndoing. Take and reckon that for your Country where you may best liue and thriue. Straine not no more to leaue that Country wherein you cannot proue and prosper, then you doe to leaue your fathers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the parish wherein you were borne and bred vp, for fitter places and habitations.</p>
   <p>And if you will needs liue in <hi>England,</hi> imagine all that to bee <hi>England</hi> where English men, where English people, you with them, and they with you, doe dwell. (And it be the people that makes
<pb facs="7"/>
the Land English, not the Land the people.) So you may finde <hi>England,</hi> and an happy <hi>England</hi> too, where now is, as I may say, <hi>no Land,</hi> and the bounds of this Land, of <hi>England,</hi> by remouing of your selues, and others the people of this Land, to bee speedily and wonderfully remoued, enlarged and extended into those parts of the world, where once the Name of <hi>England</hi> was not heard of, and whereon the foot of an English man (till of late) had not troden.</p>
   <p>Be not so vaine-minded or weake-hearted as to thinke or beleeue that you shall doe better in this <hi>England</hi> with little or nothing, then in any other with something: here with an house and a backeside, then otherwhere with fortie or threescore, with one or two hundred acres of ground. It is the meanes and not the place that keepes and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines men well or ill. And Englishmen aboue many others are worst able to liue with a little.</p>
   <p>Know and consider, that as it is the same Sunne that shineth there, as well as here, so it is the <hi>same God,</hi> (that God in whose name you are baptized, in whose Church you haue, and doe, and shall liue, whose seruants you that remoue are, shall, and may be as well as they that remoue not) <hi>that God,</hi> I say, that ruleth and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things there as well as here. And doubt ye not, but that if you feare and serue him there, if there you keepe his commandements and walke in his wayes, as here you haue beene, and there you shall stil be taught and directed. (For the Arke of God, and the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> and seed of <hi>Leui,</hi> must and will goe ouer with you) The hand of his all-guiding Prouidence, will be stretched out vnto you, and the eye of his all-sauing mercie, no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>sse there then here will looke vpon you. For, <hi>God is nigh vnto all those that call vpon him, yea, all those that call vpon him faithfully, Psalm. 145. 38.</hi> wheresoeuer it be. Reade ouer and peruse often (<hi>good Brethren)</hi> the <hi>107. Psalm.</hi> and the <hi>139.</hi> They will teach you most plainly, plentifully and comfortably, that by Sea and Land▪ far off and neere, in one part of the world as well as in another, the Lord is at hand, <hi>(for he is Lord of all)</hi> he seeth and beholdeth all the sonnes of men, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> defendeth and prouideth for all that be his. To whose fatherly tuition, and mercifull protection, betaking and commending your selues, feare not to follow him whither soeuer he calleth, and deferre not to accept his bountifull riches and goodly gifts wheresoeuer hee presenteth and offereth them vnto you, no more then did <hi>Abraham</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
and <hi>Sara, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Iacob</hi> and many other famous, godly, and holy Patriarkes and persons, when God commanded them, to forsake their kindred and their fathers house, and <hi>to goe into that land which he should shew them:</hi> whose sonnes and daughters you shall be made, if you also walke in their steps, <hi>doing well, and not being dismaid with any feare.</hi> But of these things, I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more at large in my Booke, to the reading whereof I will now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and leaue you.</p>
