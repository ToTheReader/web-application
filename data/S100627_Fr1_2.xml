   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Vydent is yt (dere frynde in the
Lorde) vnto them which are in
the scripturs exercysed / that
our eternall God for his owne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>lye honoure created man at the first / 
and all other creaturs for mannys behoue.
This ones conceyued by fayth in Abell and
Enos / at the preachynges of Adam &amp; Seth
for the first age / prouoked the one to offre vp
sacrifice vnto hi / &amp; the other to call vpon his
most gloryouse name. In this godlye offyce
was Noe founde ryghtouse / Abraham sayth
full / Moses myghtye / Dauid holye / Helias
feruent / and manye other more in their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
zelouse for all the other ages. Farre to
longe were yt and tedyouse vnto the readers
to recyte the examples of all the fathers in
that behalfe. Iesus Christ the onlye fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of all ryghtousnesse / in all his sore trauay
le here / sought the onlye glorye of his heauē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
father / and taught the same lesson aboue
all other to be obserued of his. In the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
temptacions of sathan in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
he paciētlye answered to that was sug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gested / 
but the presumed dishonour of God
in no case coulde he suffre. The holye Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and manye other Godlye mynysters / 
haue euermore daungered their syues in the
lust quarell of the same. If we than wetyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shuld suffre him in this age to be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med / 
all these godlye exāples reiected / we
myght thereby rather apere his enemyes / 
<pb facs="2"/>
than seruauntes / his haters than louers.
This consyderacion first moued my mynde / 
after that I had seane a thre years ago / an
abhomynable Iest made vndre the tyttle of
a Genealogye of heresye / &amp; by two diuerse
prentes spred abrode amonge the people / to
dysclose the great mysterye of iniquyte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vndre
contayned / and to restore agayne the
peruerted scripturs / with the names of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Godlye menne which are oblocuted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
In this will no man that is godlye be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended / 
but thynke that I haue herin done
my bounde dewtye. Though the compylet
therof by the mercyfull Goodnesse of God
be conuerted to repentaunce (as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyblye
infourmed that he is) yet remayneth
his blasphemouse doctryne amonge the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people in a wonderfull nombre of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes.
I thought yt therfore mete / not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to destroye my labours / but for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshment
of those wycked blasphemyes to
suffre them passe at large. yet I instauntlye
desyre the readers of my boke / not to thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
anye thynge therin spoken agaynst him / 
which is now becommen Gods seruaunte / 
but agaynst that olde pestysent Papyst Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolabus
which styll yet blasphemeth Christ
and his most faythfull wytnesses. Him wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
I not haue them to space / so longe as he
dwesseth on the earthe / and that is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dygyouse
Iest or Generacyon of heresye.
Vnsemelye were yt / so manye swete scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs
<pb facs="3"/>
to remayne so depraued / and so manye
Godlye menne so slaunderouslye reported / 
the veryte in them both so spyghtfullye abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed / 
for his names sake which hath wrought
wyckedlye. Though Adam recanted his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour / 
and Dauid his wycked workinges / Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
his denyall of Christ / and Paule his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannouse
turmoylynges / yet are they not
hydden in the scripturs / but made fiyll open
to all the worlde / in re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uke and warninge
vnto vs of soche execrable euyls. Neuer y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
lesse yet those vyces so rebuked / are now vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
them no rebuke / but a syngular prayse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where as they are rehersed / beige whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
remitted in Christ. The great synne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
which is the onlye grounde of deathe
in all mē is yet euerye yeare proclamed hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye / 
amōge the Paschall ceremonyes. Whā
Christ leaneth his churche vnrebuked and
vntrobled forsynne / than rouneth she a stra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye
by manye s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>unge and vncommaunded
worshyppinges. Than reygneth she commō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
in a wycked peace / and abhominablye
playeth the whore abusynge her selfe in the
cowche of Iesabel. Apoca. 2. as of longe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
hath done the Romyshe Synagoge. And
so becommeth she no longer his chosen spou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se / 
but a reproued congregacion. Moche mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
honoure is ours / whan our synnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
by the scripturs / than whan the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turs
remayne by vs reproued and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Amonge the prophane Phylosophers &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>
Poetes / was euer the verite had in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re / 
and preferred farre aboue all fleshlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myte.
Moche more than ought it so to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
amonge vs which are of the Christē sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.
The rebukes of this boke / wayeth vpon
the matter and not the man / the spyghtfull
blasphemer &amp; not the godlye recanter. That
his fylthye vomete is proued here abhomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion
by the scripturs / to the intent that
people shuld detest it and not therwith be
poysened / can be vnto his name no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
but rather a lawde amonge them that
are godlye wyse. Verye vncomlye were it / 
that fylthynesse shuld haue fauer / and so be
