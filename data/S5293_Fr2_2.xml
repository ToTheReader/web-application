   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR asmuch as death of it selfe is fearefull, and that we cannot chuse naturally when we see it come neere vs, but we must abhorre it, and that our minds must bee then assayled with many and sundry feares, and tyred with many cares, it is good to thinke vpon it in good time, and foreseeing it, make a good prouision in our minds, of that which may comfort and strengthen vs, against all the apprehensions that either may any way trouble or disturbe them in vs. Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing is more necessarie, then to haue the word of God alwayes ready and at hand, thereby to strengthen our faith on euery side, where the diuell would either breake, or make breach therein: as wee see our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST did,
<pb facs="8"/>
who by this meanes sent backe Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, who came to present himselfe vnto him in the wildernesse to tempt him. And it is an vndoubted thing that a faith so grounded vpon such rockes as are the promises of God and Iesus Christ, who is the warranty thereof, can neuer be beaten downe, what shockes soeuer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and our other enemies can hit against it. Which is the reason that hath induced mee to write this little Treatise of the comfort of the sicke, wherein I haue brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered the passages of the Scripture which haue seemed mee most fit, to treate and deduct this matter well. If it may profit and bring any edification to the Church of God, it is all that I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or desired in the writing therof.</p>
