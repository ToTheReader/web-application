   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>THis Booke hath yet a further Reference unto thee, then what the Mother hath told: For that it concernes that High Relation also, thou standest in towards God, to whom thou owest <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> because thou callest him <hi>Father:</hi> And feare, because thou cal'st him <hi>Lord:</hi> in whom all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meet, as lines in their Center; and from whom they receive both light, motion, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For be it thou art a Governour, thou must cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Lord. Be it thou art a servant, (so is a Sonne too under age;) thou must obey in the Lord. And herein the more or lesse Idolatrous thou art, the more or lesse faulty. Now if thou shalt say, the Case is well with thee, for thou art no Idolator, my Answer is, thy heart may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, and surely doth. Indeed I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, that, if thou hast not shut thine eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the cleare light, thou art not such a Child in yeares or understanding (Be it thon art not fit for strong meat,) but that thou do'st loath and detest Idolatry in the generallity, &amp; maine tenents of the same.</p>
   <p>As first, that the Mysticall Body the Church,
<pb facs="7"/> which is least in sight, should have an Head on earth, so visible, as a Tripple Crowne will make it.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that a Supreame power should bee given to him, &amp; to others, a power so subordinate, as that they, though the Lords anoynted on earth, (I doe not read the Popes are so) should bee but fit to kisse his holinesse feete, when as an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly dog strained curtesie, and bit his toes. He, no doubt, without whose providence the least spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row falleth not, correcting such exorbitant pride by a contemptible, though serviceable Creature.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, That hee who hath his foundation in Clay, what euer, they who giue titles to men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of him, should be <hi>planted</hi> so <hi>high</hi> aboue his Predecessor <hi>Peter,</hi> (so some would haue it) as that the <hi>shot,</hi> whereby <hi>Peter</hi> was hit, cannot reach his Successour.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, That he should keepe a faire for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> and <hi>pardons, Excommunications, Bulls</hi> and <hi>Curses,</hi> and I know not what: As if he had so much interest in God, as to make him pardon man for his profit: Or as if <hi>Balak</hi> had so much power in <hi>Balaam,</hi> that hee could make him curse, where God will blesse: follow not thou the counsaile of <hi>Balaam,</hi> to mixe thy selfe with strangers, and to follow their workes, so drawing a Curse on thy selfe, and <hi>Balaam</hi> though hee bee upon his Asse, and forward on the way, shall not hurt thee.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p> Fiftly, That the constitutions of the <hi>Popes</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardinals,</hi> are of divine Authority, when as thou maist giue more credit to an old wiues tale.</p>
   <p>Sixthly, That the word, which is <hi>the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power of God vnto saluation,</hi> and is <hi>profitable to teach, to instruct,</hi> and <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> should, notwithstanding the necessity &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, be lockt vp in an vnknowne tongue, when as, besides what thou hast well obserued from <hi>Paules</hi> words, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Thou art verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that thy shepheard takes more felicity with his Dogg, then in hearing him pray or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, whose language hee understandeth not. <hi>Aug. de Ciuit. Dei lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</p>
   <p>Seuenthly, That the Virgin mother may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Sonne, whereas <hi>she rejoyceth in God hir Saviour.</hi> And that the Saints, may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated, as <hi>Intercessors,</hi> though not as <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> whereas there is but one that <hi>sitteth to make intercession for us,</hi> euen <hi>he that sitteth at the right hand of his Father.</hi> This and much more, thou callest grosse Idolatry, a <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> which may be <hi>felt,</hi> and is, by all such, as are not blinded, with ignorance, as it were by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: <hi>who professing themselues to bee wise, are become fooles,</hi> and having <hi>chang'd the truth of God into a lye, are now delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto strong delusions, even to belieue</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>lyes.</hi> And thus much, for that, I am verily perswaded of thee; my hope reacheth yet further concerning thee: That whereas thou hast so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> so often reprooued for their <hi>Fasts,</hi> their <hi>Prayers,</hi> their <hi>Almes;</hi> excellent things in themselues; thou hast thence concluded, that workes auaile nothing, unlesse they proceede from a touched and religious heart; unlesse they doe not in name only agree, but are in truth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to our profession: for that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with truth, not with ceremonie; with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, not with forme; with mercy, rather then sacrifice; with obedience, rather then the fat of Lambes; with cutting off the right eye and arme, not with casting away the baggs. And all this, considering what the Lord saith in the first of <hi>Malachi: In every place shall be offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, a pure offering; but cursed be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaver, that hath in his flocke a male, and offereth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: offer it unto the Governour: will he bee pleased with thee, or accept thy person? I am a great King, saith the Lord, and my name is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Againe (which is a consequent from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and may be for explication) whereas thou readest of dead works, and a dead Faith, which like her that liued in pleasure, haue but a name onely; thou hast thence concluded, that it is not the
<pb facs="8"/> bare doing of any thing, that brings the doer into acceptation with God: But that there is some more inward thing, that witnesseth to the worker, that he is in <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom his person is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and through whom the action is accepted. And this also, considering what <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruite of it selfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye abide in me. Ioh.</hi> 15. 4. Considering also what the Apostle saith; <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a more excellent sacrifice then</hi> Caine: <hi>But without faith it is impossible to please him.</hi> Heb. 11. 2. &amp; 6. which consideration, if it hath put thee upon the pursuit after faith, wherby thou art fastned to <hi>Christ</hi> as closse as the <hi>branch</hi> to the <hi>Vine;</hi> It is impossible thy workes should be dead.</p>
   <p>Againe (which is still for explication) whereas thou hast read in one place a plaine reproofe for <hi>holding downe the head like a Bullrush;</hi> and in another, a plaine command: <hi>But thou when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</hi> that is, seeme least, when thou do'st most; thou hast thence concluded, that God is pleased with sinceritie of life and manners, not with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall seuere seeming habit; With a broken and contrite heart; not with strange expressions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, set forth in a poore and austere life of many orders amongst the Priests in their sundry acts of penance, wherein they deale with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>Bedlam-like;</hi> or like <hi>Baals Preists.</hi> And this, considering God saith, <hi>rent your hearts, and not your garments;</hi> I add for explication, nor your skins neither, the skinne is the outward garment of the soule: As they might not vnder the Law, so may not we under the Gospell, disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure our selues in mourning. <hi>Zachariah</hi> foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the mourning that shall be by those one whom the power of <hi>grace and supplications</hi> is pour'd, expressed it by two liuely comparisons; their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning shall be like his, whose <hi>coale</hi> is <hi>put out, who hath lost his onely sonne:</hi> It shall be like that mourning, which was for good <hi>Iosiah:</hi> that was an extreame mourning. Now how should this be performed? The experience of <hi>Sions</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can tell you this, for there is the same spirit in them, as in the text. <hi>They shall mourne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very familie apart, and their wives apart.</hi> I know outward expressions of this sorrow, may be, nay are, and will be; it is hard to bite in that sorrow, nor is it expedient: yet the direction must be followed; <hi>but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head. Matth.</hi> 6. For close hereof, I adde this. The outward gesture hath then a comely posture, when a touched heart commands it. An hearty sorrow is seene in the face. It is true: <hi>Deprendas animi tormenta, deprendas et gaudia: sumit utrum{que} inde habitum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> The inwardnesse of the griefe, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="9"/> expression of the same even in sight, may be as neare as <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in their race, but still the first is more intense, more lasting; it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runnes the second.</p>
   <p>Againe, and lastly, when thou art commanded to beware in giuing <hi>almes,</hi> that thou be not thine owne trumpet: Corrupt nature is much pleased with that musicke: And that upon thy prayers thou must <hi>shut the doores;</hi> that is, do all in <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> before him, who <hi>sees in secret, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards openly:</hi> thou hast thence concluded, that it is most ordinary for a man truly religious, to doe the workes of a syncere Christian, and yet not to be seene or marked, for feare of applause from others, and ticklings from his owne heart, which he would not haue to be his reward; and therefore would not giue the least advantage that way. And then, as thou wilt not disalow publicke acts of charity, or rashly iudge their miscarriage (for who art thou, that darest iudge anothers worke outwardly good, though, through the frailty of humane nature, there is great hazard of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage) so nor darest thou consure a man for his not so frequent working, or not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at all to thy knowledge: And this, for that the proper seat of Religion is the <hi>heart,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede alwayes setts the hand, and mouth on worke, opening both, but yet most times so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the left hand cannot know what the right
<pb facs="10"/> hand doth. By this thou perceiuest what a faire hope is conceiued of thee. First I will tell thee why; then thou shalt know also, that thou art not yet quitted from Idolatry. Why? <hi>The Lord hath given his word unto Iacob, and his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to Israell. Hee hath not dealt so with other nations, nor haue the Heathen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his law. The word of God, the will of God, the law of God, the testimonies of God, David</hi> calls them his <hi>counsellers</hi> also: hee saw wonders in them, they made him <hi>wiser then the auncient, then his teachers.</hi> This <hi>word of God</hi> I say, is set before thee, mauger the malice of Divell, and Pope, translated into thy mother tongue: It is, notwithstanding the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of such a iewell, the loathing of such <hi>Manna,</hi> rained downe round about thy <hi>tents:</hi> nor so only, it is committed unto thee at this day; if thou wilt reach forth thine hand, thou may'st open it; if thou wilt open thine eyes, thou may'st reade it: It is a <hi>sealed book</hi> indeed, but to none, but such, whose contempt hath closed the eye, who haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iustruction: So then, God is not wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and I hope that thou hast not beene wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to thy selfe, thou hast not <hi>neglected so great salvation.</hi> There is the reason of my hope, that thou hast seene by this cleare light, and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too, that the senses of some Papists are stupid, and their ignorance monstrous, and thou hast
<pb facs="10"/> prayed for them: <hi>Lord lighten their eyes, els they sleepe in death:</hi> Now looke home: search thine owne tent, turne up the furniture too; for thy heart will keepe hir I dolls as closse as <hi>Rachell</hi> did, when thou maist thinke thy selfe as cleare of them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> his tents. For surely thou maist be confident herein; that since every sinne is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a kind of Idolatry, this sinne of Idolatry is not poured out of thy heart, as <hi>water</hi> out of a bottle, but as <hi>milke:</hi> therefore is there a great tincture left behind. And certainely thou maist say of this sinne, as the Apostle concerning death; <hi>the last enemie that shall bee destroyed is death:</hi> So the last sinne that shall be destroyed in thy heart shall bee Idolatry: I meane, the Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the creature, something wrought by thee, or something wrought in thee: It being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>pitch,</hi> and upmost <hi>peg</hi> in Christianity: (Yet so <hi>high</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st thou bee <hi>wound,</hi> notwithstanding thy waight pressing downe) to come before the Lord with the <hi>Syrians</hi> protestation. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. And then to say in his and <hi>Davids</hi> acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is the same; <hi>of thine owne hand haue I given backe unto thee, for who hath first given to the Lord?</hi> And with <hi>Paul, yet not I, but the grace of God which is in me:</hi> And with the Church, <hi>the Lord hath given me do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the strong; Iudg.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>The Lord hath wrought all my workes for me:</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/> and so to hang on God as the finisher and perfecter of what he hath begun, yet in an assured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this very thing, <hi>that hee, who hath begun a good worke, will performe it til the day of Iesus Christ: Phil.</hi> 1. 6. I know, I haue transgressed the bounds of an Epistle, which must not <hi>fill the hand,</hi> I know not also, whether the gate &amp; the house are proportionable: I mean, the Epistle &amp; the Booke: I am sure they are both to big. Let not that trouble thee, it was neither thy labour nor thy cost, why should'st thou complaine? It falls out in matters of this nature, as in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: this roome is not light enough, nor is that large enough, the third would have some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: by that time all is done, the paines cost and building farre exceedes the Idea or first propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so here: It is true, he that would say all, must needes say too much, yet I beseech thee spare thy Censure this once, I will never venture it againe; nor had I now unlesse there had beene a cause, <hi>what have I now done? is there not a cause?</hi> I leave thee now to the power of his Grace, <hi>who can build further;</hi> we have a barren mould, though the Lord hath had long patience, how soone hee will come to require fruit, wee know not: Pray, we, that hee would husband us yet one yeare by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants &amp; give unto us the <hi>springs of water, the upper and the nether springs, then cause his winds to blow upon it,</hi> so shall we have a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="11"/> portion. Pray wee, <hi>that hee would open our mouthes wide, &amp; then fill them as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fàtnes,</hi> so shall wee fare well.</p>
