      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause this Treatise chiefly concerneth the dyet of our English nation, I have thought good, (most gentle Reader) first to declare the situation and temperature of this our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>England,</hi> and next to set downe the reason and order of the whole booke. Touching the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we consider the division of the whole earth habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into foure parts, that is, <hi>Europe, Africke, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> then is <hi>England</hi> a parcell of <hi>Europe,</hi> and situated on the West side thereof, yea, so farre West, as of old time it hath beene thought, (<hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> witnessing the same in the life of <hi>Iulius Agricola</hi>) that beyond <hi>England</hi> dwelled no Nation, <hi>Nihil nisi fluctus &amp; saxa.</hi> And as the Poet <hi>Horace</hi> speaketh, <hi>ultimos orbis Britannos.</hi> Whereas now through the providence of God, and travaile of men there is found further in the West, as it were a new world, a goodly countrey named <hi>America,</hi> or new <hi>India,</hi> for largenesse, plenty, wholesome and temperate ayer, comparable with <hi>Affrike, Europe,</hi> or <hi>Asia.</hi> Againe, if we respect the division of all the earth into five parts called in Latine <hi>Zonae,</hi> corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to the division of the heavens by five circles, that is to say, the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> circle, the two <hi>Tropickes,</hi> the one of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the other of <hi>Capricornus,</hi> the circle <hi>Articke,</hi> and the contrary <hi>Antarticke,</hi> which are briefely and plainely set forth by the Poet <hi>Ovid</hi> in the first booke of his <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi> in this manner:
<q>
         <l>Vt{que} duae dextra coelum, totidem{que} sinistra</l>
         <l>Parte secant Zona: quinta est ardentior illis:</l>
         <l>Sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem</l>
         <l>Cura Dei, totidem{que} plagae tellure premuntur.</l>
         <l>Quarum qua media est non est habitabilis aestu.</l>

   <p>Then I say of five parts of the earth, those two which lye about the Poles, within the circle <hi>Articus</hi> and <hi>Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> through extremity of cold, are inhabitable: (as of old time hath beene thought,) howbeit now certaine Ilands are discovered within the circle <hi>Articke,</hi> and found
<pb facs="7"/>
to be inhabited. The third and greatest part which lyeth in the middes betweene the two <hi>Tropickes,</hi> by reason of the continuall course of the Sunne over it, and the direct casting of the Sunne beames upon it, named <hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> as burned or parched with overmuch heat, hath likewise beene thought inhabitable, yet now found otherwise: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the greatest part of <hi>Africk</hi> well inhabited, and no small portion of <hi>Asia,</hi> with sundry Ilands adjoyning doe lye within this compasse, yet by the judgement of <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> a man very expert in Cosmography, right under the Equinoctiall is most temperate and pleasant habitation: for so he sayth: <hi>Torrida inprimis quanquam assidua Solis irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatione arescere videatur,</hi>

         </gap>icorne,</hi> are counted temperate and habitable regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because they are tempered with heate on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and cold on the Northside. Howbeit these parts also about the middest of them are most temperate. For toward their utmost bounds they are distempered with heate or cold according to the <hi>Zones</hi> next adjoyned. Now in the temperate <hi>Zone</hi> Northward lyeth our countrey of <hi>Brittaine.</hi> After <hi>Appianus, England</hi> within the eight <hi>Clime</hi> called <hi>Dia Ripheon,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in the ninth called <hi>Dia Darvas,</hi> or after <hi>Orontius,</hi> whose judgement I rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>England</hi> in the ninth <hi>Clyme,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: for the old division of the earth, according to the latitude into seven <hi>Climates, Orontius</hi> utterly rejecteth, and thinketh the famous universitie and City of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to be placed about the end of the eight <hi>Clime,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the latitude of the earth, or elevation of the pole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke</hi> (for both are one in effect) is there 48 degrees; and 40 minutes. The same reason doe I make for <hi>England,</hi> because the pole <hi>Articke</hi> is exalted at <hi>London</hi> 51 degrees and 46 minutes, and at <hi>Oxford</hi> 51 degrees and 50 minutes, that therefore <hi>England</hi> should bee the ninth <hi>Clime,</hi> because the distance of parallels from the <hi>Equator</hi> is after <hi>Orontius</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
in the ninth <hi>Clinie,</hi> all one with our elevation. <hi>England</hi> then lyeth in the temperate <hi>Zone</hi> Northward, and the ninth <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> having on the South-East side <hi>France,</hi> on the North-East, <hi>Norwey,</hi> on the South-West <hi>Spaine,</hi> on the West <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the North <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now concerning the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ayre in <hi>England,</hi> whether it bee in a meane, or doe exceed the meane, in heat, cold, dryth or moysture, shall best bee perceived by comparison of other countries. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in the end of his third booke of <hi>Prenotions,</hi> setteth downe three Countries for example of temperate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate aire in heate or cold, that is <hi>Libya, Delos</hi> and <hi>Scythia, Libya</hi> or <hi>Affricke</hi>▪ as over hot, <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartaria</hi> as over cold, and the Iland <hi>Delos</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> as meane &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate betwixt both. The like comparison is made of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in the 7. booke and 7. Chapter of his Politikes. Those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (saith he) which inhabite cold countries, are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, but they have little wit and cunning. Wherefore they live in more libertie, and hardly receive good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of the weale publike, neither can they well rule their borderers. And such as dwell in <hi>Asia,</hi> excell in wit and art, but they want audacitie, for which cause they live in subjection to others. But the Graecians as they have a Countrey in a meane betweene both, so have they both qualities. For they are both valiant and witty. Whereby it commeth to passe that they live at liberty, and have good government, and such a state as may rule all other. Hereunto I will adde the judgement of <hi>Galen</hi> that famous Physitian, written in the second booke <hi>de San. tu.</hi> and 7. Chapter, which may be as an interpretation of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> The best temperature of body (saith hee) is as a rule of <hi>Polycletus,</hi> such as in our situation being very temperate, you may see many. But in <hi>France, Scythia, Egypt</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> a man may not so much as dreame of any like. And of our Countrey which hath no small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that part which lieth in the middest is most tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the Countrey of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> for that there VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; Summer hath a meane temperature, and at the Spring and fall of the leafe much better. So that Greece by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these men is most temperate, and <hi>France</hi> distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<pb facs="8"/>
with cold by the opinion of <hi>Galen.</hi> And if <hi>France</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the meane in cold, then is not <hi>England</hi> in a perfect temperature, but more declining to cold, because it is three degrees and ten minutes farther North, comparing <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> together in the elevation of the Pole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Howbeit <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in the fift book of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, thinketh the ayre to bee more temperate in <hi>Britaine,</hi> (in those places where he was) than in <hi>France,</hi> and the cold lesser. And <hi>Polidorus Virgilius</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>England</hi> seemeth to bee of the same minde. The countrey (saith he) is at all times of the yeare most temperate, and no extremitie of weather, so that diseases be rare, and therefore lesse use of Physick than elsewhere. And many men all abroad doe live a hundred and ten years, and some a hundred and twenty, yet he thinketh the aire for the most part to be cloudy and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which also is confirmed by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> saying: The ayre of Brittain is foule with often stormes and clouds, without extremitie of cold. But to reconcile these sayings of ancient authors, I thinke that <hi>England</hi> may bee called temperate in heate in respect of Spaine, and temperate in cold in respect of <hi>Norwey,</hi> yet to be reckoned cold notwithstanding &amp; moist, because it declineth from the mids of the temperate Zone Northward. And this is the cause why Englishmen doe eate more, and digest faster than the inhabitants of hotter countries (<hi>videlicet</hi>) the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of aire enclosing our bodies about. And therefore wee provide that our tables may be more plentifully furnished oftentimes, than theirs of other nations. Which provision, though it proceed chiefly of that plenty which our country yeeldeth, is yet notwithstanding noted by forraine nations, as of <hi>Hadrianus Barlandus</hi> in a dialogue between the Inhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the traveller, saying in this manner: <hi>Ego curavero ut Anglice, hoc est opulentissime pariter ac lautissime discumbant.</hi> Thus much touching the situation &amp; temperature of <hi>Englād.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now concerning the order of the booke: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the sixt booke of his <hi>Epidemies</hi> setteth downe this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Labor, Cibus, Potio, Somnus, Venus, omnia mediocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi>: as a short summe or forme of a mans whole life touching diet. By the which words (if we marke them well as they
<pb facs="8"/>
be placed in order) not onely the time most convenient for every thing to bee used, but also the measure in using is plainely signified in the word (<hi>Mediocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi>) according to that saying of Terence, <hi>Id apprime in vita esse vtile, ut ni quid nimis.</hi> Every man therefore that hath a care of his health as much as hee may, must not onely use a measure in those five things, that is to say, in labour, meate, drinke, sleepe, and venus, but also must use them in such order as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath proposed them, that is, to beginne the preservation of health with labour, after labour to take meat, after meat, drinke: after both sleepe: and venus last of all. And not contrariwise, using <hi>Hysteron Proteron,</hi> to begin with venus, and to end in labour, like as I have heard say of a gentleman who had beene a traveller in forraine countryes, and at his returne, that he might seeme singular, as it were despising the old order of England, would not begin his meale with pottage, but instead of cheese would eate pottage last. But wise English men I trust will use the old English fashion still: and follow the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>le of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> approved by <hi>Galen,</hi> and by common experience in mens bodies found most wholesome. Such as have written of the preservation of health before mee, for the most part have followed the division of <hi>Galen</hi> of things not naturall, which be six in number: Ayre, Meat, and Drinke, Sleepe and watch, Labour and rest, Emptinesse and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and affections of the minde. Which bee called things not naturall, because they bee no portion of a naturall body, as they bee which bee called naturall things, but yet by the temperance of them the body being in health, so continueth by the distemperance of them, sickenesse is induced, and the body dissolved. This division Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Eliot</hi> knight, no lesse learned than worshipfull, in his Castle of Health hath precisely followed, and hath set forth every part right according to <hi>Galen,</hi> as plaine as may bee, in the English tongue. Yet (in my iudgement) this Aphorisme of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which I purpose (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to declare, is more evident for the common capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, and more convenient for the dyet of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Nation. For who is so dull of understanding that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="9"/>
remember these five words, <hi>Labor, Cibus, Potio, Somnus, Venus,</hi> and in using them apply <hi>Omnia Mediocria.</hi> Yet I know that the division aforesaid being well scanned may be found in a manner wholly comprehended in this short sentence. For exercise is to be used in an wholesome ayre, and affections of the mind do commonly follow the temperature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is chiefely preserved by the moderate use of those five things. Then whether we follow in dyet <hi>Galens</hi> divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into six things not naturall, or this rule of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> comprehended in five words, there is no great difference, saving that in writing for the instruction of others, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode is to used which is most briefe and manifest. And this is the cause gentle Reader, why I have taken another order than such as have written of this matter before me, even that order (as I thinke) which of all other is the best: Herein to give a watch word as it were, or occasion to others that be better learned and more at leasure to handle these points more perfectly. And in the meane time I trust every well disposed person will thankfully accept this my good intent, considering that none other cause hath moved mee hereto but onely the good will I beare first to the learned sort, who have most need of wholesome counsayles, and consequently to all those that loue to live in health. And as the words are placed in order, so shall in order prosecute them. Yet one thing I desire of all them that shall reade this booke: If they finde whole sentences taken out of Master <hi>Eliot</hi> his Castle of Health, or out of <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> or any other author what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that they will not condemne me of vaine glory, by the old Proverbe (<hi>Calvus Comatus</hi>) as if I meant to set forth for mine owne workes that which other men have devised: for I confesse that I have taken <hi>Verbatim</hi> out of others wher it served for my purpose, and especially out of <hi>Schola Salerni</hi>: but I have so enterlaced it with mine owne, that (as I think) it may be the better perceived. And therefore seeing all my travaile tendeth to common commodity, I trust every man man will interpret all to the best. <hi>Candide lector, etiam atque etiam vale.</hi>
