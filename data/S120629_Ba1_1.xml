      <l>SEldome doe Clowdes so dimne the day,</l>
      <l>But <hi>Sol</hi> will once his Beames display:</l>
      <l>Though <hi>Neptune</hi> driues the surging Seas,</l>
      <l>Sometimes he giues them quiet ease;</l>
      <l>And so few Proiects speed so ill,</l>
      <l>But somewhat chaunceth at our will.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I will not instance in the Great,</l>
      <l>Placed in Honors higher Seate;</l>
      <l>Though Vertue in a Noble Line</l>

         </gap>, and the more doth shine:</l>
      <l>Yet this is procu'd by Sword and Pen,</l>
      <l>Desert oft dwells in priuate Men.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>My proofe is not farre hence to seeke,</l>
      <l>There is at hand braue <hi>Richard Peeke,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Whose worth his Foes cannot reuoke,</l>
      <l>Borne in the Towne of <hi>Tauystoke</hi>
      </l>
      <l>In <hi>Deuon,</hi> where <hi>Minerua</hi> sitts</l>
      <l>Shaping stoute Hearts, and pregnant Witts.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="18"/>
      <l>This well resolu'd and hardy Sparke,</l>
      <l>Ayming at Fame, as at a Marke,</l>
      <l>Was not compell'd against his will,</l>
      <l>In <hi>Mars</hi> his field to try his skill:</l>
      <l>As Voluntary he did goe,</l>
      <l>To serue his King against his Foe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If he had pleas'd, he might haue spent</l>
      <l>His daies at home, in safe content:</l>
      <l>But nurcing Valour in his brest,</l>
      <l>He would aduenture with the Best,</l>
      <l>Willing to shed his dearest blood,</l>
      <l>To doe his Prince, and Countrey good.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus bent, he adding Winges to Feete,</l>
      <l>Departed with the <hi>English</hi> Fleete:</l>
      <l>There was no rub, nor stay at all,</l>
      <l>The Shipps saild with a pleasant Gale:</l>
      <l>In setting forth they by their hap,</l>
      <l>Seem'd lul'd in <hi>Amphitrites</hi> lap.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>At length they did arriue at <hi>Cales,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Where restles <hi>Peeke</hi> against the Walles</l>
      <l>Made fouresccore Shot towards the Shore,</l>
      <l>Making the Welkyn wide to rore:</l>
      <l>He kept his standing in this strife,</l>
      <l>Setting a straw by losse of life.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Into a Vineyard afterward</l>
      <l>He marcht, and stood vpon his guard;</l>
      <l>There he an Horse-man did dismount,</l>
      <l>By outward port of good account:</l>
      <l>But did on him compassion take,</l>
      <l>And spar'd his life for pitties sake.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="18"/>
      <l>The next assault, vneuen he felt,</l>
      <l>For with twelue <hi>Spaniards</hi> he dealt</l>
      <l>At once, and held them lusty play,</l>
      <l>Vntill through odds, theirs was the day:</l>
      <l>From eare to eare they pearc'd his head,</l>
      <l>And to the Towne him Captiue led.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In Prison they him shut by night,</l>
      <l>Loaden with Chaines of greiuous waight,</l>
      <l>All comfortlesse in Dungion deepe,</l>
      <l>Where Stench annoyes, and Vermines creepe:</l>
      <l>He grouel'd in this loathsome Cell,</l>
      <l>Where gastly frights and horrors dwell.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yet nothing could his courage quaile,</l>
      <l>Hunger, nor thirst, nor wound, nor Iayle:</l>
      <l>For being brought before a <hi>Don,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And askt, Why <hi>England</hi> did set on</l>
      <l>A scraping, not a pecking <hi>Hen?</hi>
      </l>
      <l>He answer'd, staine not <hi>English-men.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>That <hi>England</hi> is a Nation stoute,</l>
      <l>And till the last will fight it out:</l>
      <l>My selfe could prooue by Chiualrie,</l>
      <l>If for a Captiue this were free:</l>
      <l>Why, (quoth the Duke) darst thou to fight</l>
      <l>With any of my Men in fight?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Of thousands whom in Warre you vse,</l>
      <l>Not one (quoth <hi>Peeke</hi>) doe I refuse:</l>
      <l>A chosen Champion then there came,</l>
      <l>Whose heeles he tript, as at a game,</l>
      <l>And from his Hand his Rapier tooke,</l>
      <l>Presenting it vnto the Duke.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="19"/>
      <l>Then three at once did him oppose,</l>
      <l>They Rapiers, he a long Staffe chose,</l>
      <l>The vse whereof so well he knowes,</l>
      <l>He conquerd them with nimble blowes:</l>
      <l>One that beside him playd his round,</l>
      <l>He threw as dead vnto the ground.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Noble Duke who this did see,</l>
      <l>Commended <hi>Peeke,</hi> and set him free;</l>
      <l>He gaue him Guifts, and did commaund</l>
      <l>That none should wrong him in their Land;</l>
      <l>So well he did him entertayne,</l>
      <l>And sent him to the Court of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>There he was fed with no worse meate,</l>
      <l>Then which the King himselfe did eate;</l>
      <l>His Lodging rich, for he did lie</l>
      <l>In furniture of Tapestrie:</l>
      <l>The King what of him he had heard,</l>
      <l>Did with his Treasure well reward.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Our then Ambassador was there,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Peekes</hi> Pike and praise he doth declare:</l>
      <l>At <hi>Spanish</hi> Court whiles he attends,</l>
      <l>He thriues for Vertues sake: as Friends</l>
      <l>Foes sent him in triumphant sort</l>
      <l>Home from a Foe and Forreigne Port.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If thus his very Foes him lou'd,</l>
      <l>And Deeds against themselues aproou'd;</l>
      <l>How should his Friends his loue embrace,</l>
      <l>And yeild him countenance and grace?</l>
      <l>The praise and worth how can we cloke</l>
      <l>Of manly <hi>Peeke</hi> of <hi>Tauystoke?</hi>
