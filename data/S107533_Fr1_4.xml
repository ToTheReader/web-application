   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Haritable Reader, it is one of the golden sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, whiche Christ our Sauiour vttered to his Apostles,
<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> that there <hi>is nothing so coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that shall not be reuealed, neither so hid, that shall not be knowne: and whatsoeuer they haue spoken in darkenesse, should be heard in the light: and that whiche they had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the eare in secret place, should be publiklie preached on the tops of the houses.</hi> And since he hath said it, moste true must it be, since the authour thereof is the fountaine and very beeing of trueth. Whiche should moue all godlie and honest men, to be very warie in all their secretest actions, and what so-euer middesses they vse for attayning to their moste wished endes: least otherwayes howe avowable soeuer the marke be, where at
<pb facs="9"/>they aime, the middesses being discouered to be shamefull, whereby they climbe; it may turne to the disgrace both of the good worke it selfe, and of the authour thereof: since the deepest of our secrets, can not be hid from that al-seeing eye, and penetrant light, pearcing through the bowels of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie darkenesse it selfe.</p>
   <p>But as this is generallie true in the actions of all men, so is it more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie true in the affaires of Kings. For Kings being publike persons, by reason of their office and authoritie, are as it were set (as it was saide of olde) vpon a publicke stage, in the sight of all the people; where all the beholders eyes are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuelie bent, to look and pry in the least circumstance of their secreatest driftes. Which should make Kings the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not to harbour the secretest thought in their minde, but suche as in the owne time they shall not be ashamed openlie to avouche: assuring them selues that time the mother of verity, will in the dewe sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son bring her owne daughter to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
   <p>The true practise heer-of, I haue as a
<pb facs="9"/>King, oft found in my owne person; thogh I thanke God, neuer to my shame: hauing laide my count, euer to walke as in the eyes of the Almightie, examining euer so the secretest of my dristes, before I gaue them course, as howe they might some day byde the touchestone of a publike tryall. And amongst the rest of my secret actiōs, whiche haue (vnlooked for of me) come to publick knowledge, it hath so fared with my <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, directed to my eldest sonne; whiche I wrote for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of my owne ingyne, and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, who is appointed by God (I hope) to sit on my Throne after me. For the purpose and mater thereof being only fit for a King, as teaching him his office; and the person who me-for it was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a Kings heire, whose secret counsellor and faithfull admonisher it must be; I thought it no waies conuenient, nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that either it should to all be proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whiche to one onely appertained (&amp; specially being a messinger betwixt two so coniunct persons) or yet that the moulde, whereupon he should frame his future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, when he comes both vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb facs="10"/>of his yeares, and possession of his inheritance, should before the hande, be made common to the people, the subiect of his future happie gouernment. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the more secret, and close-keeping of them, I onely permitted seauen of them to be printed, the printer being first sworn for secrecie: and these seauen I dispersed amongst some of my trustiest seruands, to be keeped closelie by them: least in-case by the iniquitie, or wearing of time, any of them might haue bene loste, yet some of them might haue remained after me, as witnesses to my Sonne, both of the honest integritie of my hart, and of my fatherlie affection and naturall care towards him. But since contrarie to my intention and exspectation, as I haue alreadie said, this booke is nowe vented, and set forth to the publicke viewe of the worlde, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, subiect to euery mans censure, as the current of his affection leades him; I am nowe forced, aswell for resisting to the malice of the children of enuy, who like waspes, suckes venome out of euery whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some hearbe; as for the satisfaction of the godly honest sorte, in any thing that they
<pb facs="10"/>may mistake therein; both to publishe and spred the true copies thereof, for defacing of the false copies that are alreadie spred, as I am enformed: as likewayes, by this preface, to cleare suche parts thereof, as in respect of the concised shortnesse of my style, may be mis-interpreted therein.</p>
   <p>To come then particularlie to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my book, there are two speciall great points, whiche (as I am informed) the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious sorte of men haue detracted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and some of the honest sorte haue see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a little to mistake: whereof the firste and greatest is, that some sentences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in should seeme to furnishe groundes to men, to doubt of my sinceritie in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whiche I haue euer constantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: the other is, that in some partes thereof, I should seeme to nourishe in my minde, a vindictiue resolution against England, or at the least, some principalles there, for the Queene my mothers quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
   <p>The first calumnie (moste greeuous in-deede) is grounded vpon the sharp &amp; bitter wordes, that therin are vsed in the description of the humours of Puritans,
<pb facs="11"/>and rashe-headie preachers, that thinke it their honour to contend with Kings, &amp; perturbe whole kingdomes. The other point is onely grounded vpon the straite charge I giue my Sonne, not to heare, nor suffer any vnreuerent speaches or bookes against any of his parents or progenitors: wherein I doe alledge my owne experience anent the Queene my mother: affirming that I neuer founde any, that were of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite age the time of her raigne here, so sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly true to me in al my troubles, as these that constantly kept their alleageance to her in her time. But if the charitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will aduisedlie consider, both the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode and mater of my treatise, he will easilie iudge, what wrong I haue sustained by the carping at both. For my booke, suppose very small, being deuyded in three seuerall parts; the first part thereof onely treates of a Kings duetie towards God in Religion: wherein I haue so clearlie made profession of my Religion, calling it the Religion: wherein I was brought vp, and euer made profession of, and wishing him euer to continue in the same, as the onely true forme of Gods worship; that I would
<pb facs="11"/>haue thought my sinceare plainnesse in that first part vpon that subiect, shoulde haue ditted the mouth of the most enuious <hi>Momus,</hi> that euer hell did hatche, from barking at any other part of my booke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that grounde; except they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me to be contrary to my selfe, whiche in so small a volume, would smell of too great weaknesse, and sliprinesse of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And the second part of my booke, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches my sonne howe to vse his office, in the administration of iustice, and politicke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: the third onely contayning a Kings outwarde behauiour in indifferent things; what aggreeance and conformitie he ought to keepe betwixt his outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in these things, and the vertuous qualities of his minde: &amp; howe they should serue for trunshe-men, to interprete the inwarde disposition of the minde, to the eyes of them that cannot see farther with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and therefore must onely iudge of him by the outward appearance. So as if there were no more to be looked into, but the very methode and order of the booke, it will sufficient lie cleare me of that firste &amp; greeuousest imputation, in the point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb facs="12"/>since in the first part, where Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely treated of, I speake so plainelie. And what in other parts I speake of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, it is onely of their morall faultes, in that part where I speake of policie: decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring when they contemne the lawe and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie, what examplare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment they deserue for the same. And nowe as to the mater it selfe where-vpon this skandale is taken, that I may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently satisfie all honest men, and by aiust apologie raise-vp a brasen wall or bulwark against all the dairts of the enuious, I will the more narrowlie rype-vp the wordes, whereat they seeme to be some-what sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macked.</p>
   <p>First then, as to the name of Puritanes, I am not ignorant that the stile thereof doth properly belong only to that vile sect amongst the Anabaptistes, called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of loue; because they thinke them selues onely pure, and in a manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, the onely true churche, and only worthie to be participant of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and all the rest of the worlde to be but abhomination in the sight of God. Of this speciall sect I principallie meane, when
<pb facs="12"/>I speake of Puritanes; diuerse of them, as <hi>Browne, Penrie,</hi> and others, hauing at sundrie times come in Scotland, to sowe their popple amongst vs (and from my hart I wishe, that they had left no schollers behinde them, who by their fruites will in the owne time be manifested) and partly, indeede, I giue this style to suche bransicke and headie preachers their disciples and followers, as refusing to be called of that sect, yet participates too muche with their humours, in maintayning the aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned errours; not onely aggreeing with the generall rule of all Anabaptistes, in the contempt of the ciuill Magistrate, and in leaning to their owne dreames and reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but particularly with this sect, in accounting all men prophane that sweares not to all their fantasies; in making for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particulare question of the policie of the churche, as great commotion, as if the article of the Trinity were called in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie; in making the scriptures to be ruled by their conscience, &amp; not their conscience by the Scripture; and he that denyes the leastiote of their groundes, <hi>sit tibi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ethnicus &amp; publicanus;</hi> not
<pb facs="13"/>worthie to enioy the benefite of breathing, muche lesse to participate with them of the Sacraments: and before that any of their groundes be impugned, let King, people, lawe &amp; all be tred vnder foote. Suche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie warres are to be preferred to an vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie peace: no, in suche cases, Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not onely to be resisted vnto, but not to be prayed for. For prayer must come of Faith, and it is reuealed to their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that GOD will heare no prayer for suche a Prince. Iudge then, Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if I wrong this sort of people, in giuing them the style of that sect, whose errours they imitate: and since they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to weare their liuerie, let them not be ashamed to borrowe also their name. It is only of this kinde of men, that in this book I write so sharplie; and whome I wishe my Sonne to punishe, in-case they refuse to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the lawe, and will not cease to stur-vp a rebellion. Whome against I haue written the more bitterlie, in respect of diuers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous libels, &amp; imurious speaches spred by some of them, not onely dishonourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue against all Christian princes, but euen reprochefull to our profession and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="13"/>in respect they are come out vnder coullour thereof: and yet were neuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered but by Papists, who generally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle aswell against them, as the religion it selfe; whereby the skandale was rather doubled, then taken away. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, I protest vpon mine honour, I meane it not generally of all preachers, or others, that likes better of the single forme of policie in our churche, then of the manie ceremonies in the churche of England; that are perswaded, that their Bishops smels of a Papall supremacie, that the Surplise, the cornerd cap, and suche like, are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badges of Popishe errours. No, I am so farre from beeing contentious in these things, (whiche for my owne parte I euer esteemed as indifferent) as I doe aequallie loue and honour the learned and graue men of either of these opinions. It can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes become me to pronounce so lightly a sentence, in so olde a controuersie. We all (God be praised) doe aggree in the groundes, and the bitternesse of men vpon suche questions, doth but trouble the peace of the churche; and giues aduantage and entry to the Papists by our diuision. But
<pb facs="14"/>towards them, I onely vse this prouision, that where the Lawe is otherwayes, they may content them selues soberly and quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etlie with their owne opinions, not resisting to the authoritie, nor breaking the lawe of the countrie; neither aboue all, sturring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rebellion or schisme: but possessing their soules in peace, let them preasse by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and well grounded reasons, either to perswade all the rest to lyke of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or where they see better groundes on the other part, not to be ashamed peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablie to incline thereunto, laying asyde all praeoccupied opinions.</p>
   <p>And that this is the onely meaning of my booke, and not any coldenesse or cracke in Religion, that place doth plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where, after I haue spoken of the faultes in our Ecclesiasticall estate, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort my sonne to be beneficiall vnto the good men of the ministry; praysing God there, that there is presently a sufficient nomber of good men of them in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and yet are they all knowne to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the forme of the Englishe churche. Yea, so farre I am in that place from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting corruption in Religion, as I wishe
<pb facs="14"/>him in promoouing them, to vse suche cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may praeserue their estate from creeping to corruption; euer vsing that forme through the whole booke, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I speake of bad preachours, tearming them some of the ministers, and not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or ministrie in generall. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point of Religion, what indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie of Religion can <hi>Momus</hi> call that in me, where, speaking of my sonnes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage (in-cace it pleased God before that time to cut the threed of my life) I plainly fore-warne him of the inconvenients that wer like to ensewe, in-case he should mary any that be of a different profession in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from him: notwithstanding that the nomber of Princes professing our Religion be so small, as it is hard to for-see, howe he can be that way, meetlie matched accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ranke.</p>
   <p>And as for the other point, that by some parts in this booke, it should appeare, that I doe nourishe in my minde, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue resolution against England, or some principals there; it is surelie more then wonderfull vnto me, vpon what groundes they can haue gathered suche conclusions.
<pb facs="15"/>For as vpō the one part, I neither by name nor description point out England in that part of my discourse; so vpon the other, I plainlie bewray my meaning to be of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish-men, where I conclude that purpose in these termes: <q>that the loue I beare to my Sonne, hath mooued me to be so plaine in this argument: for so that I discharge my conscience to him in vttering the verity, I care not what any traitour or treason-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower do thinke of it.</q> And English-mē could not therby be meant, since they could be no traitors, where they ought no alleageance. I am not ignorant of a wise and princelie apothegme, whiche the same Queene of England vttered about the time of her owne coronation. But the drift of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course doth fully cleare my intention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely grounded vpon that praecept to my Sonne, that he should not permit any vnreuerent detracting of his predecessors; bringing in that purpose of my mother on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an example of my experience anent Scottish-men, without vsing any perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to him of reuenge. For a Kings giuing of any fault the dewe stile, inferres no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the faulters pardon. No, I am
<pb facs="15"/>by a degree nearer of kinne vnto my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he is, neither thinke I my selfe, either that vn-worthie, or that neare my ende, that I neede to make suche a <hi>Daui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall</hi> testament; since I haue euer thoght it the duetie of a worthie Prince, rather with a pike, then a pen, to write his iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. But in this mater I haue no delite to be large, wishing all men to iudge of my future proiects, according to my bypast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
   <p>Thus hauing as muche insisted in the clearing of these two pointes, as will (I hope) giue sufficient satisfaction to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, and leauing the enuyous to the foode of their owne venome; I will hartlie pray thee, louing reader, charitably to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue of my honest intētion in this booke. I knowe the greatest part of the people of this whole Ile, haue bene very curious for a sight thereof: some for the loue they beare me, either being particularlie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me, or by a good reporte that perhappes they haue heard of me; &amp; therfore longed to see any thing, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from that authour whome they so loued &amp; honoured; since bookes are vine
<pb facs="16"/>Idees of the authours minde. Some onely for meere curiositie, that thinks it their honour to knowe all newe things, were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to glut their eyes there-with, onely that they might vaunt them to haue sene it: and some fraughted with cause-les en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy at the authour, did greedilie searche out the booke, thinking their stomack fitte ynough, for turning neuer so wholesome foode in noysome and infectiue humours. So as this their great concurrence in curiositie (though proceeding from farre different complexions) hath enforced the vn-tymous divulgating of this booke, farre contrarie to my intention, as I haue alreadie saide. To whiche <hi>hydra</hi> of diuerslie enclined spectators, I haue no targe to oppone but plainnesse, patience, &amp; sinceritie: plainnesse, for resoluing and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the first sorte; patience, for to beare with the shallownesse of the next; &amp; sinceritie to defie the malice of the third with-all. Though I cannot please all men therein, I am contented so that I onely please the vertuous sorte: &amp; though they also finde not euery thing therein, so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to answere their exspectation, as the
<pb facs="16"/>argumēt would seeme to requyre; although I would wishe them modestlie to remēber, that God hes not bestowed all his guifts v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pōone, but parted them by a Iustice distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiue; &amp; that many eies sees more then one; and that the varietie of mens mindes is suche, that <hi>tot capita tot sensus;</hi> yea &amp; that euē the very faces, that God hath by nature brought foorth in the world, do euery one in some of their particular line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, differ from any other: yet in truth it was not my intention in handling of this purpose (as it is easy to perceaue) fully to set down heere all suche grounds as mightout of the best writers haue bene alledged, &amp; out of my owne invention and experience added, for the perfite institutiō of a King: but onely to giue some suche praeceptes to my owne Sonne, for the gouernement of this kingdome, as was meetest for him to be instructed in, and best became me to be the informer of.</p>
   <p>If I in this booke haue bene too parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie plaine, impute it to the necessity of the subiect, not so muche being ordayned for the institution of a Prince in generall, as I haue saide, as contayning particular
<pb facs="17"/>praecepts to my Sonne in speciall: whereof he could haue made but a generall vse, if they had not contained the particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of this kingdome, with the best reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the same; whiche it became me best as a King, hauing learned both the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and practick thereof, more plainlie to expresse, then any simple schoole-man, that onely knowes maters of kingdomes by contemplation.</p>
   <p>But if in some places it seeme too obscure, impute it to the shortnesse thereof, beeing both for the respect of my selfe, and of my Sonne, constrayned there-unto: my owne respect, for fault of leasure, being so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually occupied in the affaires of my office, as my great burthen, &amp; rest-lesse fashery is more then knowne, to all that knowes or heares of me: for my Sonnes respect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I knowe by my selfe, that a Prince so long as he is young, will be so carried away with some sorte of delight or other, that he cannot patientlie abyde the reading of any large volume: and when he commes to a full maturity of age, he must be so busied in the actiue part of his charge, as he will not be permitted to bestowe many houres
<pb facs="17"/>vpon the contemplatiue part therof. So as it was neither fitte for him, nor possible for me, to haue made this treatise any more ample then it is. In-deede I am lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden to the curiositie of some, who thinking it too large already (as appeares) for lack of leasure to copie it, drewe some notes out of it, for speeds sake; putting in the one halfe of the purpose, and leauing out the other: not vnlike the man that alleadged that part of the Psalme, <hi>non est Deus;</hi> but left out the praeceeding wordes, <hi>Dixit insipiens in corde suo.</hi> And of these notes, making a little pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet (lacking both my methode and halfe of my mater) entituled it, for sooth, <hi>the Kings Testament:</hi> as if I had eiked a third Testament of my owne, to the two that are in the holy Scriptures. It is true that in a place thereof, for affirmation of the purpose I am speaking of to my Sonne, I bring my selfe in there, as speaking vpon my Testament: for in that sense, euery recorde in write of a mans opinion in any thing (in respect that papers out-liues their authours) is as it were a Testament of that mans will in that cace: and in that senseit
<pb facs="18"/>is, that in that place I call this treatise a Testament. But from any particular sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a booke, to giue the booke it selfe a title, is as ridiculous, as to stile the booke of the Psalmes, the book of <hi>Dixit insipiens,</hi> because with these words one of them doth begin.</p>
   <p>Well, leauing these newe baptizers and blockers of other mēs bookes, to their own follies, I returne to my purpose, anent the shortnesse of this booke: suspecting that all my excuses for the shortnesse thereof, shall not satisfie some, especiallie in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour countrie: who thought, that as I haue so narrowly in this treatise touched all the principall sicknesses in our kingdome, with ouertures for the remedies therof, as I said before: so looked they to haue found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therin, that should haue touched the sicknesses of their state, in the like sort. But they will easilie excuse me thereof, if they will consider the forme I haue vsed in this treatise; wherein I onely teache my Sonne, out of my owne experience, what forme of gouernment is fittest for this kingdome: &amp; in one parte thereof speaking of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, I plainlie there do excuse my selfe,
<pb facs="18"/>that I will speake no thing of the state of England, as a mater wherein I neuer had experience. I knowe, in-deed, no kingdome lackes her owne diseases, and likewayes what interest I haue in the prosperitie of that state: for although I would be silent, my blood &amp; discent doth sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it. But notwithstanding, since there is a lawfull Queene there presently raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who hath so long with so great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; foelicity gouerned her kingdoms, as (I must in true sinceritie confesse) the like hath not bene read nor heard of, either in our time, or since the dayes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour <hi>Augustus;</hi> it could no wayes become me, farre inferiour to her in knowledge and experience, to be a busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in other Princes maters, and to fishe in other folkes waters, as the prouerbe is. No, I hope by the contrary (with Gods grace) euer to keep that Christian rule, To doe as I would be done to: and I doubt no thing, yea euen in her name I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, by the bypast experience of her happy gouernment, as I haue already said, that no good subiect shall be more carefull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her of any corruptiōs stollē in in her
<pb facs="19"/>state; then she shall be zealous for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of her conscience and honour, to see the same purged, and restored to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient integritie: and further, during her time, becommes me least of any to medle in.</p>
   <p>And thus hauing resolued all the doubts, so farre as I can imagine, may be mooued against this treatise; it onely rests to pray thee (charitable reader) to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete fauourably this birth of mine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the integritie of the authour, and not looking for perfection in the worke it selfe. As for my part, I onely glory therof in this point, that I trust no sort of vertue is condemned, nor any degree of vice allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it: and that (though it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps so gorgeously decked, and richely atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it ought to be) it is at the least right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportioned in all the members, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mōstrous deformity in any of thē: and speciallie that since it was first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in secret, and is nowe published, not of ambition, but of a kinde of necessity; it must be taken of all mē, for the true image of my very minde, and forme of the rule, whiche I haue praescriued to my selfe and mine. Whiche as in all my actions I haue
<pb facs="19"/>hitherto preassed to expresse, so farre as the nature of my charge, and the condition of time would permit me: so beareth it a discouery of that, whiche may be looked for at my hand, and where-to, euen in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete thoughts, I haue engaged my self for the time to come. And thus in a firme trust, that it shall please God, who with my being and Crowne, gaue me this minde, to maintaine and augment the same in me and my posteritie, to the discharge of our conscience, the maintenance of our honor, and weale of our people, I bid thee hartelie fare-well.</p>
