   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and most reuerend Father in God, my L. Archbishop of Canturburie: One of the Lords of hir Maiesties most Honourable priuie Counsell: and Primate of all England.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue held the course</hi> (most reuerend Father) by the good sufferance of our most mercifull and louing Creator, in this Church of England; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and carefull sutes to the Lord our God, in holy praier and calling vpon his name; as, for the establishing and cōfirming of his children in holy life: so also for the conuersion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and sinners, that is, for iust and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, for all mankind: that in such our dutifull praiers, so far foorth as we might obtaine the same of our mercifull Father, his glorie might shine foorth, and all nations might know the
<pb facs="3"/>
saluation of our God. But I know not how it commeth to passe, hauing thus long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our publike praiers to this end, we begin in these later daies to doubt, and to reason, for whome we ought to pray; as though wee had neuer read in the scriptures, That all mankind ought to be deare vnto vs: Or as though the Apostle had neuer said vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 2.</note> That praiers, supplications, intercessions, and giuing of thanks, should be made for All men. Of which rule, and of the fourth verse thereof, S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> speaking,<note place="margin">Aug. tom. <hi>7.</hi> ad Artic. sibi fals. impos. Artic. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> saith, <hi>Siquidem Apostolus cuius ista est sententia, solicitè praecipit, quod in omnibus ecclesijs pijssimè custoditur, vt Deo pro omnibus hominibus supplicetur,</hi> For sure the Apostle, whose sentence this is, dooth most carefully commaund, and which thing is most godlie obserued in all churches, That supplications be made to God for All men. And <hi>Chrisostome</hi> doubteth not to say,<note place="margin">Chriso. in Mat. Hom. <hi>26.56.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Idcircò altari assistens Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos, prò vniuerso orbeterrarum, prò absentibus, atquè Praesentibus, Deo nos gratias iubet offerre,</hi> To this purpose, the Priest standing at the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commandeth vs to offer vp thanks to God for the whole vniuersall world, for the persons absent and Present, &amp;c And it seemeth by S. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> that it was a Christian mans profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb facs="3"/>
&amp; an outward badge of a Christian, euen to confesse, That he hath compassion on Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and such as are without, and excepted none, but praied for all: and therefore being required, to conuert to idolatrie, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul; he answered, <hi>Christianus ego sum,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In pas. bea. Ciprian. per Pont. Diaco.</note>
      <hi>&amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los alios deus noui nisi vnum, &amp; verum deum, &amp;c. Hunc nocte, dieque deprecamur prò omnibus, etiam prò imperatoribus, &amp;c.</hi> I am a Christiā (saith he) and know not any other gods but one, and the true God. Him wee intreat and pray vnto day and night, yea for Al men, and euen for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: which were then <hi>Galienus</hi> and <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> who were at that time the persecutors, and had by their letters commaunded that All men should worship the Roman gods. In rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these things (therefore) with a gret deale more, as followeth in the processe hereof (most reuerend Father) I wondered that men should be so deceiued, as to speake against that which they knew not, or to mislike that which was Apostolical, iust and good. That (therfore) I might releeue the error of the ignorant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: not doubting of the learned and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, (of whom I am readie to learne) I haue taken vpon me to write this Treatise, nothing fearing, but if they will in all humilitie learne,
<pb facs="4"/>
they shall easily be drawne forth of the snares, wherein they haue ben intangled, and discerne and confes the truth. So committing the same vnto your honorable and fatherly tuition: as being a point and question in Diuinitie, and now too much contended of, amongst the simple. Leauing you to your more weightier affairs, I cease any further at this time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat hereof.</p>
