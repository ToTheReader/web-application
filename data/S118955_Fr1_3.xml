   <p>Such are the lamentable Tymes, wherein we lyue, as that, they not only bring forth Men, who with great contention and heate of dispute, do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to mantayne particuler Errours, directly repugnant to the Scriptures, and the iudgment of Christ his Church; But also they affoard some others (as my owne experience assureth me, taken from my conuersing with diuers such, during my long endurance in England, and before my departure from thence) who are not affrayd to entertayne all Religions, with such a cold Indifferency, as that they hould, that Saluation may be obtayned in any Religion, if so the Professours
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> thereof do belieue only in the Trinity, the Incarnation, and such fundamentall points of Christianity; whether they be <hi>Papists, Protestants, Anabaptists, Brownists,</hi> or any other of these la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er Sects. They heerupon further teach, that we are not obliged, vnder payne of any spirituall losse, to imbrace any one of these Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, before another; scornefully tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all others, who exact a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, and articulate beliefe of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian misteryes.</p>
   <p>And thus these ADIAPHORISTS in Religion (whose secret pulse doth indeed beate vpon <hi>Atheisme</hi>) disclayme from all necessity of Truth, euen iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the defence of Errours, vnder the title of Errours; and houlding only this One mayne Controuersy in Christian Religion; to witt, <hi>That in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there are no mayne</hi> CONTROVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIES.</p>
   <p>Against these <hi>Ambi-dexter Christians,</hi> (so to call them) who drawe their Soules perdition in the ropes of a supine and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles security, I haue thought good to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the wryting of this short ensuing Treatise, styling it; <hi>One God, one Fayth,</hi> according to the words of the<note n="(1)" place="margin">
         <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.</note> Apostle;
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> implying hereby, That, as there is but one God, and not many; so this one God wilbe truly worshipped (for the sauing of our Soules) with one, only, entyre, and perfect Fayth, and not with multiplicity of Religions.</p>
   <p>Now to make the passage more euen to this discourse, by taking away some ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Obiections, much insisted vpon to the contrary by our <hi>Omni fidians</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, these men thus dispute: God is most mercifull, &amp; therefore it would be much repugnant to his infinite Mercy, to damne for all eternity, any Man that beleiueth in him, and in Iesus Christ as his Redeemer; so that withall, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare doing of all wrong, and do leade a vertuous (at least a morall) lyfe; though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>This then being most true, from hence it appeareth, that diuers cold Protestants much wrong the Catholikes, in charging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hem with want of Charity, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hey will not acknowledg, that Protestāts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ying Protestants, can be saued; whereas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n the contrary part many learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>estants (say they) do graunt the hope of Saluation to Catholikes, dying Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, or (as now a dayes they terme them) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>apists.</p>
   <p>To this we reply: That heere is no
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> want of charity in the Catholikes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a most vehement and burning Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For what greater Charity can there be, seing it is an vndeniable Truth, That Men dying in a false Faith, cannot be saued, then to premonish, and forewarne with all conuenient sedulity and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour<note n="(6)" place="margin">1. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 4.</note>
      <hi>opportunè, importunè,</hi> their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Brethren of so great a danger, as the euerlasting losse of their Soules cōmeth vnto? No; the soules interminable weale or woe is not a matter of Complement, that so for Ceremony, the remembrance thereof is to be forborne to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and often spoken of; especially where the most certaine truth of the matter insisted vpon, and the charitable intention of the speaker, do warrant the discourse.</p>
   <p>And if Catholikes must be censure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vncharitable, for these their so whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Admonitions; then by the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> reason, the Apostle himselfe is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> included within the like fault, who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely<note n="(7)" place="margin">Tit. c. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> chargeth vs, to flie the company &amp; society of an Heretike; &amp; of him who<note n="(8)" place="margin">
         <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.</note> rangeth Schismes &amp; Heresyes among those sinnes, the workers whereof shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not attayne the Kingdome of God. In
<pb n="9" facs="5"/> like sort, the auncient Fathers of Christs Church (I meane, <hi>Augustin, Ambrose, Ierome, Cyprian, Epiphanius,</hi> &amp; the rest) must stand chargeable with the like want of Charity, for their anathematizing and condemning (both in generall Councells, and in their particuler writings, &amp; Catalogues of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies) all such men, as did hould any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinions touching Fayth, against the then present Church of God.</p>
   <p>But to returne more particulerly to the Subiect of this Treatise. The source from whence this <hi>Libertinisme</hi> in beliefe (impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned heere by me) did take it origen and beginning, is the contempt of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christs Church, and the assumed authority of ech mans priuate Spirit. For thus reasoneth the <hi>Neutrallist</hi> in Religion: <hi>Both the Papists and Protestants do agree in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp;c. But they maynly dissent touching Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, praying to Saints, Freewill, Sacrifice of the Masse &amp;c. Therefore I will imbrace and follow the acknowledged doctrine of them both</hi> (meaning the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Passion) <hi>and hould it necessary only to Saluation, since in it all sides do conspire. But seeing the dissentions in religion amonge the Papists and the Protestants, are of
<pb n="10" facs="6"/> these secondary and lesse principall points only,</hi> (to wit, Purgatory, prayer to Saints &amp;c.) <hi>and seeing it is impossible, that both the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and the Papist should teach truly in the sayd Articles (for they teach meere contrary doctrines therein, so as if the one side teach true, it necessarily followeth, that the other side teacheth false:) And further; seeing I haue no more reason (once reiecting the authority of Gods visible Church) to belieue the one partie, more then the other, and it is impossible for me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them both: Therfore my priuat Spirit bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me to belieue neyther; but to hould the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Purgatory, prayer to Saints, Freewill, &amp;c. and all other controuerted points of Fayth, at this day, betweene the Papist and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, to be matters meerely accessory, and of such indifferency, as that neyther the true, or false beliefe of them can further, nor hinder my Saluation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus farre argueth our <hi>Newtrallist,</hi> who whyles he wilbe of all Religions, is indeed of no Religion. Then which (as if Religion were but a meere abstracted <hi>Notion in the mynd</hi>) what can be excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be more impious and Athiestical in it selfe? more repugnāt to the sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures? more crosse to the practise of all Antiquity? and (as heerafter shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
<pb n="11" facs="6"/> more aduerse to all naturall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
   <p>But <hi>(good Reader)</hi> as vnwilling to trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the accustomed limits of a Preface, I will detayne thee no longer; only for some delibation, and tast of the Subiect heerafter handled, I will conclude with the sentence and iudgment of <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> passed vpon the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who belieued in the Trinity, in Christ, and his Passiō, were men of honest and morall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; yet for houlding, That only by the force of Nature, without the assistance of Gods grace, a Man was able to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise vertue, &amp; flie vice (a point no more fundamental, then most of the Cōtrouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies betweene the Catholikes &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants) they are registred for Heretikes by <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> and consequently not to be (in his iudgment) in state of Saluation: His words are these:<note n="(9)" place="margin">
         <hi>Epist.</hi> 120. <hi>c.</hi> 37.</note>
      <hi>Nec tales sunt Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giani, quos facilè contēnas, sed continenter viuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, atque in omnibus operibus laudabiles: Nec falsum Christum, sed vnum, verum, aequalem{que} Patri, &amp; coaeternum, veraciter{que} hominem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, &amp; venisse credentes, &amp; venturum expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes; sed tamen ignorantes Dei iustitiā, suam constituere volentes, Haeretici sunt.</hi> Thus <hi>S.
