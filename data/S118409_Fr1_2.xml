   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ioyfull; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie proclaimed vnion of your Maiesties two famous kingdomes, England and Scotland into the name of <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> in one dutifull obedience of all, to one Royall Rightful Soveraigne over all, is the very Treasurie of the whole State; where your Maiestie is sole, &amp; high Treasurer of weale publique: &amp; your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne authoritie, beautified with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for executing lawes: with wisedome for determining Right: with mercy, and grace, for releeving distressed Subiects, is
<pb facs="3"/> the glorious abundant Treasure it selfe. And albeit I haue in my two bookes, like the poore widdowe, offered into your Treasury, but only <hi>two mites,</hi> yet I hope (&amp; for that doe most humbly pray your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favor) that your highnesse will bee pleased in goodnes to accept my humble service; &amp; duty, &amp; to lay vp my two mites with the rest of the rich Treasure, though in the account, they be scarcely reckoned for a farthing. I haue with that care, and caveat as is meete, only observed the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your highnes proclamation, and with dutiful, and due regard, left all other incident circumstances, and great consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to the wisedome of the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Commissioners, authorized by your Maiestie in both your Parliaments. As for all others, which dislike mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, and distaste my zeale, esteeming my labours lost, and better left vndone, then my reputation left vndone amonge them; I esteeme them only <hi>tanquam Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios
<pb facs="3"/> Censores</hi> trampling on truth, and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eies in their heeles, and not in their head; neverthelesse I desire (if may be) to avoide their kicking, and spurning: if not, yet because I knowe my farthing good silver, able to indure touch, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I haue without other respects in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this booke, scattered abroad the fire of my zeale, to shew it felfe in its own shine, and placed my happynesse in your Maiesties approving mine endevours, knowing that the king of kings acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the poore widdowe to haue cast in more into the Teasury, then al the rich men. Me selfe verily doe cast in all that I haue; and for my part, doe iudge it everie mans part, to depart from all, where hee oweth all. To this I can only adde my dayly praiers, and doe presently, and will still powre them forth to the God of all glorie, and mercie, lifting vp hands, &amp; heart, that his manifold, and dayly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings may bee multiplyed vpon your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb facs="4"/> person, vpon our gracious Queen, and vpon your Royall Seede for ever: and that all your kingdomes may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to your owne hearts desire, for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of foes, and endlesse comfort of all your loving Subiectes.</p>
