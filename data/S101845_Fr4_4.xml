      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He present age beeing so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare Musitions, amongst whome some by publike writings make an eliphant of a mouse: other by strange Paradoxes striue to attaine preheminence: I haue thought good amongst the rest, being as vertuously am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious as any, to expose my selfe to the world, cloathing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striuing so farre to auoyde a peremptory opinion of mine owne witte, as I take it an honor for mee to ascribe the little I deserue rather to the master that taught mee, then mine owne diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: onely this I protest for my selfe, that I haue studied so much as in me lieth to obserue a true <hi>decorum,</hi> which protestation I shall suppose for an <hi>indecorum</hi> also before it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by your allowance and fauors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you esteeme this, that I haue not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly haue I linkt my Musicke to number, as each giue to other their true effect, which is to mooue delight, which delight, as <hi>Socrates</hi> witnesseth in <hi>Platoes Philebo,</hi> is the daughter of Harmony. This vertue beeing so singular in the Italians, as onely vnder that ensigne they hazard their honor: I could aduise the studious in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke so to imploy themselues, that they might seeme to be rightly borne vnder the sweete aspect of <hi>Venus,</hi> which, as the Astronomers witnesse, is the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natrix in Musitians natiuities: it is the onely grace in a Musitian to follow this course, so to fitte both note and number as if like Twinnes of one mother, they may seeme to be all one which yeeldeth great abundance of variety. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I so much loue perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreate all the professed in Musicke to fly discord amongst themselues: though in composing of songes, it may be well taken, beseeching them so farre to fly selfe-opinion also, that ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all of them at their Countries honor, not their owne glory, they may by this meanes and in this manner outstrip any straunger, and make England as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Musitions, as it is and hath beene for soldiers: so leauing my labors to your fauourable iudgement, to keepe secret what may be amisse. I take heartie leaue.</p>
