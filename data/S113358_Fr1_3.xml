For how can those men be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in their consciences, that soules are immortal, which for the most part liue, as brute beastes do. Or that there be rewards repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the godly in heauen, or punishment ordeyned for wicked mē in hel, which do inno maner thing feare to trásgresse &amp; breake the cōmaundements of God, and do fal headlong into al kinde of vice and enormities, as though they did imagin, that either god is but a iesting stocke, and a sayned thing, or the soules and bodies do dye both at once. (as Pope Iohn the two &amp; twentith held.)</p>
   <p>Now I beseech thee (gentle Reader) what man is there, whome either the feare of Gods iustice doth withdraw from vice and sin, or yet doth induce and bring in minde to reforme and amende his life? wherin thou mayest iustly lament, and bewaile the folly &amp; state of men, and much wonder at their blindnesse, or rather mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which in such shortnesse &amp; vncertainty of life do so behaue themselues, that they haue no mind of any reformation, or amēd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life, when we bee croked for olde age, and haue then fearsely one day to liue: far off is it, that we go about, or intēd that thing, when we be yonkers, and in our flourishing age.

         </gap>4. 1. Thes 17.</note> First is vnbeliefe: for if we supposed not, that those things were fables, which are mentioned in the scriptures euery where of the last day of iudgement, and of the voyce of the Archangell, and of the trump of God, and of the throne of Gods seate, wherat al mé must stand, of the punishment of the wicked, of the euerlasting and blessed life, which the godly after this miserable life shal enjoy, of the resurrection of the bodies &amp; soules, eyther to be partakers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither of certaine ioye, or else of certaine paine, and also shall giue his accompt of al things, which he hath done, either intended, by thought, saide, or done, and how he hath vsed gods giftes and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, towards his needy members, &amp;c. VVithout al doubt &amp; que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion they would not liue thus ydlely &amp; naughtily as they do.</p>
   <p>The second cause is, the boldnesse (to sinne) vpon gods mercie: this boldnesse is great in very deede, but yet it is such as they may well ynough deceiue thēselues withal.<note place="margin">Eccles. 5.6. Ezech. 18.322 1. Pet. 3.9. Rom. 2.4.</note> For of boldnesse they haue no sure trial at al. So Salomon saith, say not, the mercie of God is great: he wil forgiue me my manifold sinnes: for mercy and wrath came from him, and his indignation commeth downe vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. &amp;c. with this boldnesse I say, the wicked enimie of mankinde kepeth man in sinne continually, but like as god graunteth forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenesse at the first to the repentaunt: so doeth he also sharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those sinners which do continue obstinately (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) in vice and sin. For such men then, as repent not vnfainedly, and purpose to leade newe liues, conceiue a false hope and bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the mercie of God. And by this meanes that the Diuell setteth forth to men this boldnesse, he bringeth this to passe, that they liue on forth quietly, and securely in vice and wickednesse, and thinke little or nothing with themselues at any time of anye reformation or amendment. And herein they despise the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and riches of the bountifulnesse &amp; long suffering of god, being ignoraunt, that the goodnesse of god doth induce, and lead vnto repentaunce.</p>
   <p>The third cause is, the custome of sinne, which is in a manner,
<pb facs="5"/>
made naturall in long continuance. For like as it is harde for a mā to alter nature:<note place="margin">VVisdo. 14.19. Levit. 18.30. Iereme. 13.23. Ecclesi. 4.12.12.</note> so custome, if it be once rooted, cannot easily bee plucked vp and expelled. And therefore it is that learned men doe cal custome an other nature. It is as a certaine wiseman saith: such vices as we haue accustomed our selues to, from our tender age, cannot be without great difficultie weeded out afterward, whiche thing though it be very certaine and true, yet who seeth not how fondly fathers and mothers bring vp their children in cockering,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.4. Eccle. 30.7.9.</note> and pampering them: from their infancie they bee giuen to none other thing, but to pride, delicious fare, and vaine idle pleasures and pastimes.</p>
   <p>VVhat prodigious apparel, what vndecēt behauiour, what boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, bragging, quarelling and ietting vp and down, what quassing, feasting, ryoting, playing, dauncing and dicesing, with other lyke felowship that is among them▪ it is a wonder to see.<note place="margin">Eccl. 30.11.12.13.</note> And the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can hereat reioyce and laugh with them, and giue libertye to their children to doe what they liste, neuer endeuouring to tame and salue their wilde appetites. VVhat marueyle is it, if they bee found thus naughtie and vicious, when they come to their full yeares, and mans state, which haue of children bene trayned and entred with suche vice▪ whereof they wil alwayes taste,<note place="margin">Horatius.</note> as <hi>Horace</hi> saith, <hi>Quod nouatesta capit, inueterata sapit.</hi>
      <q>
         <l>The Vessel wil conserue the tast of lycour very long,</l>
         <l>With which it was first seasoned, and thereof smelful strong:</l>
         <l>Euen so a child, if that he be in tender yeares brought vp</l>
         <l>In Vertues schoole, and nurtred wel, wil smel of Vertues cup.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>If these men therfore at any time do fully purpose to repent the and reforme their liuing: as when their conscience moueth them, or the burthen of their sinne pricketh them:<note place="margin">Eccle. 5.7.</note> yet custome hath so preuailed in them, that they fal into worse and worse enormities, and like mad men desire the reformation of their life.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>Consider I pray thee (good Reader) what ioly yonkers and lusty brutes these wil be, whé they shal come to be Citizens, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medlers in matters of the common welth:<note place="margin">Proverb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>.30.1.</note> which by their fathers haue ben thus nicely and wantonly cockered vp neuer correcting nor chasting them for any faults and offences whatsoeuer. VVhat other thing but this, is the cause that there be now so many adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, vnchast and lewde persons and ydle Rogues? That we haue such plentie of Dicers, Carders, Mummers &amp; Dauncers▪ And that such-wickednesse and filthy liuers are spred about in euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only naughty education and bringing vp: wel then, suche as impute this thing to the newe learning and preaching of the gospel are shamefully deceiued, hauing no iudgement to iudge of things No, no, the newe learning and preaching of the Gospell is not the cause hereof, but the naughty, wanton and foolish brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of children by their parents, as I haue declared.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Luke. 14.23. Deut. 21 18 19.20.21.</note>Also the slacknesse and vnreadinesse of the Magistrates to doe and execute their office, is a great cause of this: if they that vse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, playing, and walking vp and downe the streates, in time of a Sermon: if disobedient children, to their parents. If Dicers Mū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ydellers, dronkerds, swearers, Rogues &amp; Dauncers, and such as haue spent and made away their liuing in belly cheare and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftinesse were streightly punished, surely ther shuld be lesse oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion giuen to offend, &amp; also good men should not haue so great cause to complain of the maners of men of this Age. Therfore the magistrate must remēber his office: For he beareth not his sworde for naught, for he is gods minister and a father of the coūtrey ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of god, to punish offenders: but nowadayes by reason of libertie without punishmente, and slackenesse of men in office, which wink at their faults, causeth so many idle players &amp; daūcers to come to the Gallows as there are, for as the wise man saith, who so prohibiteth not men so to offend when he may, in a maner cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them so to do:<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> 12.13.14.</note> for it is better to be a subiect to a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate vnder whom nothing is lawfull, than vnder him, to whome al things is lawful. I feareme gretly therfore, least the heathen més seueritie, and streightnesse in punishing vice, shal be a reproch to our magistrars, and accuse them at the last day for their negligence
<pb facs="6"/>
and slacknesse herein. It is not inough to punish sinne only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to preuent and take away the causes thereof.</p>
   <p>The fourth cause is,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.15.</note> Securitie in wealth and prosperitie, which doth inebriate the mindes of men in suche sort, that they neyther remember God, nor constantlye purpose to reforme and amende their liues. Therfore it was wel sayd of one, that like as of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie riot proceedeth: Euen so of riot cōmeth both other cōmon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and also vngodlynesse, and the neglecting of Gods word and commaundements: And as <hi>Seneca</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
