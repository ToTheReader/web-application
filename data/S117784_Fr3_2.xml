      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had set furth two partes of my</hi> Herbal / conteining those plantes and herbes whereof y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> old writers haue written and made mention / because that I knew both by myne owne experience / and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mennis writinge / that the herbes found after the old writers tyme / if they were knowen with their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues / should be very necessary for the healing of many di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seases / greuous sicknesses / woundes / sores / brusinges / and breaking as well inward as outward. I thought I should do no small benefit vnto my countre / if I wrote of those plantes. Whereof I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as many as I knowe / or at the least as many as came to my remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brance / leuing the rest that I haue not intreated of / to be intreated of other that haue more leasure then I haue. For surely beyng so much vexed with sicknes / and occupyed with preaching / and the study of Diuinitye and exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cise of discipline / I haue had but smal leasure to write Herballes. This smal booke I geue and dedicate vnto you / not only because this part for the big<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that it hath / intreateth most largely and plenteously of simples that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto Surgery / but also because beyng amongest you in London all that I was aquaynted withall / and namely Maister Wright / late Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the Quenes highnes / so willing and desyrous to learne and know such herbes as were not throwly knowen in England at that tyme. If ye take this my poore present in good worth / I thinke that I haue bestowed my laboures well / and if I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue this / it may be an occasion / that if God send me health / leasure and longer life / that I take some more paynes for your profit in some other matter. The Lorde kepe you.</p>
