   <head>The life of <hi>Eunapius,</hi> chiefly gathered <hi>out of his owne writings.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ʋnapius</hi> was borne at <hi>Sardies,</hi> the chiefe Cittie of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and from a Childe, Scholer of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santbius,</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Sardeis,</hi> and a sacred Prelate in <hi>Lydia,</hi> and his kinsman, (for he had marryed <hi>Melita,</hi> that was <hi>Eunapius</hi> Cousine) by whose perswasion, he wrote the liues of certaine Philosophers, Oratours, &amp; professours in Phisick, not resisting his Maisters autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: He Sailed from <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> to get learning, when he was sixeteene yeeres of age, at the which time, he sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he had a curled &amp; thick heayre, somewhat white by many hoarye heayres, appearing with the other, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the brightnes of Siluer, after the manner of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sea. In that passage he was taken with a vehemēt ague, gotrē, as it should seeme, by the tossing of the Sea, which, in short time, did so enfeeble and diminish the strength of the young man, that not beeing able to go a foote, he was borne by the hands of his Countrimen, that came with him in the iorney, from <hi>Piraeo,</hi> the Porte of <hi>Athens,</hi> to <hi>Proaeresius</hi> house: whose fame brought him foorth. Where, the disease encreasing, and at length, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in desperation, one <hi>Aeschines</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> a man of that sort, that prooueth practise by mens death, opened the young mans mouthe, with certaine yron instruments, and put in a medicine, by the which, the body was well, purged, and the patient began to amend: All the which, were more happelye doone then was hoped, and not knowne to <hi>Proaeresius,</hi> although the thing being straight
<pb facs="8"/>
knowne, and a great fame of his recouerye. <hi>Proaeresius,</hi> hearing the young man to be of great hope, did prayse him openly, in a publike audience, and whiles he liued, vsed him as his deere Childe, and he likewise, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him as a God, with great reuerence for the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his vertue, &amp; singular learning. He entred to the state of man, (as himselfe sayth) when <hi>Iulianus</hi> was slaine in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> were Emperours. The fyft yeare after he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he would haue gon into <hi>Aegipt,</hi> taking example of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but he was forbidden by his parents, and called home to <hi>Lydia,</hi> whether he retourned: as I can perceyue, against his wyll.</p>
   <p>He was right well learned in Physicke, by his owne testimonie, in so much as he was chiefe in that order, when olde <hi>Chrysanthius</hi> was let bloude, before <hi>Oribasius,</hi> that was moste excellent in Physicke was come, being called to it. He wrote also a Chronicle, in the which he she weth the liues of the Emperours, from <hi>Heredianes</hi> time, to his age, the which (I heere) is kept in the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>se,</hi> as a monument: it appeared he was not much desirous of glorye, for he neuer nameth himselfe, beyng content to call him selfe, the wrighter of this Treatise.</p>
   <p>He was much giuen to the Gentils sect, ennemy to the Christians: which, as a Rat, bewraying himselfe, he vttereth euery where, chieflye when he reprooueth <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, for ouerthrowing the noble Temples of the Gods, thorowghout the worlde, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting howses, of Christian men: And where he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth, that when the Goddes Temples were put downe, Monkes were brought into holy places, and Martirs and Saints heades, (as he scoffith) beyng salted,
<pb facs="9"/>
were shewed and worshipped for Gods. It seemeth he was professed to the secret misteries of the Goddesses <hi>Eleusines,</hi> and of the chiefe Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>st of the place, (whose name he had rather passe in silence, then bewraye wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly) admitted to the order of the <hi>Eumolpidan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s,</hi> and that he had the roome of a chiefe Minister, (whom they call <hi>Hierophanta,)</hi> although he were not that Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y man, contrary to <hi>Eumolpus</hi> lawe, by the which, it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. He seemeth to follow, not the maner of the speeche of <hi>Asia,</hi> which is superfluouse, and ful of words, but a pure, and as it were, a painted kinde, which was then peculiar to the sect of <hi>Sophistes,</hi> which do not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the thinges, but rather expresse them with liuelye colours, and so setteth them before the eyes, as a man would thinke he saw them presently, yet is he brefe: and beside he gathered in euery place, the learned flowers, of Poets and Philosophers, and as starres placeth them in his Stile.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, as touching the title by the name of <hi>Sophis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> (which was euyll thought of) they are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, that were learned in arte, especially in Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: And can sustaine publike profession with prayse. Who now for the most part are honoured with the name of Maisters. So as they be Philosophers, whom <hi>Tacitus,</hi> calleth teachers, and <hi>Fabius</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of <hi>Sapience.</hi> And <hi>Sophistes,</hi> readers of liberall artes; or otherwise of great name.</p>
