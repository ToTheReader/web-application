   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause Prayer vnto God is a most Christian exercise and fruit of faith / being rightly vsed: having so many commaundements and promises concerning it in the Scripture: by which we come most neare vnto God / as in any other part of his worship / speaking to him (as it were) mouth to mouth / when we lift vp our hearts and powre forth our requests vnto the Lord: it was thougt needfull / seing these latter Treatises of Mr. Greenwoods towching this Argumēt are now published agayne / ād his first concerning it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had / here therefore to note downe briefly a few things both cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine ād right vse of praier: ād in particular concerning read prayer / by meanes whereof it is come to passe that true praier is so much vnknowē / neglected / ād profaned. And this we pray thee (Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian Reader) to take in good part / and to examine vp the word of God / which is the onely rule of truth / and light of our feet in the darknes of this World.</p>
   <p>Prayer is the lifting vp off the heart vnto God / to call vpon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / with faith / by the work and help of his Spirit. Psal. 25.1. Rom. 10 1;.14. Mat. 21.22. Rom. 8.26.27.</p>
   <p>Praier is eyther with words / or without words. With words / being vttered in speach / eyther publickly or privately: eyther in mo or fewer words: yet alway briefly: according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o the present and severall occasiōs. Exod. 32.11.12.13. Ezra. 9.6.15 / 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Without words / being conceyved onely in the mynd / and so presented before the Lord who knoweth the thoughts and secrets of the heart. Exod. 14.15 / <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>. Sam. 1.12.13. Esa. 38.14.</p>
   <p>Prayer is eyther Request or Thankesgiving. Both these are eyther for our selves / or for others. Request for our selves / is deprecatiō or sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plication: for others / intercession. 1. Tim. 2.1.</p>
   <p>Deprecation is for some evill to be kept or removed by the Lord frō vs. Mat. 6.13. and 8.24.25. Psal. 70. Gen. 32.9.12 / 2. Cor. 12.8. Iā. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>.13.</p>
   <p>Supplication is for some good thing to be graunted or cōtinewed of God vnto vs. Mat. 6.9.12. Gen. 24.12. Exod. 33.12.13. Psal. 4.6. Luk. 11.13. and 17.5.</p>
   <p>Intercession is for others / eyther for some good to be given / or some evill to be taken from them. Mat. 6.9.11.12. and 5.44. Exod. 32.11.12. 13. Ephes. 6.18.19.20. Rom. 15.30.31.32. Iam. 5.14.18 / 1. Ioh. 5.16.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Thankesgiving is the yeelding of praise and thāks vnto God for his mercy and benefits eyther given or promised. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
   </p>
   <p>Prayer is to be made alwayes and onely in the Mediation of Christ. Ioh. 14.13.14.1. Tim. 2.5. Not that this need alway to be mentioned / but that we ought alway to come before God and present our selves / and our prayers vnto him with faith in the Mediation of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by whom alone / we and al our sacrifices are made acceptable vnto God. For in him are all the promises of God yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. Through him are all the graces ād mercyes of God conveyed vnto vs Ioh. 1.16. Ephes. 4.7. By his Mediatiō our prayers being presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father / all the weaknes / want of faith love hope / ād any other corruption wherewith our prayers (as they proceed from vs) be distey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned / are covered and taken away. Because he putteth the sweet odour of his Mediation vnto our prayers / and so presenting them to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / they are accepted of him. Rev. 8.3.4. with Exod. 30.7.8. Psal. 141.2 Mar. 9.22.23.24 / 1. Pet. 2.5.</p>
   <p>For this cause therefore / must prayer / in faith / alway respect Gods promise / and Christs Mediation. Mar. 11.24. Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34. Heb: 7.25. and 9.24. And for the same cause / must the person that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth first be accepted of God in Christ / before their prayers and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can be approved. Rev. 1.5.6 / 1. Pet. 2.5. Prov. 15.8, Hag. 2.13.14.15. Gen. 4.3.4.5. and 6.8. and 8.20.21. with Heb. 11.4.7. Wherevpon we are bound to be carefull / first our selves to be in the true faith and Church of Christ / vnder his Mediation / that we may our selves be accepted of the Father in him: and then in faith to offer our prayers / both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and maner / so as we have warrant by the word of God / that he wil heare vs / ād that Christ will be our Mediatour / therein. For which see the Scriptures a foresaid: and Mat. 6.9 Ephes. 2.19. and 4.4.5.6. Act. 2.41.47. Exo. 30.9. Levi. 17.3.7. Deut. 12.5.8. Psal. 16.4. and 50.8.14.16 17.23. Esa. 1.12. etc. Mal. 1.14 / 1. Tim. 2.1.2.5.8. Iam. 1.5.8. Iohn 5. 13.14. Rev. 8.3.4.</p>
   <p>For our better direction and assurance herein / hath Christ givē that forme of prayer / which is commonly called the Lords prayer. Mat. 6. 9.13. Luk. 14.1.2.3.4. Where he hath prescribed a direction for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all our prayers both for matter and maner according to that rule. For in it we are taught / as towching the matter of all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers / that they be for things first and chiefly concerning Gods glory / and then concerning our good / so as will stand with the glory of God. Ioh. 12.27.28. And towching the maner of prayer / that it be in faith hope and love / with reverence / briefly and humbly propounded / that he in al may be glorifyed. In faith (I say) both of Gods willingnes to heare ād help / as being our Father in Christ / ād of his ability therevnto as being in heaven able to do whatsoever he will. Esa. 63.16. Psal. 115.3. In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe / of his mercy and favour towards vs / he being our Father and we his children in Christ. Luc. 11.9.13. In love both off God and one off
<pb facs="3"/>
another / in Christ. Psa. 116.1. Mar. 11.25.26. Act. 4.24. With reverēce / as coming before our heavenly Father / who is full off glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty / he in heaven / we on earth etc. And therefore also ought our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers briefly and hunbly to be propounded: not seking after long or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted speach / nor vsing vayne repetitions etc. Mat. 6.7.8.9. Genes. 18.27. Exood. 34.8.9. Ecclesiast. 5.1.</p>
   <p>And note here / that Christ hath propounded this direction / not by way off exhortation or doctrine / as in other cases he was woont / but in forme off petitions / and those very brieff: Least otherwise we should have doubted that we might not with such confidence in few words have spoken directly vnto God himselff: but that we must have vsed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediatours for vs / as the Papists / or sighs onely without words as the Anabaptists / or never ceasing from prayer / as the Eutychians / or at least some long circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stāce off words ād great affectatiō of speach or the like / as ignorance / superstition / and hypocrisy are ready to lead vnto.</p>
   <p>Finally / in this forme off prayer / by Christ we are taught / that the end and scope off all our prayers / ought to be the glory God in Christ. And that therefore we pray alway / with submission off our selves and our requests vnto his will / who being King and Lord ouer all / know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and will performe what he seeth best for his glory and our good. Mat. 6.13.</p>
   <p>And thus prayer conceyved or vttered in five words / is better then ten thousand otherwise / as the Apostle speaketh of prayer in another case / 1. Cor. 14.19.</p>
   <p>Now the help which God hath promised ād giueth vnto vs in praier is his Spirit. Which is as the fyer / quickning and stirring vp our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to and in prayer: given of God vnto vs for the helping off our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes / that we by it in faith should call vpon the Lord our Father in Christ: Rom. 8.26.27. Gal. 4.6. with Exod. 30.7.8. And this fitly agreeth with the nature of God / who as he is a Spirit in himselff / so wil he off vs be worshipped in Spirit and truth. Ioh. 4.24. Ephes. 6.18.</p>
   <p>Other helps as off praying vpō a book / or of beads / or the like / read we not any appointed by God. Many tymes in deed we read in the Scripture off the prayers off the faithfull made to the Lord / but never off any one that read their prayers vpon a book or reckned them vpon beads etc. And no marvell / seing the Lord did never eyther commaund to vse / or promise to accept such service off him. Therefore must it needs be / that book prayers / etc. are an invention off man / and a vayne worship off GOD. Exod. 20.4.5.6. Esaie 29.13. Matthe. 15.9.</p>
   <p>Neyther can this stand with the nature and dutyes off prayer / befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mentioned: But in deed breedeth and nourisheth both ignorance and neglect off true prayer / as by lamentable experience may be seen.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>But into this poynt we will not now further enter / seing it is sufficiēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in these Treatises which were purposely written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. Onely because Mr. Henry Barrow (who was Mr. Greēwoods
fellow prisoner and fellow Martyr) hath also written of this point / and namely cōcerning the book of cōmō prayer particularly in some books of his / which now are scant to be gotten / we thought it good likewise / from thence to annex these few lynes following cōcerning it. Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row therefore in his discovery of the false Church / speaking of the book of common prayer / writeth thus: Pag. 64.65.66.67.</p>

      <item>1. <hi>In that they presume to giue and enioyne their prescript wordes in praier, they take the office of the holie Ghost a waye, quēch the spirit of the ministrie, and of the whole Church, stop and keepe out the graces of God, thrust their owne idle devises vpon the whole Church, yea vpon God himselfe vvhether he wil or no:</hi>

      <item>3. <hi>In that by this their Leitourgie they prescribe vnto the Church what Scriptures publiquelie to read and vvhen to reade them, as these Chapters and Psalmes at their mattēs before noone, those at afternoone &amp;c.

      </item>
      <item>4. <hi>In that they shread, rend, and dismember the scriptures from the holie Order and natural sense of their context, to make them Epistles, Gospels, Lessons, select Psalmes, to their festivals and idol worship abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue-said, They most heinouslie pervert and abuse the Scriptures to the high dishonor of God &amp; their owne feareful iudgment.</hi>

      <item>5. <hi>In that they bring in ād cōmaunde the Apocrypha writings to be publiquelie read in the Church: They both mainetaine and publiquelie teach the dangerous errors therin contayned, to the poysoning and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the faith of the church.
