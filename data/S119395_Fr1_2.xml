   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Propound (Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in this most briefe Treatise, the principall Grounds of our Religion, in the most compendious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The cause of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie is this: There be many poore servants and laborers; many that are of trades and manuall Sciences; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aged Persons of weake and decaied memories: Of these, some never learned so much as to reade, some very little, and the most of them haue, or will have, small leisure to learne long discourses: the world, or other vanities, taking up their thoughts and cares. Yet all these haue immortall soules, to remaine after a few daies, in eternall ioyes, or in endlesse paines. Of these care must be had: and the rather, because many of them haue little care of themselues. To these, the longest tractates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing displeasing, I direct the shortest. For, better a little well learned, then a great deale not learned at all. In which, I comprehend much matter in few words: and draw together, into the narrowest
<pb facs="3"/>space, those things, which I iudged most needfull for them to know unto salvation. I haue confirmed the same in the margent with proofes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, selected out of many which might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and for their greater ease and benefit, I haue expressed the words themselues; and where neede is, as the streightnesse of roome would permit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed them: that they may see herein, not man teaching them, but God. Jf they would take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paines, to learne these few points without booke, they might haue matter of good meditation, when they are about their workes, and travailing in worldly affaires: and so their earthly dealings should be more blessed. Also, they may receiue greater profite by the Scriptures they reade, and Sermons they heare, when they know to what head or ground of Doctrine, to referre that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. And may by this meanes come better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Lords Table. Wherefore, I earnestly exhort them, as from my heart desiring their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to reteine the grounds of heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in perfect memorie: to labour to haue their hearts affected therewith: and to manifest there knowledge by an holy conversation. That living vertuously, they may die comfortably: and after this short and uncertaine life is ended, come to bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed immortalitie.</p>
