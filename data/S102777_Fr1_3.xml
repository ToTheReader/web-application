      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the reading of Histories be so necessary, &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic al to al sorts of people, as they be rightly termed, by some the mirrors, and maisters of our life, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and teaching vs by the lawes and gouernments of other nations and common-weales, what orders and institutions are fittest to bee ordayned, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in our own for the establishment of perfect peace, maintainance of diuine worship and excercise of moral vertues.</p>
   <p>I doubt not (good courteous Reader) but the commendation of this Worke, and other Histories of like argument, expressed at large by the Author in his preface, will passe so currant with thee, as thou wilt willingly conclude with him, That there is nothing more pleasant, more profitable, nor more prayse worthy, then truly, <hi>legendo, aut pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinando,</hi> either by reading or trauelling, to know and vnderstand the situation, lawes, customes, religion, and forme of gouernement of each seuerall Prouince in the world. And seeing also that (besides our sloth and home-lou'd idlenesse) there be so many rubbes, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hinder and deterre vs from trauell, as it is, in a maner, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected, and we thereby depriued of the one halfe of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: how much more industrious ought we to be, (for supply of that defect) to busie our selues in reading the reports of such Writers, (both an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ient and moderne) as haue spent most part of their times in that kind of exercise, and do (as it were) proffer vs their hands to lead and conduct vs through each seuerall country.</p>
   <p>In which rancke, mine Author, and those auncient and famous writers, out of which this collection is gathered (though it cannot bee denied but that there hath beene <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

retaine the selfe same customes &amp; ceremonies by them described) are not in the meanest regard, nor their sayings in any wise to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in regard of the number of late writers, who though some of them haue beene men of that fame and repute, and withal so perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in their relations, as they haue come farre neerer vnto the truth of our present estate, yet is there no reason that a multiude of <hi>Mandiuels</hi> that wander abroad in this pampletting age in the habite of sincere Historioghraphers (like Asses in Lyons skins) should dazell and dim the glory of the other, or cancel and deface their opinions so autenticke and anciently receiued. For mine owne part I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my insufficiency, truely to discerne betwixt the one and the other, yet thus much I may presume to say in the behalfe of mine Author, that (to my weake vnderstanding) in al the course of his bookes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth no vntruths to make them seeme probable, nor meere probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for true, but relateth things doubtful as he found them written by others, and so leaueth euery man to his discretion, to giue credit as hee sees cause: And although hee maketh mention of some ceremonies &amp; customes vsed in certaine countries, which seeme so absurde, monst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and prodigious, as they appeare vtterly voide of credit yet is there no cause that that should distast any one, considering that (as hee well noteth in the conclusion of his third booke) all people are not indued with like ciuility, and that there is as great difference in mens liuings as in their collours.</p>
   <p>The pleasure which I tooke by perusal of these seuerall collections, and the profit that I conceiued might thereby redound both to my selfe and others, together with the approbation of my indeauours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the workes by some worthy, and worthily respected friends, whose Iudgements doe farre exceed mine owne, incouraged mee to vndergoe the businesse, and to proceed in that I had already begunne with more alacrity, which after much labour I haue now at length finished, and suited in this ragged liuery, and made him to speake in a phrase though not eloquent, yet I hope plaine and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. And albeit a tale may be much improued by a formal manner of telling, yet gold is more esteemed of for his goodnesse then for his collour, and the worthinesse of the worke ought to bee of more regarde then the elegancy of the phrase, the one beeing the substance, the other but the shadow.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
As for the nice curiosity of such word-weighing Crittickes, as will sooner find two faults in another, then amend one in themselues: I lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle esteeme, either of them or their censures. But if (for want of other matter to quarrell at) any <hi>Momus</hi> should accuse my pen for mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: I protest, I may truly answer them with the very words of mine Author, that what I haue done, was not <hi>Spe lucri ulsius, neo popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris aurae ambitione, verumenimuero tam libero, &amp; plane otioso studio, quam rei ipsius mira dulcedine at que vtilitate.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If I haue omitted or misconstrued any abolete words or sentences for their harshnesse and ill coherence, or erred in setting downe the true quantitie of weights and measures, (for auoyding whereof I haue most commonly vsed the Latine words themselues) or in describing the disguised apparell of sundry people, as namely those rude sauages cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tovovpinambaltii,</hi> beeing so different from all other nations, as (keeping the sence (I could hardly adapt them to our owne English phrase, or if I haue shewed my selfe too affectionate in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our owne country, in my inlargement added to the chapter of England, where I supposed mine Author was too sparing: or (to bee short) if in the confession of the Aethiopians faith, or the Epistles written from Prester <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Pope, and kings of Portugall, or in any other place, or by any other meanes, I haue ought mistaken, or squared from the true meaning of the writers: Bee pleased (courteous and friendly Reader) in humanity patiently to passe them ouer, and impute such errors and escapes, rather to the want of knowledge of the truth, than want of will to expresse the truth.</p>
   <p>And so concluding (with this one onely aduertisement that if in the whole course of these bookes, thou meete with any thing that, in thy opinion, doth ouermuch exalt the ceremonies of the Church of Rome, thou wilt consider, that the Author was an absolute Papist, as well thou mayst perceiue, and therefore of likelihood would by all meanes he could, aduance and make the best of his owne Religion: nor did I thinke it the part of a Translator, by marginall notes to suppresse his opinions, but in this place rather to forewarne thee, which (as the Prouerbe sayth) doth fore-arme thee, how to giue credit in those cases. I commit these my labours to thy fauour able consideration, and thy selfe to Gods holy protection: Resting thine in what he is able,</p>
