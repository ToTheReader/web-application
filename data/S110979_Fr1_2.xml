   <head>THE PREFACE TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> wrote my two first bookes beeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly distracted, &amp; my spirit surseized with feare, foresaw the dismal chaunce that is nowe come vpon vs. The sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sermons, the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pairing of a dutifull respect to the king, the cōmon reports that were spred abroad of his death, before his death, the encrease of the Iesuits, &amp; by a consequent the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their maxims, made many to suspect shrewdly, &amp; it was no great praise to bee a prophet. We haue therefore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, &amp; foretold the future calamity that was like to betide vs to our great losse, &amp; spake more true in it, then we could wish to haue done; Vpon the downefall of this so great a <hi>Prince</hi> many haue powred out
<pb facs="3"/>
the torrents of their eloquence, and haue bewailed him with so much art, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath no more left to say. And to speak the truth wordes are too weak and feeble signes to expresse such a griefe; light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions speak, when the greater are dumbe, and with the vaile of silence cover that which cānot be vttered. O miserable age! The murdering therefore of kings will ere long turne into a custome; and the naturall respect that the French were wont to haue of their Soveraigne bee choaked by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. We see it to our great griefe. For whosoever shal hereafter take vpō him to attēpt the life his king, shal be vnderpropt by many examples, &amp;, which is more, shall not want for rules: and if this growing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be not by time prevented, it wil at last be held a punishment to raigne, &amp; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of our kings, shall be as it were a consecratiō of sacrifices markt out for the slaughter. For howbeit the singular wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vigilant care of our <hi>Queene</hi> his Maiesties spowse hath served vs as a prop to sustaine our ruinous estate, yet may wee say that in <hi>him</hi> Fraunce hath lost the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyest king it hath had these many yeares, and the manner of whose death is a fatall
<pb facs="3"/>
example, and a grand caveat to posterity.</p>
   <p>This wound did so smart, that I coulde never get my fingers of from it, nor for a long time togither settle my selfe about fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the remainder of this work. Griefe which of its owne nature is idle, is then so most especially, when the thing grieved at is past all remedy. Herevnto adde that this <hi>third booke,</hi> which entreats <hi>of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of prophecies,</hi> togither with the interpretatiō of them, requires a more cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed spirit then the two former did: For as God intending to reveale future events to his prophets, withdrew them aside, and carryed them either to the desert, or els to the sea shore, that so having pluckt them from amidst the presse, he might setle their mindes in a quiet repose; So thinke I, that to diue into their prophecies a man neede be free from all cares, &amp; to partake of their rest, that he may partake of the cleerenesse of their spirit. And, indeed, what by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the publike griefe, the greatest part whereof hath fallen vpon vs, and what by reason of many interruptions, I had never dared to haue set vpon this matter, had not the excellent spirit of the <hi>King of Great Brittaine</hi> enlightened me, and if in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
<pb facs="4"/>
of these prophecies I had not been assisted by experience, which is the cause, that I haue more need of a memory herein, then any extraordinary revelation. God also, whom I here invoke to mine aide, wil by his spirit sharpen the dulnesse of mine, and as hee hath given this property to the sea-cards needle to stand firme in the most violent tempests, so is he able to giue his servants a piercing wit, and a setled minde amidst this confusion. He reveales his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to those which feare him, and makes them to vnderstand his will. Now that no man may accuse me of rashnesse herein, as though I did too curiously pry into after ages, or presumptuously gaue mine owne interpretations for rules; the reader shall do well to consider, that it is one thing to <hi>prophecy,</hi> another thing to <hi>speak of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of prophecies:</hi> the one is done by reve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation, the other by experience; for the one we need to be inspired from aboue, for the other we need nothing but a memory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with some insight in the present times. The Prophets drew their <hi>prophecies</hi> from the counsell of God, but we finde the <hi>accomplishment of their prophecies</hi> in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by conferring the predictions with
<pb facs="4"/>
the events; for the predictions after the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents become histories, and the promises performances.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why <hi>his Maiestie of England</hi> saith (and that most truely) that <hi>the fathers of the first ages, spake of this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter but only by coniectures, wheras we speake of it by experience</hi>; For the prophecies which foretell of an evill to come, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be interpreted by those vpon whom it is come. Even as the <hi>Iewes</hi> being led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues into <hi>Babylon</hi> did easily vnderstande the <hi>prophecie of Ieremie</hi>; so Christians held vnder the <hi>second captivity of Babilon,</hi> may soone know the meaning of the <hi>prophecies</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which foretell of it; I would to God we were not the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our owne miseries, and that we had not learn'd the meaning of these prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by experience. Which makes mee to wonder at our adversaries who to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle this point the more, doe nothing but quote passages out of the fathers, whenas they speake only but by coniecture, or else say such things as our adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do deride, &amp; which experience hath confuted. <hi>Lactantius</hi> in the 25. <hi>chap.</hi> of his 7. <hi>booke</hi> saith that <hi>the world should not last
<pb facs="5"/>
aboue</hi> 200 <hi>yeares more at the most,</hi> and yet notwithstanding it is well neere 1300. yeares past since <hi>Lactantius</hi> wrote. <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Severus</hi> in the <hi>second booke</hi> of his <hi>history</hi> tels vs that <hi>it was generally thought in his time that Nero was not dead, but that hee vvas cured of the vvounde that vvas given him, and that his wound being cured, he is reserved aliue for the last day, to the end that he may exercise the mysterie of iniquity.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> in the 19. Chap. of the 20. book of the cittie of God, expounding S. <hi>Pauls</hi> prophecie, in the 2. Chap. of his 2. Epist. to the <hi>Thess.</hi> speakes thus, <hi>I confesse that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand no thing of all that which hee hath said; only I will relate the divers surmises of men, that I could ever heare of, or read vpon this subiect</hi>; Then he alleages divers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he cals <hi>coniectures.</hi> Compare the booke of Antichrist fathered vpon <hi>S. Austin,</hi> with the expositions of <hi>Andrew</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Bedaes,</hi> and <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> Commentaries vpon <hi>Daniell,</hi> &amp; you shall see but little agreement between them. Wherefore the Iesuits writing vpon this subiect are often times troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout confuting the Fathers opinions. If we then speak with more certaintie thē they,
<pb facs="5"/>
it is not our sufficiency that is the cause thereof, but rather our misfortune to bee reserved till the last daies, that wee might see the execution of the plagues foretold in these prophecies.</p>
   <p>This notwithstanding their praise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines whole vnto them stil: for he which expoundes prophecies not yet accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, ought to be more admired, if amōgst ten false expositions hee hit vpon one or two true, then if after they were fulfilled hee should expound them all truly. Nowe the Fathers doe happily light vpon the true meaning in many of these points, and bring divers expositions, which the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of succeeding ages hath confirmed, which we will produce in their place.</p>
   <p>But heere before wee venter vpon this matter, the faithfull reader must bee advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to avoid two extreames; the one is, that he tie not himselfe too religiously to these things; the other, that he set not too little by them. As for the former, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of England</hi> plainely affirmeth, that <hi>in this doctrine there are obscure things which he would not vrge as necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for every one.</hi> And that with good reason. For I am perswaded that in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb facs="6"/>
religion, there is no one article of faith, which may be necessarie to salvatiō at one time, and yet not necessarie at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now all confesse that the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these prophecies was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before they were fulfilled. It followes therefore that even after their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment a man may bee saved without the knowledge of them. And I finde not that the reading of civill and ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories is recommended vnto vs in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures as necessary to salvation. But so it is that partly out of them, partly out of the present evils, wee draw the meaning of these prophecies. The articles of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of salvation, are no prophecies, but Commandements, or simple and bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; or if it please any one to call the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>resurrection of the flesh,</hi> and of the <hi>life everlasting,</hi> by the names of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; yet are they coucht in such cleere tearmes, that they haue no need of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For God which hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red future events with a thick darkenesse, doth propose the things simply necessary to salvation with great perspicuitie.</p>
   <p>The other extremitie, which is the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too little by these prophecies, hath no
<pb facs="6"/>
lesse danger. For as when the <hi>ruine of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> by <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> did fulfill the <hi>Prophecy of Ieremy</hi>: or when the <hi>birth of our Saviour,</hi> made the prophecies of <hi>Iacob, Esay,</hi> and <hi>Micheas,</hi> plaine, &amp; perspicuous; if any one were so obstinate that he would not vnderstand these prophecies, hee had reiected the grace of God. So now adaies when God hath made vs to see the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of matters foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> whosoever shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon close his eies of set purpose, that man doth resist the wisdome of God, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the holy Ghost of his intēt, making (as much as lies in him) these prophecies to be vnprofitable. For God revealed these things to his Prophets and Apostles to no other end but to profit vs. That so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, which they foretell of, taking effect, wee might not attribute it to our owne wisdome or force, but to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and determination, which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared long before to his Prophets: as also that we might knowe, that these calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being foretold of, come not vpon vs by hap hazard, but by his fixt counsell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved vpon from everlasting, and to the end that we might keepe our selues from
<pb facs="7"/>
being amongst the number of those vpon whome he will powre out the vials of his wrath because of their vnbeliefe. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall labour to prevent the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God denounced by his Prophets will never stile the studie of knowing thē, by the name of curiositie. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie even as the faithfull which lived a little before the birth of our Saviour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted themselues vnder the Roman yoke by meditating vpon the comming of Christ promised by his Prophets which they called, <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.</note>
      <hi>the cōsolatiō of Israel,</hi> so ought wee vnder this Romish bondage, which tyrannizeth over our consciences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vp our selues by these prophecies, part of which being already finished, assure vs that the rest too shall in their due time bee put in execution. Otherwise the reproach wherewith the Iewes were vpbraided by <hi>Ieremie</hi> shall also be cast in our teeth, to wit, <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Ierem.</hi> 8.7</note>
      <hi>that the Storke, the Turtle, the Crane and the Swallow knew their seasons, but the people of God knew not theirs.</hi> For hee iustly sends them to the schoole of beastes, that will not be schollars in the house of God. But if these prophecies be not necessary as articles of our faith, yet at the least are
<pb facs="7"/>
they necessarie as Gods forewarnings to vs ward, which we cannot reiect without hurting our selues, &amp; displeasing him. For is it no fault, trow we, if that after hee hath painted out <hi>the sonne of perdition</hi> vnto vs long time before his comming, we wil nor knowe him then when he is come, &amp; whē we are within his clumbs? The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, should they ever haue foreseen these evils so long time before hand, to the ende that we should not see them when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue? And if we demonstrate, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the predictions of the Prophets, that <hi>man of sinne</hi> must needes bee already come; what carelesnesse is it not to harken out his habitation, and not so much as vouchsafe to looke whether it may not be that we our selues serue him without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it. I omit to tell how the vnderstā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these prophecies, are of great force to giue waight and authoritie to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For the mysterie of godlinesse is made more cleere by beeing opposed to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of iniquitie. Because we are soon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue that the Prophets are true in their doctrines, when wee finde by effect that they speake truth in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. We doe not therfore herein serue
<pb facs="8"/>
our owne curiositie, but the good of the Church, and the commandement of God. Let others read the events of things to come in the Starres, or study Chiromancy, or Meteoposcopie; the best Prognosticke that a man can haue, is the feare of God, &amp; his word, the best booke of predictions, wherein God speakes, as if hee did stretch out his finger from heauen, and point out the <hi>See of Rome</hi> vnto vs, saying, behold her here of whō my Prophets spoke, &amp; which I marked out vnto you in my word.</p>
   <p>It remaines that I speake of the subiect of this booke, &amp; of the end that I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to my selfe therein. I doe not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute who that <hi>Antichrist</hi> should be, nor whether the <hi>Pope</hi> should be so called. And I refraine from doing this for two reasons, The one is, because I would not willingly contest about wordes, but rather tie my selfe to the things. For since all the fathers and our adversaries agree with vs in this, that in the 2. Chap. of the 2. to the <hi>Thessal.</hi> and in the 13. of the <hi>Apocal.</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Antichrist</hi> is pointed out, it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice if we search the meaning of these chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters. For if it be found that they speake of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the difficultie touching the name
<pb facs="8"/>
wil be taken away. We will make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, let who so will drawe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. The other reason is, because this very name doth exasperate the simpler sort who thinking this an odious word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the booke for the titles sake. They thinke that other controversies pricke his <hi>Holynesse</hi> at the throat, but that this cuts his wind pipe. To whose quaint stomacks, and impatient delicacie I thought good to fit my selfe at this time; being content only to shewe the meaning of these holy prophecies, and to confirme my expositiō with proofes: which I hope to deliver so cleerely, and make them so agreeable, that I am perswaded that hee which is resolved not to beleeue any of them, shall at the least wonder by what chaunce it coulde come to passe, that so many things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Daniel,</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iohn</hi> should all meete iointly together in one man. Or how they could draw a picture so like the <hi>Pope,</hi> and never thinke vpon him.</p>
   <p>Now, this being a difficult point, and a matter of importance, I must of necessitie (to handle it with order and care) speake a great deale more in it then <hi>Mounsieur Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effeteau</hi> bindes mee to doe. For seeing hee
<pb facs="9"/>
doth but florish the matter over superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being content to cast some light dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties here and there in the way, it had beene impossible for mee to sound the depth of it in following him. Nevertheles he hath said nothing, to which I doe not answer, as it crosseth my course. God, of his mercy, fil vs with his grace frō aboue, and after the accomplishment of these prophecies which threaten vs, giue vs the accomplishment of his promises.</p>
