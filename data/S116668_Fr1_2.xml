   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is an olde saying (friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that Phylosophers and learned
men agree together like the clocks of
a great citie, which doe seldome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
but for the most part differ, and
vary one from another. This is not
without some colour of trueth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
we must take heed, that
we doe not therefore condemne good Arts and Sciences, either
of vncertainty or of falshood, folly and vanity, as some haue
done. For this were <hi>Solem in crimen vocare, cum lippien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
potiùs oculos tonsori Licinio committeremus.</hi> As if a
bleere-eyed man assaying to reade at mid-day, and finding ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
should lay the fault vpon the Sunne, and not rather seeke
remedy for his ill-affected eyes. <hi>Hominum haec sunt vitia,
non Artium.</hi> These are the faults of men, and not of good
Arts, whose principles and theorems are true, certaine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
catholicke, and full of most cleare, resplendent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
light; as the Poets haue most pithily shadowed in the Fable
of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whom they set forth stealing fire from <hi>Jupiter</hi>
out of heauen. <hi>Ingenia nostra habent suos morbos, quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum
corpora.</hi> Our wits indeed haue their diseases as
well as our bodies: as Phylauty or selfe-loue, Pride, Ambition,
Malice, Hatred, Couetousnesse, Vaineglory: and these as so

and darkening <hi>Prometheus</hi> sparks, the little candle or
light of our mindes, in such sort, as oft times we can not, and
sometimes we will not see the trueth. Books and opinions are
<hi>Mentis pignora &amp; quasi liberi,</hi> as it were the begotten, and
children of our mindes. And what father is there (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
neuer so prudent) who may not be resembled to the
Crow which thinketh her blacke bird the fairest of all other; or
to the Ape who so ouer-loueth her yoong ones, that by colling
she killeth them? It must be a foule and blacke fault which a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or rather a mother will see in her sonne: and it must be a
grosse and palpable errour which a man will acknowledge, if it
be of his owne breeding, brooding, or broching.</p>

      </gap>
by tradition, without any great examination, do labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them in their writings, by shew and colour of reason. But
I must needs confesse, I cannot but greatly wonder at the strange,
vncoth, and vnreasonable Paradox, broched of late in this city,
That the Plague is not contagious. This fantasticke conceit
bringeth to mind that of the Oratour: <hi>Nescio quomodo fiat,
vt nihil tam sit absurdum quod non dicatur &amp; defendatur
ab aliquo Philosophorum.</hi> I know not how it commeth to
passe, that nothing can be spoken so absurdly, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by some of the Philosophers.</p>
   <p>If any one of our coat, should maintaine this monstrous and
pernitious heresie, the Tribe of Physicians would be so farre
from disputing the matter with him, as they would straight
send him that Anticeras to purge his braine with Hellebore.
<hi>Contra principia negantem non est disp<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>tandum.</hi> No ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

the grounds and foundations of Arts.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Plague is thus defined by Physicions <hi>Pestis est mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb facs="3"/>
acutus contagiosus plurimos inter fiens &amp;c.</hi> The pest is
a sharpe contagious disease.<note place="margin">Fracast. lib. 2. cap. 3. de morb. contag. Gal. 1. de diff. feb. cap. 2.</note> So that you see the Plague is placed
by Physicians in that ranke of sharpe diseases, which are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
To this iudgement of <hi>Aescalapius</hi> schoole, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Orators, Poets, and wise men of all ages haue subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
How often doth <hi>Tully</hi> call <hi>Cataline,</hi> and other such like
factious firebrands, <hi>Pestes patriae,</hi> the plagues of their country:
because as the plague spreadeth his poison vpon the bodies of
men: so they infected the mindes of such Citizens as conuersed
with them, with poisonfull and seditious thoughts and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
   <p>Shall the ich, scab, measels, small poxe &amp;c. be acknowledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
catching and infectious, by the experience of euery silly woman;
and shall the plague be esteemed <hi>Animal mansuetum,</hi> an
harmelesse and innocent creature. But they easily reiect the
authorities and reasons of Physicians as Naturians, for so they
call them, and reason thus from the Scriptures. The plague
is called the sword, the hand, the arrow of God, therefore it
commeth not by Contagion, since neither an hand, a sword, or
arrow doth wound by contagion.</p>
   <p>The French disease is called by a great learned man, <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellum
diuinum scortatorum,</hi> Gods whippes sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to scourge whoore-masters. But if any man would heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
conclude that it were not contagious, common experience
would put out his Eies. Therefore these two will well concurre
together, that the <hi>Lues Gallica,</hi> is a punishment inflicted by
God vpon the filthy and beastly sinne of whooredome (which in
this age is counted but a sport) and may be truely called the
hand, the sword, the arrow of God smiting whoore-masters, and
that withall it is catching and infectious, as appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that it commeth not onely by vncleane company, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by the breath or contrectation of the tainted parties, and is
sucked in, from the brest of impure women, by poore infants,
and the nurses themselues giuing sucke to a childe whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were polluted, are oft-times infected. The like may be
said of the Leprosie, which may be also called the hand and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb facs="4"/>
of God, &amp; neuerthelesse is so infectious, that in all well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
common-wealths, the parties tainted therewith, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni
consortio excludantur,</hi> are commanded to dwell apart,
<hi>Non est malum in ciuitate, quod non faciat Dominus.</hi>
There is no euill in the city, which the Lord doth not. It is
therefore a fond conceit, to thinke that to euery particular man
a seuerall plague or arrow is sent, and not rather a generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
whereby one infecteth another. But they argue further.</p>
   <p>That which God inflicteth vpon men by the ministerie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
is not to be reckoned among naturall effects: But the plague
&amp;c. <hi>Psal. 88. 1. Paral. 21. Ezech.</hi> 4. therefore it is not to be
reckoned among naturall effects, and by consequent the plague
is no naturall disease.</p>
   <p>If they will reason firmly, they must adde this word (immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately)
vnto the proposition. And then we will chalenge the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
as faulty and insufficient. It must be confessed that the
angels themselues are not to be reckoned among naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
But what shall let that, by the appointment of God, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
causes should be mooued, and actuated by the angels. Doe
not angels both good and badde mooue and stirre vp the will of
man, though the maner of their workings be secret, and to vs
vnknowen, if not incomprehensible? This is euident by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Achab,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Vid. hist. Achab, Iudae.</note> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> But who will deny that the will of
man is in the number of naturall causes, and principles. And
if the will of man may be inclined and disposed by angels, why
should we thinke that they haue nothing to doe with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes. <hi>Moses</hi> by lifting vp his rod, brought armies of
flies and lice vpon Egypt, raised a terrible haile, smot the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
with malignant vlcers. This was an extraordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Moses,</hi> aswell as of the angels. But shall we therefore
thinke, that the lice and flies came not of putrefaction, the haile
of vapors concret sodenly in the aire, the vlcers by the rotting
of humors. Satan hauing a commission signed from God, by a
mightie tempest of winde blew vp the roofe where <hi>Iobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were. Doth it therefore follow that he vsed no naturall
causes, or is not rather euident that those Princes of the aire, do
<pb facs="4"/>
in a moment stirre vp those naturall impressions? The diuell
casteth the saints into prison, 2. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10. But by Tyrants
and enemies of the church. In the 6. chap. The pale horse, on
whom death sitteth as the horseman, receiueth power to kill,
by sword, famine, wilde beasts. Why shall we suppose that he
vsed not naturall matter in bringing the plague and famine, as
well as in sending wilde beasts or the sword, which are naturall
instruments. Afterward in the 4. chap. The angels haue
charge to restraine the foure windes that they hurt not the
earth or sea. Whereupon it followeth that vpon the Lords
command they are likewise turned loose, and bring with them
diuers affections and mutations of the aire, and especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
seminaries. It is apparant that the diuell (who being a
spirit, and of long continuance and experience, must needs be a
great Naturian) reacheth to certaine witches called <hi>Venefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi>
diuers strong and vnknowne poysons: whereby those wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
creatures worke much mischiefe. Againe, if no naturall
causes did concurre in the pest, then could no naturall remedies
ease it, much lesse cure it. But experience leadeth vs that both
these are vntrue. We deny not but that the angels are vsed
as instruments &amp; ministers to inflict this iudgement and plague
of the plague for the sinnes of men, neither that this disease
hath in it <hi>Diuinum quid,</hi> a secret and hidden nature, so that
we may iustly with the inchanters of Egypt acknowledge it the
finger of God, yet we thinke it as absurd to affirme that there
commeth no plague, but by the stroke and ministery of angels,
as if a man should contend, that there was neuer any haile, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
thunder, proceeding from naturall causes, because we
read, that great hailes, stormes and windes haue beene raised
by the ministery of angels. Historians report, that an old
arke or monument being opened in Babylon, there exhaled out
of it, so pernitious and infectious a spirit or breath, that propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the plague euen to the remote Parthians. And in the
time of <hi>Marcus</hi> the Emperour, the souldiers of <hi>Auidius
Cassius,</hi> digging into an ancient sepulchre in hope of golde,
which had not beene touched for many hundred yeeres, there
<pb facs="5"/>
followed instantly a huge and fearefull mortalitie. <hi>Iulius Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequeus</hi>
reporteth, that <hi>Aetna</hi> casting smoke and fire in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
did exanimate and kill the fishes of the sea adioyning,
which the Liparenses certaine Ilanders feeding vpon greedily,
brought a greeuous pestilence among them. <hi>Orosius, Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,
Augustine de ciuit. Dei,</hi> and <hi>Liuie lib.</hi> 9. make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of prodigious swarmes of Locusts in Africa, which lying
dead vpon the shores, and corrupting the aire, bred such a pest,
as consumed in the sole kingdome of <hi>Masinissa,</hi> 80000. and
many more in the adiacent Countries, and in <hi>Vtica,</hi> of 3000.
men, 10. onely suruiued.</p>
   <p>This may be sufficient to shew that the plague is not alwaies
the immediat stroke of angels. <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that vpon a
dearth in his time, wherein the poorer sort of people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to feed vpon roots, acornes, with other more vnhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and corrupted aliments, there insued a great mortalitie.
The vlcers &amp; botches which are thrust out by nature, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall
heat, the drought, the restlesnesse, with many other
symptomes and accidents of feuers, doe proclaime this affliction
a naturall maladie. It hath beene obserued in this last morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
among vs (the wounds whereof are yet fresh and bleeding)
that women haue passed thorow the pikes more easily &amp; happily
than men. So that this hath bene called The womens yere; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is thought that for one woman, 6. or 10. men haue died.
We must not therefore thinke,<note place="margin">The like may be said of children who haue died in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thē being weak and not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the disease.</note> that either the Angell is partial
in sparing them, or their sins lesse hainous or notorious than the
sinnes of men. The reason hereof (as Physicians haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
is because they haue beene more tractable and easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to keepe themselues warme, to keepe house and bed:
and by these meanes (their bodies being likewise more soft, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and perspirable) haue spent by sweating and insensible
transpiration the venimous matter of the Plague; giuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
more speedy passage to that enemy of life, from the heart and
other noble parts: Whereas men for the most part being ill
house-doues, accustomed to stirring and motion, haue beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnruly and inobsequent to the counsell of their Physicians,
<pb facs="5"/>
and by exposing themselues to the aire, haue loked in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
guest, to whom they should rather haue made a golden
bridge. It hath beene likewise obserued, that this Epidemicall
disease hath had as his beginning, so his increment, state, and
declination, and that it is now (for it walketh still amongst vs
in corners) nothing so acute, violent and peremptory for the
most part, neither so contagious and pernitious, as it was in the
State and Strength. Some haue had the plague twise or thrise
this yeere: but if it came only by the Angell, he might vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
say with him, Let me strike once, and I will not strike the
second time. Secession and departing the city hath beene que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse
a meane to preserue many; as appeareth euidently in
that a small handfull among those great numbers who haue
stepped aside, haue fallen by this sicknesse in the Countrey, and
those carrying with them from hence the seminaries thereof, in
comparison of those huge multitudes which haue died in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And could not the Angell haue found them out, as well in
the Countreys as in <hi>London?</hi> Againe, diuers families vpon
their returne, being safe in the Countrey, haue beene presently
visited, &amp; emptied. Shall we imagine that the punishing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
stayed their retiring, and had no commission to deale with
them out of the City? and not rather thinke, that the aire of the
City being tainted, &amp; their bodies disposed to receiue infection,
this euill hath seized vpon them? If we looke into the city, we
shall finde that in Cheap-side and other open and large streets,<note place="margin">Remember the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable crie in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues parish in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke.</note>
and in faire, roomy, and spacious houses the Pest hath not set
in such sure footing, nor made such hauocke, as in narrow lanes,
allies, and other pestered and noisome corners, where families of
poore people are thronged together, as men vse to packe wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks
one vpon another, so that one of them can scarse breathe
beside his fellowes face. Shall we imagine, that faire and ample
streets, that sweet and goodly houses are priuiledged from the
stroke of the Angell, or from the arrowes of the Almighty, more
than poore and smoakie Cottages? Are not such places as full
fraught and replenished with sinnes of all sorts crying to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for vengeance, as those low and base Cabbins of simple and
<pb facs="6"/>
miserable creatures? I am not ignorant how ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men argue (as they suppose) strongly against all these
things. If the Plague proceed from naturall causes, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the aire, then all persons without exception, who liue and
and breathe in the corrupted aire, must needs be poisoned and
infected: which all men know to be vntrue. But Reason it selfe
will easily teach vs the inconsequence of this argument: for who
knoweth not, that one and the same cause doth not alwayes
worke alike, and that effects are varied according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and diuersity of the suffering matters and obiects. The same
Sunne hardeneth the clay, and mollifieth the waxe: one and
the same Northern winde doth not pinch and pierce all bodies
with the like coldnesse. If we should grant that all mens bodies
were alike disposed to receiue the infected aire (which is most
false) yet there may be many causes why the like effect should
not follow in them all. As (to make it plaine) because one man
hath carefully vsed some soueraigne and apposit Preseruatiue,
another hath neglected or contemned all such courses; and as
bolde and blinde bayard rushed vpon all dangers: another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little touched or tainted, hath straightway sent for, or
consulted with a learned Physician, and taken a conuenient and
rationall medicine: another either scorneth and refuseth Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
and Physicke, or els sendeth to the Physician, when the
bell is ready to toll for him, and when the steed is stollen begins
to shut the stable doore.</p>
   <p>But beside and aboue all this, we must know that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath an ouerruling hand, whereby he doth guide and
direct naturall causes and effects, and heereupon it commeth to
passe, that Contagion though neuer so strong, cannot seaze on
all though neuer so much disposed and exposed thereunto. All
men are not poysoned that drinke poyson;<note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> nor all killed with the
sword or shot, that goe to warre.<note place="margin">Marc. 18.</note> And yet poyson is lethall, and
the sword deuoureth as well one as another. Therefore to argue
that diuers Physicians, Nurs-keepers and Surgeons, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
about sicke persons, are not tainted at all, therefore there
is no contagion in the Pest, is all one as if a man should reason
<pb facs="6"/>
thus, that the poyson of the viper were not deadly, because the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> being bitten by a viper, had no harme, or that
the sword is no deuourer,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 5.</note> because <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> being strongly
belaid, and crying to the Lord, was deliuered and passed with
his life. I haue cursorily runne ouer these things, because the
argument hath beene more largely handled of late by a iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diuine, and the opinion hath beene since that time some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
minsed, and qualified; how substantially and clarke-like
I will not now stand to discusse. Onely I thought meet (because
this conceit is not onely erroneous, but dangerous and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the weale-publicke, and being too grossely broched at the
first, hath left a deepe impression in the mindes of the vulgar
sort, who are as the Oratour saith, <hi>Pluma ipsa leuiores,</hi> as
light as feathers, tossed to and fro with euery blast of vaine,
ann idle heads, briefly to touch it by the way, <hi>Tanquam aliud
agens.</hi> It remaineth, that acknowledging the pests, contagion,
we notwithstanding (who are Christians) carefully auoid that
faithlesse and Paganish fearefulnesse, whereby we are made
to breake all the bonds of Religion, Consanguinitie, Alliance,
friendship and pollicie: the husband forsaking and abandoning
his deare wife, the parents leauing their children to sinke or
swimme, the Pastor exposing his flocke to euery deuouring
woolfe, and the Magistrate his people vnder his charge to all
confusion and disorder. We are apt to rush into extremities.
This were <hi>Incidere in Scyllam,</hi> whilest we would <hi>Charib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim
vitare,</hi> to auoid one euill, and commit as great, or greater
mischiefe. As he is to be esteemed a good subiect and citizen,
who though he will not intrude into euery fray made by despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Ruffians, with whom he hath nothing to doe, least he catch
a broken pate, or woorse turne, yet will boldly enter the battell
against the enimie of his Countrey when he is thereto called by
his Prince, though with euident hazard of his life: so he is to
be reputed a grounded &amp; discrete Christian, who as he will not
rush rashly into euery infected and visited house without iust
cause, warrant or calling, so when he is called, or tied by any
bond of Piety, Nature, or Policy, he will not forsake his station,
<pb facs="7"/>
or detract and forslow any duty or office, though the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof be with euident danger of health, goods or life it
selfe. For in these cases we may confidently expect a protection
from Heauen, and say with <hi>Hester,</hi> If I die, I die. If we fall,
we shall fall in, and not out of our way, wherein the Lord of
heauen guide vs by his good spirit of wisedome, till we come to
the end thereof, which is the saluation of our Souls.</p>
   <p>Now to returne to our Amulets, from whom by occasion we
haue made ouerlong a digression: as I gaue at the first a briefe
aduertisement concerning them, without any euill intention to
wound any particular man in his credit, (no not if I had beene
able, as I am not) so I haue reioyned not in any contentious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but in a desire to be satisfied if I erre, and reformed in
my iudgement. I must needs acknowledge, that considering the
obiect of my Profession, which is that short Epitome of the
grand world, that wonder and Miracle of Nature, that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the holy Ghost, that Lord of the inferiour creatures,
Man, I haue bene very scrupulous (if not superstitious in) vsing
any doubtfull, suspitious, or dangerous Medicine whereof
I haue not beene well and thoroughly perswaded. If any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this to be <hi>Contentio de lana caprina aut asini vmbra,</hi>
too base and meane a toy or trifle to be stood vpon, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēber
that it is made no base dredge, but a noble, catholike, &amp;
diuine Medicine, by the Authors and commenders thereof. He
may likewise call to minde, that the most precious Balmes, and
soueraigne Antidots, &amp; (which is more, Physicke herselfe, that
noble science, is esteemed no better by many than a meere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle.
Besides this, if the greatest, learnedest, and complet
Prince of Europe, haue vouchsafed of late to stoope so low as
to take vp (though to throw away againe) that base, strange,
ill-sauouring weede, or rather intoxicating poison <hi>Tobacco,</hi>
discoursing thereof so learnedly, iudicially, and admirably, as
he may seeme to haue beene brought vp all his life, at the feet of
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and not exercised from his birth, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of great States and Kingdomes, it can be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
for me, who am <hi>infimus è plebe,</hi> to spend some
<pb facs="7"/>
few spare houres in the examination of these Amulets. Wherin,
if I haue failed, and slipped now and then, (as I feare I haue too
often) impute it I pray thee (friendly Reader) to my manifold
auocations and distractions in this heauy, dolefull, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
time of visitation:
<q>
         <l>Da mihi Maeoniden &amp; tot circumspice Casus</l>
         <l>Ingenium tantis excidet omne malis.</l>
      </q>
The Lord of his infinit goodnesse continue and perfect his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
worke of mercy toward vs, in remoouing wholy this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
contagious, and fearefull Plague, putting vp his sword
altogether into the sheath; and restoring vnto vs the daies
of Health and Comfort, that we being schooled by
these afflictions, may euery one of vs breake off
our sinnes by compassion to the poore, and
putting away the wickednesse that is
in our hands, serue him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and righteousnesse
all the daies of
our life.</p>
