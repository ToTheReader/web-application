      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW hard an enterprise it is in this skilfull and curious age to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our priuate labours to the publike view, mine owne disabilitie, and others hard successe doe too well assure me: and were it not for that loue I beare to the true louers of musicke, I had concealde these my first fruits, which how they will thriue with your taste I know not, howsoeuer the greater part of them might haue been ripe inough by their age. The Courtly iudgement I hope will not be seuere against them, being it selfe a party, and those sweet springs of humanity (I meane our two famous Vniuersities) wil entertain them for his sake, whome they haue already grac't, and as it were enfranchisd in the ingenuous profession of Musicke, which from my childhoode I haue euer aymed at, sundry times leauing my natiue countrey, the better to attain so excellent a science. About sixteene yeeres past, I trauelled the chiefest parts of France, a nation furnisht with great variety of Musicke: But lately, being of a more confirmed iudgement, I bent my course toward the famous prouinces of Germany, where I founde both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent masters, and most honorable Patrons of Musicke: Namely, those two mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this age for vertue and magnificence, <hi>Henry Iulio</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and learned <hi>Maritius Lantzgraue</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> of whose princely vertues and fauors towards me I can neuer speake sufficientlie. Neither can I forget the kindnes of <hi>Alexandro Horologio,</hi> a right learned master of Musicke, seruant to the royal Prince the <hi>Lantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and <hi>Gregorio Howet</hi> Lutenist to the magnificent Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> both whome I name as well for their loue to me, as also for their excellency in their faculties. Thus hauing spent some moneths in <hi>Germany,</hi> to my great admiration of that worthy country, I past ouer the Alpes into <hi>Italy,</hi> where I founde the Cities fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht with all good Artes but especiallie Musicke. What fauour and estimation I had in <hi>Venice, Padua, Genoa, Ferrara, Florence,</hi> &amp; diuers other places I willingly suppresse, least I should any way seeme partiall in mine owne indeuours. Yet can I not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the great content I found in the proferd amity of the most famous <hi>Luca Maren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zio,</hi> whose sundry letters I receiued from Rome, and one of them, because it is but short, I haue thought good to set downe, not thinking it any disgrace to be proud of the iudgement of so excellent a man.</p>
