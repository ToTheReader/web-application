      <salute>Right Reverend, and my
Honourable good Lord,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE certaine hopes, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Smith, our Founder of
blessed memory, conceaues in
his Statutes of all his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
for the protection of his
College, giues me the meanest
of that Societie some heart to
present these my first, and weake labours to your
Honours Patronage. But more bold I am vpon
your imbred, and vnderived pronenesse to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Scholasticall indeavours, whereof
both the Vniversities, Colleges, Schooles, Libraries,
enriched by your magnificent hand, are daily, and
pregnant arguments. This enlarging of the bowels
of compassion towards learning in these later, and
<pb facs="4"/>
straighter times, as it is a miracle for the rarenesse, so
ought we all of vs both to powre out our praiers to
God for such ample dispensers of this goodnes to
men, as also our vtmost labours with all thankfull
acknowledgment to preserue their memories. And
if my selfe shal cast a mite into this treasurie, pardon
(Right Honourable) a boldnesse that proceeds out
of an amazed esteeme of this your owne, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
quality, as from a most humble devotion to
your everlasting honour, and happinesse.</p>

      <signed>Your Lordships
most humble devoted, GABRIEL RICHARDSON.</signed>
