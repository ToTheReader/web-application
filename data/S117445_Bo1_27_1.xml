      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the eare commeth knowledge,
and therefore it is likelie that
many would profit by Sermons,
if they were taught to heare.
But before they can tell how to
heare, that is, what things to obserue, and the
way to remember them, it is not possible that they
should learne much, though they heare often: for
this I knowe by tryall, euen of those which are
counted amongst the best and auncientest bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in <hi>Londō,</hi> that they might learne more in a
moneth, thā they haue gathered in twenty yeres,
for they vnderstand neither the Lordes Praier,
nor the Creede, nor the ten Commādements, but
<pb facs="325"/>
haue a fewe notes in their heades of some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
that they haue heard, and that is all their
knowledge, except some fewe, which haue kept
the order laide downe in this booke. Therefore
that euery man may bee able not onely to make
a confession of his faith, but to giue a reason of
his faith too, that which I haue preached, here
I haue written, as a Catechisme for hearers to
begin at: Desiring all my brethren, that they
would tell their flockes at the first, that they shall
neuer profite much, vnlesse they record their
Sermons so soone as they are gone, and that
they as Teachers would studie to
deliuer that which is
worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
