   <p>Be pleased to understand, that thorow some oversight at the presse, the foregoing Examples are not orderly placed. Indeed it was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors minde that they should have beene otherwise to wit, 1. 2. 3. and so all the rest, in order one after another, as they are numbred in the booke, and to this end gave direction, but the same was not considered of these who where imployed for the printing, untill it was to late. Now this we thought good to certifie thee of, that so the mistake may be imputed, to the parties deserving it, and not to the Author, who it blamelesse herein.</p>
