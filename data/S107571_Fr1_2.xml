   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording vnto my promes, yovu haue here the residvu of my reply, vnto the Doctors ansvuer. Of the late appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vuhereof, yt vuil not be vneasy to coniecture: yf boeth the distance vuhereby I am remoued from yovu, and the alterations in the place vuhere I remayned, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. In me verely, the cause vuas not: vuhich more then a year agoe, had brovught yt in a maner, to the redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vuhich yt vuas in, vuhen yt began to be printed▪</p>
   <p>But, considering the great enmytie against the cavu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, vuith some displeasure against my self: some vuil (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture) say, that I haue rather need to seek excuse, vuhy I set yt forth at al, then so late. To vuhome I vuould yt vuere ansvuered, that for the cause yt self: I neuer fear, least yt should come to often, into the field. For, althovugh throvugh the pouertie of the defenders thereof, she come neuer so naked and vnarmed: yet the lord hath set such a maiestie in her countenance, that as vuith one of her eyes, she rauisheth into her loue, those vuhich are desirous of the trvuth in this behalf: so vuith the other, she so astonisheth her enemyes, as if they vuere cast into a dead sleap: in such sort, that the stovutest of them, vuhen they come to the fight, can not finde their handes.</p>
   <p>Ʋuhome I admonish, and besech also in gods behalf, that hovusoeuer they haue hetherto, bene ouertaken by the aduersary: they vuould novu at the last vuithdravu
<pb facs="3"/> their foot, and those that haue bene Standerd bearers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, not onely to retyre them selues, but to blovu the retyre also vnto others. Let yt be enovugh for them, to haue stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the truth, least if they run them selues against yt, in sted of thinking that they haue to doe vuith men and vuith vuordes, they meet vuith Chryst him self: at vhome (as at a rok) they shal vurake them selues myserably, vpon vuhome also, yf any come proudly, the same stone vuilfal, and break them al to fitters: to their boeth deepest, and<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 44.</note> moste remediles condemnation. For hovu gloriously soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer men speak of the sun of god: yet they al (no dovut)<note place="margin">

         </gap> Pet. 2. 8</note> rush them selues vpon hym, that rush them selues vpon his vuord. Let them therefore in tyme look vnto yt, that they giue place vnto the rok for the rok vuil giue none to them: and assure them selues, that their heeles vuil sooner ake vuith kicking against the prik, then yt in receyuing their broken and strenghtles resistance. Ʋuhich, as in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the trvuth mainteyned by vs, I propound vnto them: so, yf in buylding vpon this goulden foundation of the church discipline, there hath escaped any stubble or hey of myne: I vuil (god vuilling) not forget the same ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, to be a lavu vnto my self, to bring the first fier, to consume yt vuith.</p>
   <p>Novu vuhen the truth, by this trial, getteth ground: the displeasure against my self, is no sufficient cause, to vuithdravu my hand, from this defence. For, vuhen the compas of our loue tovuards god, must be moten by the thred of our affection tovuards his truth: I see not, hovu I could persvuade my self, to haue to the quantitie of a grain
<pb facs="3"/> of mustard seed, of trvu loue tovuards hym: yf vnto the trvuth laboring and trauailing in this point, I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my simple help. And verily, yt vuere a deintynes and di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licacy vntollerable, yf I should not afourd, the los of a little ease and commoditie vnto that, vuhere vnto my life yt self, yf yt had bene asked, vuas dvu: if I should grudg, to dvuel in another korner of the vuorld for that cavuse, for the vuhich, I ovught to be ready, altogether to depart ovut of yt: finally, yf I should think much, to vuitnes vuith a little ink and paper that, vuhich numbres, in other places, haue alredy vuitnessed vuith their blood.</p>
   <p>Ʋuhereunto serveth, that yt is not the least part of my comfort, that in this vacation from the ministery: the lord hath not suffered me, to be altogether idle: but imployed me if not in griffing and setting, vuhich are the master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuorkes, yet in hedging and ditching abovut the Orchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of his church purchased vuith his moste precious blood.</p>
   <p>Last of al, I assure my self, that the same cavuse vuhich hath brovught this displeasure: is able (yf need be) to set me in favour again. Ʋuherof, I vuould little do vut: if yt might come to ansvuer before them, before vuhome, yt hath bene so vnvuorthely accused. Alcibiades, vuhē one lifted vp his<note place="margin">Euribia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> staf, redy to smyte hym, yf he vuould not hould his peace: trusting vnto the vertvu of the truth, <hi>Smite</hi> (saith he) <hi>so</hi>

      <hi>that yovu hear.</hi> Ʋuhen therefore these humane trvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, being propounded, notvuithstanding al oppositions, by reason of former praeiudices, in the end finde fauour, and haue a resting place: hovu much more, the heavēly trvuth, sanctified and sealed by the blood of the sun of god, shal at
<pb facs="4"/> the lenght haue the gates opened vnto her. I graunt, there is greater resistance vnto this holy trvuth, then vnto other common and humane: but he that is autor and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of al trvuth, dravueth a great deal deeper, vuhen he shooteth forth this arrovu, then vuhen he sendeth forth the other. And thus much for ansvuer to them, vuhich, not misliking the cavuse, may for that ether (in their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment) I stryue against the stream, or els for that I depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue my self of cōmodities, vuhich I might othervuise enioy: esteme my labor, ovut of season.</p>
   <p>Sauing the table, vuhere the greater letter is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: the varietie of letters is the same, and to the same end, vuhich yt vuas in the former part of this book: vuhere the reader may take his direction. Of vuhome, as before I craued prayer, for the lords assistance: so novu I desire, that thankes may be giuen vnto hym, for al that, vuherein he shal vnderstand yt, to haue bene vuith me.</p>
