      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Tabacco</hi> being left in my hands by a gentleman who in his owne particuler had seene great triall of the effects thereof, and as well by priuat conference with men of learning, as by the reading of such authors of credit, who haue reported the strange and woonderfull operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, he was mooued to make
<pb facs="4"/>
knowne vnto all men that which the most part did doubt of, touching the vse &amp; practise thereof, as well in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the smoke of it with the Pipe, the leafe being drie, as in applieng the greene leafe to the cure of many sores and diseases. What he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and giue me in charge (as it were by his last Will) I haue put in execution, and published the same, according to the request of the partie deceased. Which I haue done with more willingnesse, being credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by diuers of good credit, that besides the effects reported by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of the taking of it with the Pipe; it hath cleered the sight in a knight of great Commaundment and Worship: and cured a gentleman that
<pb facs="5"/>
long languished of a Consumption. I doubt not but it hath many other strange vertues which are yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. But these that are alreadie approoued, I doe recommend vnto thy view and vse; and so do I wish thee all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
