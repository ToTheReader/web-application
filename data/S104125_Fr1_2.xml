The reason is good that it should be so. For first, we haue come to our handes, vse and iudgement, whatsoeuer either autique or moderne Authors haue left behinde.

Lastly, the meanes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, aswell out of the vniuersities, as in them, haue been and are so many and so good, to attaine to all knowledge, that I dare be bold to say, <hi>England</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with any Nation for number of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and for variety in professions. Of late a man of good merit, named <hi>Tho.

Wherein whosoeuer bestoweth time &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to read, with a temperate and sober spirit, I doubt not but they shall be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all such points, as this Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician pretendeth to handle. His stile is not to be plausible, considering the subiect or matter whereof he discourseth, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine him, both to tearmes of Art, and phrases consonant. But for his order and facility (such as a profession of this nature will beare) better to be conceiued, than some (none dispraised) that haue written of the like argument. It is not vnlike, but he would (if God had spared him longer life) haue held on as he began, to set forth for the common good of his and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diuers necessary works.
