      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader: this short Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme, thus gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and set downe for the helpe of the ignorant, cannot bee called new, but renewed for their sakes. For, I may say in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> case as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> said in a like case: <hi>What is that that hath beene? that that shall be.
<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.9.</note> And what is that that hath beene done? that that shall be done: and there is no new thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="217"/>the Sunne.</hi> The portion of meate which is heere offered to the tasle of the simple, is no other then that which he hath already tasted of, if he haue tasted any thing of the things of God: and it is but the substance of other Catechismes set before him in another kinde of seruice, that is, with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Cookery and dressing. which, (considering our too great distaste with one kinde of meate, though neuer so wholsome, if wee be continuallie fedde withit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diuersitie) may not be without some good vse, at least for some short time. For, the affections of men stand no lesse diuersly affected towards the variety of Gods gifts, in deliuering one and the same matter, then doth the stomacke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the dressing of one and the same kinde of meate in a diuers maner, by some alteration of forme
<pb facs="217"/>and manner of doing it. And yet it is no part of my meaning to hold vp the market of nouelty by any schey-seruice as tendeth rather to tikle the eare then to satisfie the sounder iudgement: or to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for those who make books like to the apparell which they weare, and fashions that they are weary of, when a newer comes. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, hauing taught these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (most of them) to a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately; and finding it more easie to print them then to write them, for the surer keeping of them in their memories, who had learned them, and the good of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that desired them; I was not vnwilling thus to giue them content by the benefit of the Presse and of Printing. Neither haue I done this far any want: for there is store of Catechismes abroad: to which this worme of mine, is no
<pb facs="218"/>way comparable: and God hath dealt mercifully with our age for the meanes of knowledge; but we famish spiritually at the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of these meanes, either by not vsing them at all, or not as wee should. This mite of instructions I could haue made much larger but that I considered in my Cruse of store the vessels that I had to fill,
<note place="margin">King. 4.4.6.</note> which could not well receiue more, and so left pouring, as I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their filling. Accept therefore (Reader) what is heere offered to thy gentlenesse, and take it in as good part as it is meant vnto thee. And so, I command thee and thy grouth in godlinesse to the grace and assistance of Al-mighty God: and rest,</p>
