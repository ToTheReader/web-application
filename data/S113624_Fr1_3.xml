      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I haue héere published the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Myrrour of Knighthoode, to the end that I might both satisfie thy desire, and yeelde vnto thée the delight, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof thou mayst receiue. About the veritie of the historie I will not contend, neither would I wish thée to bée more curious to inquire, then thou wouldest be desirous to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ift the truth of each trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation in the Metamorphosis of <hi>Ouid,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uerie tale in the works of <hi>Aesope</hi>: but to consider, that as the one by the transformation of reasonable creatures into sundrie brutishe shapes, shadowed the deformitie of their wicked liues: and the other by the manner of his beastes figured the beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uiour of all the estates of men, wishing a reformation of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uill, and a confirmation of the good: So our Author hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly compiled this present worke, as well to animate these that are by nature forward vnto the exercise of armes, for to exalt their fame: as also to prouoke them that haue hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to slept in the bedde of securitie, to shunne their wonted sloth, with desire rather honourablie to loose their liues in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of equitie, then shamefully to liue with perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie. And whereas there are some so stoycall to contemne the reading of historyes, alleadging that their vaine delight withdrawe manie from other vertuous studies. I answere, that in anie matter where vice is reprehended, vertue is no waie hindered, and although I must néedes confesse, that the learned workes of the liberall sciences are principallye to be preferred, so it cannot be denyed but that the pleasaunt stile of a well penned historie, is as it were a whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stone to the minde, being almost dulled with continuall studie: and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb facs="4"/>
there shall (peraduenture) want the like grace of eloquence in the translation as is requisite, yet I doubt not but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of the matter shall make a sufficient recompence. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer (curteous Reader) I request thée to note, that whereas the beginning of this part followeth not consequently vpon the same booke which was published in the name of the first part, it is not to be imputed to any errour committed in the translation of this second part: for that it is verely the selfe same, that beareth the title of the second part in the Spanish tongue, but the booke that lacketh, is the seconde booke of the first part, which with as much spéede as may be, shall be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therevnto. In the meane time, accept this in good parte, which I now present: wherein thou shalt finde the strange and wonderfull prowesse of the worthy <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and his sonnes, nephewes, kinsmen, and sundry other couragious knights, mixed with many lamentable and sorrowfull histories, together with the redresse of the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged innocents. And so I ende, committing this my labour, to thy curteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and thy selfe to the Almighties tuition.</p>
