      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He busie Bees whose paynes doo neuer misse,</l>
   <l>But toyle their time the winters want to wielde:</l>
   <l>And heape in hiues, the thing that needfull is,</l>
   <l>To feede their flocke till winter bee exilde:</l>
   <l>Somtimes the <hi>Drones</hi> the Hony combes doo eate,</l>
   <l>And so the Bees must starue for want of meate.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>The drowsie <hi>Drones</hi> doo neuer take such toyle,</l>
   <l>But lye at lurch, like men of <hi>Momus</hi> minde:</l>
   <l>Who rudely read and rashly put to foyle,</l>
   <l>What worthy workes, so euer they doo finde:</l>
   <l>Which workes would please the learned sorte full well,</l>
   <l>But <hi>Sicophantes</hi> will neuer cease to swell.</l>
   <l>Though (learnedly) themselues be voyde to write,</l>
   <l>And haue not knowen the height of <hi>Hellicon</hi>:</l>
   <l>Yet, carpingly, they needes must spit their spite,</l>
   <l>Or els their former force, (they iudge) is gon:</l>
   <l>Who only liue, the seelly Bees t'annoy,</l>
   <l>And eate the meate, wheron the Bees should ioy.</l>
   <l>(Depart from hence) that cursed kinde of crew,</l>
   <l>And let this Booke, embrace his earned meede:</l>
   <l>Which was set forth (for others) not for you,</l>
   <l>What likes them best, that only for to reade:</l>
   <l>And let the rest, without rebuke to passe,</l>
   <l>And helpe t'amend the thing that blamelesse was.</l>
   <l>(APPELLES) might suffise, to warne you wel,</l>
   <l>(who) while hee was a paynting in his Shop:</l>
   <l>Came in (a Sowter) who began to swell,</l>
   <l>And viewd his Image all from toe to top:</l>
   <l>And scofte at this, and did mislike at that,</l>
   <l>Of many a fault the Champion gan to chat.</l>
   <l>At length (<hi>Appelles</hi>) angry with his man,</l>
   <l>Dislyked much and gaue him answere so:</l>
   <l>(Talke thou of that, wherin some skill thou can)</l>
   <l>Vnto the slipper (Sowter) only go:</l>
   <l>The saucye (Sowter) was abasshed much,</l>
   <l>And afterward, his talke was nothing such.</l>
   <l>So? (<hi>Momus</hi> thou) no further then thy marke,</l>
   <l>And talke no more, then skill doth giue thee leaue:</l>
   <l>But in thy hart, there is a burning sparke,</l>
   <l>And (whiles thou liues) that sickenesse will thee greaue▪</l>
   <l>But doo thy worst, and doo no more but right,</l>
   <l>The learned route, wil laughe at thy despight.</l>
