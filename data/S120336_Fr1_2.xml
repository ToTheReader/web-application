      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I very well know, that no man (almost) in handling any politique dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, could euer satisfie the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as were skilfull, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
<pb facs="3"/> in the exercising, acting, and managing of such affaires: the one, because they could not vnderstand: the other, for that they were (most what) too curious, neuer regarding any thing more, then the vse thereof for seruing the time present: yet for the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I haue euer borne to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Citie of</hi> London <hi>(wherein I haue had the most part of my liuing and abiding,) and (in particular) to your Honour, and Worships the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gouernours therof (whom I know to be iudicious, yet free from curiosity) I haue aduentured to propound to the world my priuate conceipts touching that subiect. May it please your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Worships therefore (till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grow) to accept these first fruits of my barren-braine, and by your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="3"/> approuing of them, to protect &amp; defend them against the snarlings of blacke-mouth'd</hi> Momists, <hi>who are euer more ready to carpe at other mens writings, then to amend them, or to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any of their owne once to view the light. The matter I borrowed (as you may perceiue) out of the best and most approued Authours and Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: the forme, frame and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worke is mine owne, which (such as it is) together with my best seruices, I commend to your Honour and Worships, and your selues to the grace of God, and so rest,</hi>
