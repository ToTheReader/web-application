   <l>MArch forth with Mars, clap costlets on, ring larum loud apace,</l>
   <l>strike on the drum, sound out the trumpe, defie your foes in face.</l>
   <l>Shake Morpheus of, set Vatia by, flee Bacchus bankets fro,</l>
   <l>shunne Ceres seat, let Venus be, to Mars your seruice shewe.</l>
   <l>In India loiterers were looked to, in Egypt youth were taught,</l>
   <l>and in Lacena idle men, as men suspect were caught.</l>
   <l>With sword &amp; shield, in warlike w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eds the Romains Mars obeyed,</l>
   <l>eche Martial feate the Grekes to Mars, in moūt Olympus plaied.</l>
   <l>Had Pyrrhus prayse bin pend in bookes, had Alexander fame,</l>
   <l>had Phrygia fieldes such fame by blood, had Mars not spred the same?</l>
   <l>Scipio got by Hannibal prayse, by Pompey Cesar fame:</l>
   <l>by Hector stout, Achilles strong, dyd win his noble name.</l>
   <l>What worthie Cyrus gaynd by warres, what noble Ninus wanne,</l>
   <l>that Sardanapalus lost by sloth, euen from thassyrians than.</l>
   <l>What noble courage doth attempt, what haughtie heartes do winne,</l>
   <l>that sluggish mindes do lose againe, as had no conquest binne.</l>
   <l>A cowarde vile, a dastard he, that dares not marche in fielde,</l>
   <l>whom dread of greesly gūne may daunt, to leaue both speare &amp; shield</l>
   <l>What greater glory can be got, what greater prayse be wonne,</l>
   <l>then Curtius feates or Decius deedes, to do as they haue done?</l>

   <l>and Agamemnon wisht againe, to haue but Nestors tenne,</l>
   <l>Whereby that Troy and Ilion proud, by Nestors wisdome wonne,</l>
   <l>and by Zopyrus brought to ground, the pryde of Persia done.</l>
   <l>One subtle Sinon with some sleight, like Lasthenes one to be</l>
   <l>is better then a thousand such, that bragges and bost and flee.</l>
   <l>Then pace this path the tracte is playne, that Riche hath troden out,</l>
   <l>and leades thee lightly to the place, where honour should be sought.</l>
   <l>Sith Riche of right dyd runne this race, and painted forth with pen,</l>
   <l>his trauaill tryed commend you must to Mars and to his men:</l>
   <l>And geue of right to Riche his prayse, that rings the larum bell,</l>
   <l>enroll his name, record his fame, and say to Riche far well.</l>
