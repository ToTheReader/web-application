      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat iust cause there is, that all spiritual sheepeherdes, and especially these of our time, should see carefully to the feeding of the flockes committed to their charge: may easily appeare to him that shal but a litle stay his consideration vpon this matter. For first, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of the Almightie touching this thing are verie earnest, the authoritie of whiche shoulde greatly inforce. Secondly, the rewardes which hee proposeth to vigilant and carefull pastours are large and bountiful, the sweetenesse of which should muche allure. Thirdly, the plagues and heauie iudgementes whiche hee denounceth against slouthful and carelesse shepeheards are grieuous and importable, the terrour whereof shoulde make afraide. Then the nature and condition of the sheepe ouer whom they watche, the vigilancie of the wolfe againste whome they watche, the conscience in taking the fleece for whiche they watche, and this time and age wherein they watche being rightly considered, will giue them to vnderstand suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that they haue good occasion to watch.

Sheepe also of that nature they are, that being carefully fed and discreetely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they proue gentle and louing towardes their sheepherds, and seruiceable towards the chief sheepherd Iesus Christ: but being neglected &amp; left to thē selues, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into bloudie wolues, watching euer opportunitie whē they may rent in peeces their sheepherds, and all other sheepe which are not degenerated into their woluishe nature. As for the spirituall wolfe against whom they watch, which is <hi>Satan, He,</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Peter witnesseth, 2. Epistle, cap. 5.) <hi>Neuer resteth, but as a roaring Lyon, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>

God by his Prophet Ezechiel cap. 34. saith, <hi>Woe be vnto the sheepherds of Israel that feede themselues: should not the sheepherdes feede the flockes?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ezech. 32.</note>
      <hi>ye eate the fatte, and ye cloathe you with the wooll: ye kill them that are fedde, but ye feede not the sheepe.</hi> This sentence should awake the sleepie and carelesse consciences of many sheepherds. For as the priest that serueth the altar, is worthie to liue vpon the offeringes: and the souldier that ventereth, is worthie his wages: and the husbandman that toyleth, is worthie the haruest: and the sheepheard that feedeth the flocke, is worthie to be fedde with the milke, and cloathed with the wooll: so ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nlesse, the priest that serueth not, is worthie no offerings: the souldier that fighteth not, is worthie no wages: the husbandman that loytereth, is worthie of weedes: and the sheepherd that feedeth not, can with no good consciēce require either the milke or the fleece: but his due rewarde and iust recompence is punishment, for that through his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault the sheepe are hunger-sterued and destroyed of the wolfe. But let the ministers of our time well weighe the condition and manner of the time, and then no doubt, they shall see that it is highe time to bestyrre them to the doing of their dueties. This time succedeth a time, wherein was extreame famine of all spiritual foode, so that the sheepe of this time can neuer recouer themselues of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat feeblenesse whereinto they were brought, but by some great and extraordinarie diligence. This time succedeth a time, wherein the multitude of wolues and rauenous beastes was so great, and their rage, and furie so fell in euery sheepfolde, that the good sheepherdes were either put to flight, or pitifully murth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>red: so that the sheepe being committed to wolues, did either perish, or degenerate into wolues: so that to regenerate them againe into sheepe, requireth no small labour. The Churche in this time is like lande that hath lyen (time out of minde,) vnmanured, vncompassed, vntilled, by reason whereof it is so out of harte, that it requireth armes of yron, and legges of brasse to recouer it againe: or like a ship soworne with windes and tempests, so rente with rockes, so crackt and vtterly decayed, that it seemeth a rare peece of cunning to make her take the seas againe.

then but the ministerie of this time, if there be any loue or feare of God in them, if they would not haue all things run to ruine, if they regard either God, themselues, or their brethrē, must forthwith without further delay set thē selues to feede their flocks, to teach, to exhorte, to strengthē, to binde vp, to builde, to plant, to water, to set, to graffe, to leaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vndone that apperteineth to the feeding &amp; fatting of the Lords flocks, to the plāting of the Lords Paradise, tilling of the Lords husbandrie, dressing of the Lords vineyarde, raising and rearing vp of the Lordes Temple. What great want there is in many, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their dueties in this behalfe, is verie lamentable, and by some meanes (as muche as is possible) to be supplied and remedied, rather than to be made a common theame and argument of railing, whiche at this day many doe. Wherein they shewe them selues like vnto those, whiche finde faulte at other mens garmentes, not for that they loue them, or minde to giue thē better: but for that they are proude of their owne, &amp; would scornefully shame and vexe other. The cause of this great want needs not heere to be disputed: but in verie deede, any man may iudge howe vnpossible it was for so populous a kingdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with so many seuerall congregations, to be all furnished with fitte and able pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and that immediatly after such a generall corruption and apostacie from the trueth. For vnlesse they should haue soudenly come from heauen, or been raysed vp miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they coulde not haue been. For the auncient preachers of king Eduardes time some of them died in prison, many perished by fier, many otherwise: many also fled into other countries, of whom some there died and a few returned, which were but as an handful to furnish this whole Realme. The Ʋniuersities were also at the first so infected, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wolfes and foxes crept out, who detested the ministerie, and wrought the contempt of it euerie-where: but verie fewe good sheapherdes came abroade. And whereas since that time, now eighteene yeares, the Vniuersities being wel purged, there was good hope that all the land should haue been ouer-spred, and replenished with able and learned pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: the diuel and corrupt patrones haue taken suche order, that much of that hope is cutte off. For patrones, nowe a dayes, searche not the Vniuersities for a moste fit pastor: but they post vp and downe the countrie for a most gaineful chapman. He that hathe the biggest purse to pay largely, not he that hathe the best gyftes to preache learnedly is presented. The Bishops beare great blame for this matter, and they admitte (say they) vnworthy men. See the craft of sathan, falsly to charge the worthiest pillers of the church with the ruine of the church: to the end that al church-robbers &amp; caterpillers of the Lords vineyard may lie vnespied. There is nothing that procureth the bishops of our time more trouble and displeasure, than that they zealously withstand the couetousnesse of Patrons, in reiecting their vnsufficient clerkes. For it standeth them vpon of al other, that the Churche of God doth prosper, in the decay and fall whereof they can not stande but perishe. But how so euer it commeth to passe, certeine it is, that many are farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde in those gyftes which are necessarie for their function, and small likelyhoode is there yet that the Churche shalbe serued with better, but rather with worse. For it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not, that Patrones here-after wil bate one penie, but rather more and more rayse the market. The case standing thus, their labour surely is not woorst bestowed, neither do they promote the glorie of God, or profite the Church least, whiche to that end applie their endeuour, that the ministerie which now is in place, may come forward, and bee better able to do their dueties: I meane such, as either set forth godly and learned trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, or expositions of the holy scriptures, compiled by themselues in our mother tounge: or else suche as translate the worthie workes of the famous diuines of our time: bothe

these sortes of men, no doubt, do muche aedifie all the godly, and doe greatly helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all those ministers, whiche either not at all, or verie meanely vnderstand the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tounge: so that amongst them are found many, which by painful industrie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reading of suche bookes, doe God good seruice in the Churche, and so might all the rest of them do also if slouth and worldly affaires did not hinder them. Some of that sort complaine, that Caluins maner of writing in his institutions is ouer-deepe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found for them: Musculus also, in his commonplaces is verie scholastical: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of Marlorat vpon Iohn, of Peter Martyr vpon the Iudges, of Gualter vpon the small prophets, and other many are translated and extant, which altogether do handle most points of christian doctrine excellently wel: but this sort of ministers for the most part are so bare bitten of their patrones, that to buy thē al would deeply charge them. Therfore questionlesse, no writer yet in the hands of men can fit thē better, than maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> in these his Decades, who in thē amēdeth much Caluins obscuritie, with singular perspicuitie: &amp; Musculus scholastical subtilitie, with great plainnes &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen popular facilitie. And all those points of christiā doctrine, which are not to be found in one, but hādled in al: Bullinger packeth vp al, &amp; that in good order, in this one booke of smal quantitie. And where as diuerse of the ministerie which lacke knowledge and some also which haue knowledge, but yet lacke order, discretion, memorie, or audacitie, cannot by reason of those wants, either expound or exhort, or otherwise preache, but onely read the order of seruice: the <hi>Decades</hi> of <hi>Maister Bullinger</hi> in this respect may do more good, than shall perhaps at the first be conceiued. For in very deed, this book is a book of Sermons: Sermons in name, and in nature: fit to be read out of the pulpit vnto the simplest and rudest people of this land: the doctrine of them verie plaine, without ostentation, curiositie, perplexitie, vanitie, or supersluitie: verie sound also, without Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, Anabaptisme, Seruetianisme, or any other haeresie: and in number, 80. eueri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> Decade conteining (as the word importeth) tenne: so that they may easily be so diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as there may be for euerie Sunday in the yeare one. Neither is it materiall, what those Phanatical felowes say, which can away with no Homilies or Sermons, be they neuer so sound, pithy, and effectuall to be read in Churches. They are like Physicians, whiche forbid their patients all those meates which they may haue, and would do them good: and appoint them only suche, as by no meanes they can obteine: for it will not yet be, that euery parish shal haue a learned able preacher resident and abyding in it. And in the meane time it cannot be denied, but that an Homilie or sermon penned by some excellent clerk being read plainly, orderly, &amp; distinctly, doth much moue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, doth teach, cōfirme, confute, cōfort, persuade, euen as the same pronounced without the booke, doth. Perhaps some hearers whiche delight more to haue their eyes fed with the preachers action, than their hartes aedified with his sermon, are more moued with a sermon not read: but to a good christian hearer, whose minde is moste occupied on the matter, there is smalods. Better is a good sermon read than none at all. But nothing (say they) must be read in the open congregation, but the verie Canonical scriptures. That rule is somwhat straite &amp; praecise. Then may not either the Creed, called the Apostles creed, or the Nicene creed, or the creed called Athanasius creed, or any prayers, which are not word for word cōteined in the canon of the scriptures, nor any cōtents of chapters be read in the Cōgregatiō. The church &amp; Congregatiō of the Colossians, were inioyned by S. Paul, Col. 4. ve. 16. to read amongst them the Epistle written frō <hi>Laodycea,</hi> which Epistle (as <hi>Caluine</hi> thinketh) was not writen by Paule, but by the church of <hi>Laodycea,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
and sent to Paule, and is not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

The Churche of <hi>Corinth</hi> also, and other churches of the godly, soone after the Apostles times (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of <hi>Eusebius, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. and the writers of the Centuries, <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) did vse to read openly for admonition sake, certeine Epistles of <hi>Clement,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Maister <hi>Bucer</hi> in his notes vpon the communion book in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> time, writeth thus: <hi>It is better, that where there lackes to expounde the scriptures vnto the people, there should bee godly and learned Homilies read vnto them, rather than they should haue no exhortation at al in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the supper.</hi> And a little after, he saith: <hi>there be two fewe Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and too fewe pointes of religion taught in them: when therefore the Lord shal blesse this kingdome with some excellent preachers, let them be cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make moe Homilies of the principal pointes of religion, which may be read to the people, by those pastors that cannot make better themselues.</hi> And that worthie martyr doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> Bishop of London, speaking of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that was in the reigne of king <hi>Edward</hi> (as he is reported by maister <hi>Foxe</hi> in his booke of Actes and Mo: To 2. Pag. 1940.) sayeth thus: <hi>It had also holy and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Homilies in commendation of the principall vertues, which are cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in scripture, and likewise other Homilies against the most pernicious and capital vices, that vse (alas) to reigne in this Churche of Englande.</hi> So long ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as none are read in the Church, but such as are sound, godly, &amp; learned, and fit for the capacitie of the people: and whiles they are not thrust into the Churche for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures, but are read as godly expositions, and interpretations of the same: and whiles they occupie no more time in the church, than that which is vsually left and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after the reading of the Canonical scriptures, to preaching and exhortation: and whiles they are vsed, not to the contempt, derogation, or abandoning of preaching, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to supplie the want of it: no good man can mislike the vse of them, but such contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons as defie all thinges which they deuise not themselues. And if it be saide, there be already good Homilies, and those also authorized, &amp; likewise wholesome expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of sundrie parts of scripture t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the same purpose: I graunt there be so. But store is no sore. And as in meats, which are most deintie, if they come often to the table, we care not for them: so in sermons which are moste excellent, if the same come often to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, they oftentimes please not: others are desired. But, to end: these sermons of maister <hi>Bullingers</hi> are such, as whether they be vsed priuately, or read publiquely: whether of ministers of the word, or other Gods children: certeinely there will be found in them suche light and instruction for the ignorant, such sweetenesse and spiritual comfort for consciences, suche heauenly delightes for soules: that as perfumes, the more they are chafed, the better they smell: and as golden mynes, the deeper ye digge them, the more riches they shewe: so these, the more diligently ye peruse them, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully they will please: and the deeper ye digge with daily studie in their mynes, the more golden matter they will deliuer forth to the glorie of GOD, to whō only be praise for euer and euer, Amen.</p>
