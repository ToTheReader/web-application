      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hers nothing in this small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule presented to your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious view but what you know, nor any thing which can be too well learned: the Priests lips are as well to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and rivet knowledge in the heart, as to tender it to the eare: and the most intelligent must be, for knowledge, as the Suppliant in the Gospell was for Faith, and <hi>cry, and say with teares, Lord</hi> I know, helpe thou my want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb facs="3"/>
Both must endeavour the procuring such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall and saving knowledge, by the power whereof the judgement may be rightly enformed, and the will and affections framed for the well ordering of the life and conversation. Your knowne care and study in this holy practise inviteth and emboldneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Godly acceptance these familiar and ever seasonable meditations: the rather for that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whose late death occasioned the present task, was in her lifetime an afflicted object of your much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and voluntary compassion, many moneths your chargeable and much tendered patient: too late, for her body, in respect of the desperatenes of her malady (the care being yours, but the cure Gods peculiar) but not too soone for her soule, which received no small confessed physick from your counsell, prayers and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. She lived a daughter of <hi>Iob,</hi> her daies being short and painefull: and dying a daughter of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in faith and patience, left nothing fitter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her debt to you then this part of her fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall solemnity; which therefore I am bold to present in her name to your noble desert. Christians care and paines in doing good to all, especially Faiths hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, hath sufficient reward with God: who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding must be glorified by men in the view of
<pb facs="3"/>
his graces shining in his eminent servants: which who so dare performe with flatterie, let him look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: for my part herein sincerity is conduct, as far as my heart and I be best together acquainted. If you, or any for your sake, reape any price of labour in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this publish; I know, God shall not want his praise.</p>
   <p>Prosper still, with your noble consort, as your soules prosper, to your continuing rich in good workes (the Kings high-way to your kingdome.) Be blessed with <hi>Booz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> their blessing, <hi>to do worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and be famous:</hi> and let your famous worthines (as it doth) shine long through your humility heere, till both your graces be late crowned above in Glory,</p>
