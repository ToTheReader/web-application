   <p>The idols have great force to draw idolaters after them. <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.2. <hi>They loved them, they served them, they walked after them, sought after them, and worshipped them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Idolaters are more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in the service of their Idols, than the godly in the service of their God.</note>Observe the five words set downe here to note the earnestnesse of idolaters to follow their idols. First, <hi>They loved them</hi> in their heart. Secondly, <hi>They served them,</hi> there was never a slave that served so servilly, as they served their idols. Thirdly, <hi>They walked after them,</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their responses from them, and trusting in them. Fourthly, <hi>They sought after them</hi> from <hi>Sihor</hi> to <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Fiftly, <hi>They worshiped them,</hi> giving all the glory that was due to God unto them.</p>
   <p>Yee shall not finde in all the Scriptures, such an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire to please God, ye will finde in the Scriptures these things spoken severally of the children of God, and Gods worship; but yee shall not finde them joyned all together, as they are here when they are jointly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of worshiping Idols. First, for the love of God, <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evill. Psal.</hi> 97.10. here is the love of God, but none of the rest. Secondly, the service of God, <hi>and the people served the Lord all the dayes of Ioshua, Iud.</hi> 2.7. Thirdly, for walking after the Lord, as <hi>Noah walked with God, Gen.</hi> 6.9. Fourthly, to seeke him,
<pb n="247" facs="139"/>
      <hi>This is the generation of them that seeke him, that seeke thy face. Psal.</hi> 24.6. Lastly, to worship him. <hi>O come let us worship and bow downe, let us kneele before the Lord our maker.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This idolatrie looseth all naturall bonds;<note place="margin">The idolaters breake all the bonds of nature.</note> against the fift commandement. <hi>They say to the stocke thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the stone thou hast begotten me. Ier.</hi> 2.27. It maketh them not onely to forget their duty towards God, but all their dutie towards their parents;<note place="margin">They brea ke the fift commandement.</note> and as the superstitious Pharisees if they had vowed any thing, they would have suffered their parents to sterue, rather than they would have broken their superstitious vow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5.

   <p>Against the sixt commandement;<note place="margin">They sinne greivously against the sixt.</note> most cruell and barbarous were they when they sacrificed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Moloch</hi> in the valley of <hi>Topheth,</hi> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> called <hi>the valley of slaughter.

   <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Sydonians</hi> worshipped <hi>Ashtaroth.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23.14. and the <hi>Israelites</hi> worshipped that. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 11.33.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Philistims</hi> worshiped <hi>Dagon,</hi> but wee read not that they worshipped that God.</p>

   <p>They worshiped the <hi>Egyptians</hi> calfe.</p>
   <p>They worshiped <hi>Adonis. Ezek.</hi> 8. and <hi>the queene of heaven. Ier.</hi> 7.18. and <hi>Priapus,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.13. and <hi>the hoast of heaven.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 25.5. all these they worshiped. Were they not then <hi>carried after dumbe Idols?</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 91. l. 24.</hi> A comparison betwixt Israel and Judah in their idolatrie, and which of their idolatrie was greatest.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The idolatrie of <hi>Iudah</hi> was greater than the idolatrie of <hi>Israel.</hi>
      </note>FIrst, <hi>Iudahs</hi> sinne was greater than the sinne of <hi>Israel,</hi> although <hi>Israel</hi> sinned continually without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet <hi>Iudahs</hi> idolatrie was greater when he fell to it.</p>
   <p>Secondly, <hi>Iudah</hi> committed idolatrie in the temple of the Lord. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. <hi>Israel</hi> did not so.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iudah</hi> had the true Priests, the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and some good Kings, and the true temple; <hi>Israel</hi> had none of these.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, all the promises of Christ to come were
<pb n="249" facs="140"/> made to <hi>Iudah</hi> and not to <hi>Israel,</hi> therefore <hi>Iudah</hi> did justifie <hi>Samaria</hi> in all her sinnes, the one was <hi>aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and the other was <hi>praevaricatrix.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A comparison betwixt Judah and the idolaters now.</p>
   <p>THe <hi>Israelites</hi> worshiped the golden calfe in <hi>Horeb,</hi> or in <hi>Sinai;</hi> but they bragge that they dwell in <hi>Sion,</hi> and yet worship idols.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the Iewes worshiped a calfe when Christ dwelt but in the bush, cloud, and pillar; but they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship idols now when Christ hath taken on our flesh upon him.</p>
   <p>They worshiped God in the likenesse of an oxe;<note place="margin">Idolatrie now is more dangerous than the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of <hi>Iudah</hi> or <hi>Israel.</hi>
      </note> but now they worship him in the likenesse of a man, more dangerous idolatrie; for man is capable of civill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which a beast is not, which hath some resemblance with spirituall worship; and as <hi>Absolom</hi> in the noonetide of the day lay with his fathers concubines: so doe they now in the sunne-shine of the gospell, when they might have beene cured and would not.</p>
   <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Suetonius lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>22.</hi>
      </note> they have refined all the shifts and excuses of the heathen, so they justifie all their idolatries; and as <hi>Caligula</hi> when he brought the image of <hi>Iupiter Olympus,</hi> he broke off the head of it, and set on his owne image upon it: So they have broken off the old shifts of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and brought in their owne new shifts in place of them, and their idolatrie is refined idolatrie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 93. l. 6.</hi> A comparison betwixt the waters of Sihor and the waters of Euphrates.</p>
   <p>THe scriptures expresseth idolatrie by the terme of <hi>drinking of water,</hi> so bodily whoredome is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

      </note>
      <hi>aquam alienam haurit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>First, let us obserue what resemblance is betwixt <hi>Nilus</hi> and idolatrie; no man can tell directly whence <hi>Nilus</hi> proceedeth, it hath so many springs: so no man can tell directly the beginning of idolatrie, it hath so many springs.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> is blacke and troubled, therefore it is called <hi>Sihor</hi> blacknes: so is idolatrie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled water.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nilus</hi> is unwholesome water for drinke, so is idolatrie.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, <hi>Nilus</hi> parteth it selfe in seaven branches: so did the idolatrie of <hi>Egypt</hi> part it selfe in many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
   <p>Then for <hi>Euphrates. Iosh.</hi> 24.2. <hi>Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the floud in old time, even Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served other Gods.</hi> So when they were carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they sate by the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> then they did sollicite them to worship their idols. <hi>Psal.</hi> 137.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iudah,</hi> because he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated with the Kings of the North, and the South, therefore hee was plagued by them both.</note>
      <hi>Iudah</hi> stood betwixt <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Nilus,</hi> he should have participated with neither of them; but because hee did, hee was both plagued with the king of the North, and the king of the South.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Babylon</hi> stood upon <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Seraiah</hi> to bind a stone to the booke and cast it in the midst of <hi>Euphrates; And thou shalt say, thus shall Babylon sinke and shall not rise from the evill that I will bring upon her. Ier.</hi> 51.63. As the <hi>Egyptians</hi> sunke in the red sea <hi>like a stone. Exod.</hi> 15. and <hi>Babylon</hi> sunke as the stone did sinke in <hi>Euphrates:</hi> So shall spirituall <hi>Babylon bee throwne into the sea like a great milstone, and shall bee found no more at all. Revelat.</hi> 18.21.</p>
   <p>Pag. 119. l. 2.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I am a jealous God.</hi> See how farre the Lord submitteth
<pb n="251" facs="141"/> himselfe to our capacity: First,<note place="margin">God taketh upon him as it were our naturall infirmities and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall passions for our capacity.</note> to take our naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities upon him, as hunger. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.1. <hi>If I were hungry I will not tell thee.</hi> So to take our passions as our anger, greife, sadnesse, furie, wrath, jealousie, and that which seemeth to come nearer to our sinfull passions, as to be froward. <hi>Ps.</hi> 18.26. <hi>With the froward thou wilt shew thy selfe froward.</hi> Whatsoever is spoken of God, it is good in it selfe, although it exceed and become sinfull in us.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 150. l. 35.</hi> Of Jeremiah and Job cursing the day of their birth.</p>
   <p>THese who hold that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> sinned not in those imprecations and curses alledge first,<note place="margin">Some bring reasons to prove that <hi>Ieremia</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not in cursing the day of his birth.</note> that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> before hee began to curse, he praised God. <hi>Ier.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord; for he hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the soule of the poore from the hand of evill doers.</hi> and then hee addeth, <hi>Cursed bee the day wherein I was borne:</hi> this cannot bee a sinfull cursing, <hi>Doth the fountaine send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter water. Iam.</hi> 3.11. Can out of the mouth proceed both blessing and cursing?</p>
   <p>Secondly, when hee useth these curses, God giveth him a comfortable answer; as <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife, and a man of contention to the whole earth.</hi> The Lord answereth him. <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. <hi>Verily it shall be well with thy remnant: verily I will cause the enemie to entreat thee well in the time of evill, and in the time of affliction.</hi> God saith, <hi>It shall bee well with thy remnant,</hi> that is, the rest of thy dayes.</p>
   <p>And they that justifie <hi>Iob</hi> say,<note place="margin">Some say that <hi>Iob</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not in cursing the day of his birth.</note> that <hi>for seaven dayes Iob did hold his peace,</hi> and then <hi>hee opened his mouth and spake; Cap.</hi> 3.1. which phrase the scripture useth, when men speake deliberately and advisedly. As <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Then Peter opened his mouth and said.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb n="252" facs="142"/>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">To <hi>open the mouth and speake,</hi> in the scriptures is to speake deliberately and with advicement.</note>Secondly, they say, would <hi>Iob</hi> or <hi>Ieremiah</hi> curse their mother who bare them? then that woe should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh of. <hi>Cap.</hi> 45.10. <hi>Woe be to him that saith to his father, what beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou? or to the woman, what hast thou brought forth?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, would <hi>Ieremiah</hi> use a sinfull curse against the day of his nativitie, who was sanctified from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe? <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.5.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, how could hee curse that day which was past?</p>
   <p>And where it is objected that wee should rejoyce in tribulation,<note place="margin">Afflictions are not good in themselves, but as they are sanctified of the Lord.</note> and that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> fretted in tribulation. They answere that simplie, tribulations and afflictions are not good in themselves, but they are the wages of sinne; but it is onely the Lord that sanctifieth them, and turnes them to the good of his children.</p>
   <p>And they say, that he cursed not the day it selfe, but the miseries that followed that day, as <hi>David</hi> cursed not the mountaines of <hi>Gilboa</hi> directly; but the blood shed there, which made the mountaines barren; and so it was not the man who brought the newes, whom he cursed, but the miseries themselves, which befell him after that time; and in effect they say it was but such a complaint as <hi>Pauls</hi> was: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this bodie of death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. and he said, <hi>better is the day of death, then the day of ones birth. Ecles.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Pereat dies mortalitatis, ut erumpat dies aeternitatis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The fathers generally stand to justifie him in this, that it was not a sinfull cursing, as <hi>Hierome, Theodoret, Clemens Alexandrinus, Gregorius Nissenus, Cyrillus, Alexandrinus, Origen, Gregorius Magnus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>

   <p>
      <hi>He will not hold him guiltlesse,</hi> that is, hee will punish him.</p>
   <p>We pray dayly that God would pardon us the guilt of our sinnes, and there is no guilt that we are more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto, than to the guilt of our idle speeches and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
   <p>Now that wee may bee freed of this guilt,<note place="margin">How God punisheth the guilt, and how he pardoneth it.</note> wee must consider first, how God punisheth this guilt; secondly, how hee pardoneth this guilt: hee punisheth the guilt when hee imputeth the sinne to the offender, he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the guilt when he transferreth it upon another.</p>
   <p>When he transferreth it upon another, the sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but the guilt is taken away; and some call this concupiscence which remaineth, <hi>materiale in peccato,</hi>
      <note place="margin">What the materiall and what the formall part in sinne.</note> but that which is taken away is <hi>formale,</hi> as the land-marke cast out of the land, it ceaseth to be a land-marke any more, but it ceaseth not to be a stone: and some say the guilt is taken from the person, although not from the sinne it selfe.</p>
   <p>How can the sinne be transferred upon an innocent person to make him undergoe the punishment, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
      </label> who is not guilty?</p>
   <p>The innocent person because he giveth his word for the guilty, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
      </label> and willingly undergoeth the punishment for him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.122. <hi>Sponde pro servo tuo, be surety for thy servant.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.<note place="margin">Christ is punished for us, because he gave his word for us.</note>
      <hi>Iesus made a surety of a better Testament,</hi> therefore he is punished for us.</p>
   <p>And that we may take up this the better, marke how a Iudge proceedeth either according to the rigour of the law, or the mitigation of the law, or contrary to the law, or above the law. According to the rigour of the law, when he imputeth the guilt to all; contrary to the law, if hee should impute the guilt to none;<note place="margin">How a Iudge procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in executing justice.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mittigation of the law when hee speareth
<pb n="254" facs="143"/> some, but this is above the law, that his Son Iesus Christ should undergoe the punishment for us, this commeth of the clemency of the high Iudge.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>David</hi> according to the law executed <hi>Ioab,</hi> contrary to the law killed <hi>Vrijah,</hi> according to the mittigation of the law confined <hi>Shemi,</hi> whereas he might have caused him to be executed; and <hi>Salomon</hi> out of his clemency he spared <hi>Adonijah.</hi>
