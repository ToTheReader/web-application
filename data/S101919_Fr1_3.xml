   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T had beene much
to haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
(if it had so pleased the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits)</hi>
that this worthy
man had survived the publishing of
these, and other his Lectures: for
then, no doubt, they would haue come
forth more refined, and digested; For,
though there was very little or no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="3"/>
in taking them from his mouth,
yet preaching, and writing haue their
severall graces. Things liuened by the
expression of the speaker, sometimes
take well, which after, vpon a mature
review, seeme eyther superfluous, or
flat. And we oft see men, very able
to render their conceipts in writing,
yet not the happiest speakers.</p>
   <p>Yet we, considering not so much what
might haue beene, as what now may be
for the service of the Church, thought
good rather to communicate them
thus, then that they should die with the
Author. He was a man of an exact
judgement, and quicke apprehension,
an acute Reasoner, actiue in good,
choyse in his notions, one who made it
his chiefe ayme to promote the cause
of Christ, and the good of the Church,
<pb facs="3"/>
which moved him to single out argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
answerable, on which he spent
his best thoughts. He was honoured
of <hi>God</hi> to be an instrument of much
good, wherevnto he had advantage
by those eminent places he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto. As he had a short race to
run, so he made speed, and did much
in a little time. Though he was of an
higher elevation, and straine of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
then ordinarie, yet out of loue to
doe good, he could frame his conceits
so, as might sute with ordinary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
A little before his
death (as we were informed by the
Right Honourable the Lord Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>Seale,</hi> in whose pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wisedome, and fidelittie, he put
great repose) he was desirous that
we should pervse what of his was fit
for publique vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>We are not Ignorant, that it is a
thing subject to censure, to seeme
bold, and wittie in another mans
worke, and therefore as little is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
as may be. And we desire the
Reader, rather to take in good part,
that which is intended for publique
good, than to catch at imperfections,
considering they were but taken, as
they fell from him speaking. And we
intreate those, that haue any thing of
his in their hands, that they would
not be hastie, for private respects, to
publish them, till we, whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
put in trust, haue pervsed them.
We purpose (by <hi>Gods</hi> helpe) that
what shall be judged fit, shall come
forth. We send forth these Sermons
of <hi>Gods All-Sufficiencie,</hi> and
<hi>Mans Vprightnes,</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb facs="4"/>
of Grace</hi> first, as being first
prepared by him that had the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
and because, the right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of these points hath a chiefe
influence into a Christian life. The
<hi>LORD</hi> giue a blessing answerable,
and continue still to send forth such
faithfull Labourers into his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</p>
