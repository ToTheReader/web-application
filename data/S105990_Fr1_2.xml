      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O discourse largely of the necessity and vse of this peece of</hi> spirituall armour, <hi>after so many learned and vsefull Treatises, vpon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, may seeme super fluous, especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that there is much spoken to this purpose, for thy satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in the insuing Treatise; wherein, besides the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of the nature of this dutie, (which is</hi> the Saints dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise) <hi>and strong inforcement to it, there is an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to giue satisfaction in the most incident cases, want of clearing whereof is vsually an hindrance to the cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ready performance thereof. In all which, what hath beene done by this Reverend and worthy man, we had rather should appeare in the Treatise it selfe, to thy indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent iudgement, then to bee much in setting downe our owne opinion. This we doubt not of, that, by reason of the spirituall, and convincing manner of handling this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will winne acceptance with many, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that it is of that nature, wherein, though much haue beene spoken, yet much more may be said with good relish to those that haue anie spirituall sense: for it is the most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall action, wherein wee haue nearer communion with</hi> God, <hi>then in anie other holie performance, and whereby it
<pb facs="3"/>
pleaseth</hi> God <hi>to conveigh all good to vs, to the performance whereof Christians finde most backwardnesse, and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, and from thence most deiection of spirit; which also in these times, is most necessarie, wherein, unlesse wee fetch helpe from heaven, this way, wee see the Church and Cause of</hi> God <hi>like to be trampled vnder feete. Onelie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we let these Sermons passe forth as they were delivered by himselfe, in publicke, without taking that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of adding or detracting, which, perhaps, some would haue thought meete: for wee thought it best that his owne meaning should be expressed in his owne words and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, especially considering there is little which perhaps may seeme superfluous <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o some, but may, by Gods blessing, be vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others. It would be a good prevention of manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, in this kinde, if able men would bee perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to publish their owne works in their life time, yet wee thinke it a good service to the Church, when that defect is supplied by giving some life to those things, which otherwise would haue died of themselues. The blessing of these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his we commend vnto</hi> God, <hi>&amp; the benefit of them vnto thee, resting</hi>
