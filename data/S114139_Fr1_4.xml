      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS worke is not intituled (my good
friends) <hi>The L. Marques Idlenes</hi> for
your eies to gaze on, or your minds to be
amazed at, but as (by your leaue) it may
be spoken by antiphrasin, so (by your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
I discouer no monster. In shewing
an vnnaturall generation, happily you
will imagine that Idlenes can bring
foorth no good action, and therefore an vnkinde issue, to be called
by the name of Idlenes. But I answere, though your surmise or
imagination may engender such a report in the life of the <hi>L. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques:</hi>
yet (you see) my conception and deliuery sheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
in that I obserued the former idle time in reading &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
the learned and wise, whose sentences and good saiengs, I so
greatly affected, that I did not onely reade them, but also commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many of them to writing: which being done onely for my owne
recreation and benefite, I assure you (good Readers) was earnestly
requested by diuers my louing friends to make the same more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to the world, by cōmitting it to the presse. In which doing, if I
haue neither done well, nor satisfied your expectation, blame them
that prouoked my euulgation, and deceiued your hope, and yet for
mine own part I wil be excused by the title of my booke, which can
warrant no more to you, than it afoorded to my selfe: which is
enough: if it keepe you onely from idlenes, and yet I wil assure you
something more, for you shall heare many wise, learned, and well
experienced men, which I haue painefully requested to giue you
some aduertisement. And if your fantasies be not ouer curious, or
your minds to scornefull, I doubt not but among so many variable
blossoms, you may happily catch one sauoring flower, if not though
it seemeth to be against all reason, that idlenes can beget some
fruitefull trauell, yet you shall see a greater miracle, which is, that
<hi>The dead liueth.</hi> I meane that they whose carcases are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
many yeeres since, do now as it were, <hi>viua voce,</hi> speake, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise,
counsell, exhort, and reprooue, I assure you. I perused them
to my no smal contentation and delight, not onely to be instructed,
<pb facs="6"/>
but also to the end that idlenes might not attach me, whose great
burden of vanities and suggestions, doth not onely surcharge vs
with the manifolde heape of sin, but also with the lamentable losse
of golden time, for (indeed) the want of some exercise bringeth
vs in open question with the world, and in hazard of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either to be barren of knowledge, or slow of wil: for as the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
his toong cannot be tied (though he oftentimes vtter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies)
so the will of man should not be barren, whereby ill toongs
might be occasioned to take hold: and to say the truth, as we our
selues esteeme not the knife that is rustie, nor account of the trees
that are fruiteles, so we must thinke that if men would not speake
ill of our idlenes, verie Time it selfe passing by our doores without
entertainemet, would accuse our life of sluggishnes, or condemne
our consciences of contempt, and so we may both staine our name,
blemish our creation, and hazard our happie estate, that when
the iudge of all iudges shall heare the crime laide to our charge,
our consciences shall be assured to feele the gilte: therefore the
great stay of mans life requireth labor, first in searching Gods
word to know him, secondly in bending of our endeuors for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of our countrey, last of all by looking into our selues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the great filth which most horribly lieth stinking in mans
life, which for want of purge doth oftentimes smell of hypocrisie,
vngodlines, vncharitablenes, treason, diuelish inuentions and
wicked practizes, whereof sathan hath great store to plant in the
idell soile. Wherfore (my louing friends) I haue done this for my
selfe and for you, and though I haue not set it foorth with profound
learning, fined phrases, or eloquent termes, which are expected
but of wanton eares, yet I pray you allow of me in mine olde plaine
fashion, in the which if I cannot to your contentation make suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
shewe of mine assured good will, pardon my present weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
being vnder the phisitians hands, and I will with
all my hart wish you well, and commend you
to the most highest. Basing this
viij. of Nouember.</p>
