Which kinde of doctrine, forasmuch as no one wryter hath laboured in all poynctes and behalfes more vncorruptely or more playnely to ministre vnto the symple reader, then thys authour by a perpetuall dyscourse and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuacion of the texte doeth: your highnes vndoubtedly in procuring the same

to be turned into English, hath not onely after a most godly sorte bestowed your charges: but also hath in the thingselfe doen vnto the commen weale a benefit by so many degrees surmounting and passing any other act of your great largesse and benignitie, as the soule is better then the body, as spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all edifying is aboue temporal supportacion, as gostly foode and coumforte excedeth corporall reliefe or cherishing, and as heauenly treasours excell all worldely giftes or richesse. And in that your highnesse for the more spedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedicion of your moste godly purpose to bring Goddes woorde to the more light, and to the more clere vnderstanding, distributed this weorke by porci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to sondry translatours, to thentent it might al at once be finished, ife the deuout English readers any long time defrauded of so fruitful and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable a weorke: ye haue therein, moste gracious Ladie, right well declared both how much ye tendre Goddes honour, and also how earnestly ye minde the benefit of your countrey. Whiche your countrey, what they are not able in facte with condigne thankes to requite, dooe and euer will, (as they are moste bounden) supply with perpetuall commending your highnes to God in prayer, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>che I thinke to be the onely rewarde ye looke for or desire. As touching the translacions (because they are of soondry personés dooinges) though there appeare in them some dyuersitie of style and endicting: yet is there in the whole weorke no contrarietie of doctrine. Though euery trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour folow his owne veyne in turning the Laten into Englishe: yet doeth none willingly swerue or dissente from the minde and sence of his autoure. Albeit some goe more nere to the wordes of the lettre, and some vse the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of translating at large, not so precisely binding themselues to the streight interpretacion of euery woorde and sillable, (so the sence be kept:) yet dooe they all agree (euery one as his veyne serueth him) in feithfully rendreing the sence of their booke. So that if any persones there be either of such high conceipte and opinion of themselues that they can like no mannes doinges but their owne, or els of such vinentlenesse that they wil not well interprete simple mennes doynges, whiche themselues can for the moste parte sooner finde faulte withal then emende, or els of such morositie and way wardnes that their stomakes cannot beare with any other mannes labours, be they neuer so honestly entended or bestowed: such are in this behalfe rather to be contemned and left to their insolent dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eignefulnes, then either to be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or aunswered vnto. The partes of deuout readers are, with immortall thankes to receiue and take the fruicion of honest and godly studies: the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of learned men is, without deprauing or derogacyon of other mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, &amp; without any arrogancie on their owne behalfes, to employ their good talentes to the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lique behoufe of their countrey, and to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of godly knowleage: the office of euery studious and diligent writer is, to haue his iye directed so the oublique vtiliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> onely, and than to thinke his vpright wel doinges a sufficiente price &amp; rewarde of themselues, and so without respect of any worldely rewarde or thanke, so referre the fruite and successe of his labours to God the mocioner, the authour, and the weorker of all goodnes. As touching Erasmus and the doctrine that his bookes dooe sowe, although I haue before this time somewhat sayd aswel in my preface vnto your highnes before the paraphrase vpon the ghospel of Luke, as els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: yet can I not omitte thus muche to say in hys defence, that in case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb facs="17"/>
persons bee enemies to Erasmus wryting▪ it procedeth more of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, of their vnquietnes of minde, and of their hatered against the light and grace of the ghospel clerely now arisyng and plenteously spreading it selfe abrode, then of any faute or iust deserte in Erasmus. Whoso wincheth and kiketh at the gospel, in dede cannot but spurne at Erasmus, who hath with incomparable study &amp; trauail shewed himselfe a diligent labourer in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes vineyard. And truely whomesoeuer I perceiue to be an eagre aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Erasmus writinges, I (as my poore iudgemente leadeth me) cannot but suppose the same to be an indurate enemy to the gospel, which Erasmus doeth according to the measure and porcion of his talente feithfully labour to sette foorth and promote. But lyke as whan manne is in a feure, or with any other greuous infirmitie distempered, the better that the drynke is, the wurse it ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>teth in his mouth: so whan the herte is corrupt with malice and hatred of Gods trueth, the better that the doctrine is, the more it offendeth. Sore iyes cannot abide the bryghtenesse of the sunne, nor a corrupte hearte the clere veritie of Gods woorde. Persons indurate are the woorse for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of holy scripture: neyther dooe they of any thing take more occasion of slaundre and offence of conscience, then they dooe of holy scrypture, whereby their conscience shoulde be edified. Some there be of suche malicious hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of herte, that they can abide neither booke, ne teaching, ne reading, ne any thing els, that may helpe or emende the ignoraunt peoples knowlege. And suche, because they woulde lette and stoppe Goddes glory, depraue all good thinges, and pronounce them to be naught. But suche are in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe not to bee passed on, ne to be hearde. For as a body corrupted with yll humours or diseases, the more and better that it is nourished with good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and drinkes, the wurse it is: so a cankarde stomake and a wieked hert, the more holesome doctrine that is ministred vnto it, the more it is indurate, the more doeth it enuie the publique vtilitie vnto men▪ and the more dooeth it striue, and wrastle against the veritie. Pharao was neuer more eagre in persecuting the people of God, thē whan he was by dayly plagues and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles most of all prouoked te conuerte. The Pharisees neuer more furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, swelled, ensourged, or raged against Christ, then whan he alleaged holy scripture vnto them, or brought againste them the testimony of theyr owne lawe which they coulde not deny. The scripture of God is all good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet like as the same to the good spirite is a sure porte of tranquillitie and peace, so is it to the wieked conscience a stumbling blocke, and a stone of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Out of one and the same floure the Bee gathereth honey, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sucketh venome: so great diuersitie of operacion there is in good and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill natures. And the common faulte that malignaunt persones doe allege against the publishing of Goddes worde in the mother tongue, and against the setting foorth of holesome and godly exposicions vpon the same, is, that suche bookes cause sedicion against the doctrine, and than lay their facte to the doctrines charge. This hath euermore hitherto ben the practise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighaunce not only of the Romish Pharisaical sorte, but also of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enemies of Goddes trueth, euen from the beginning. Neither haue this malicious generacyon euer as yet vsed any other way or coulour to deface the trueth, to let the good proceding of Gods worde, or to sliere and prouoke the indygnacyon of Princes and Magistrates agaynste the publishyng, or
<pb n="xvii" facs="17"/>
agaynst the true preachers and teachers therof: but onely by allegeyng that it wyll mooue sedicion and teache errour: where in dede Goddes woorde is (as ye would saye (a perfeicte touchestone whereby to fynde out and to trye suche cancard stomakes, as would fain rebelle &amp; moue sedicion, and would gladly haue it so to bee. For otherwyse a great wonder it were, and a veraie straunge thing, if the woord of God, or this paraphrase, or any other lyke godly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicion of the ghospell (whiche is in sense none other but the doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles) should corrupt the readers or teache errour, or moue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion. God and his moste holy woorde is altogether peace, vnitie, concorde, and perfec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e charitie. Goddes woorde teacheth none other doctrine but peace humilitie, subiection, and so muche obedience to the Princes and Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as the Romishe Babylonians would not by their good willes haue to be put in the heades and hertes of the ignoraunt people. But this colour haue the enemies of Goddes woorde euermore vsed to suppresse the ghospell. So did they by all the Martirs, so haue they doen by the true preachers, so did the olde Iewes by the auncient prophetes of God, and so did y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> old Pharisees by Christ himselfe, whose moste grieuous crymes were, that he drew al the worlde after hym, that he taught and sowed erroneous doctrine, that he seduced the people, and that he made hymselfe a kyng. And the malicious Iewes layed to Paules charge, that he begoonne to be a sedicious moouer of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ceasar: not that the thyng was so in dede, but because thesame was a cockesure waie to make al obedient people hate the ghospell, and to prouoke the rew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ers &amp; Magistrates to suppresse it. But the lorde, who of his mercifull goodnesse hath of late sent out the clere radiaunt sunnebeames of his holye woorde and veritie to shyne ouer all christen regions, will (I trust) so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the light of the same, that the simple flocke shall bee hable to discerne the spirites of men, &amp; liuely to know the vngodly maligners, whiche by cauiling and deprauyng all good thinges, dooe wrastie and strougle (as muche as in them lieth) to kepe the ignoraunte multitude in blidnesse. In the meane time all the simple Englishe congregacion, is bound continually to praye for your highnes, that haue for theyr vse and behoufe procured the translacion of this present paraphrase vpon the ghospell of Mathew, and vpon the residue of the newe testament, wherby they may with a more coumfortable and pleasaunt readyng in theyr owne mother tounge, bothe encreace from daye to daye in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
