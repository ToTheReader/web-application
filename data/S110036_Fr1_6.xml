   <head>¶ The Authour in commendation <hi>of the worthy and renowned Rider,</hi> ROBERT ALEXANDER Knight, deceassed.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>GReat <hi>Alexander</hi> deerely lou'd his Horse,</l>
      <l>The Horse lou'd him, and suffered none to ride</l>
      <l>Vppon his backe, by flattery or by force,</l>
      <l>But his dread Lord, that halfe the world did guide.</l>
      <l>This knight did beare that <hi>Alexanders</hi> name,</l>
      <l>Who brought the proudest Coursers to his becke,</l>
      <l>And with his hand, spurre, voice and wand, did tame</l>
      <l>The stately Steedes that neuer brookt the checke.</l>
      <l>He father was to <hi>Alexanders</hi> three,</l>
      <l>Which are for riding held in high respect:</l>
      <l>As they are highly praisd, admir'd was hee,</l>
      <l>That taught them first those Coursers to correct:</l>
      <l>Not onely he in <hi>England</hi> was esteemd,</l>
      <l>But eeke in forraine Countries for his Art,</l>
      <l>And yet to me (that honourd him) it seem'd</l>
      <l>His fames report was lesse then his desart.</l>
      <l>This knight (the mirrour of all knights for riding)</l>
      <l>Had many men of worth and great renowne</l>
      <l>That were his schollers, by whose happy guiding</l>
      <l>They in this art did put all others downe:</l>
      <l>Ye gentlemen, ye knights, and stately Peares,</l>
      <pb facs="12"/>
      <l>That by his life reap'd profit and delight,</l>
      <l>Come ioyne with me in shedding solemne teares,</l>
      <l>And mourning for the death of this braue knight,</l>
      <l>As Art vnited with Experience long,</l>
      <l>Taught him those lofty Steedes in awe to hold,</l>
      <l>So nature fram'd his bodyfaire and strong,</l>
      <l>And heauen gaue him a sptrit stout and bold:</l>
      <l>To him was I beholding for his loue,</l>
      <l>My labors still were welcome to his sight,</l>
      <l>This stirreth vp my heart, and doth it moue,</l>
      <l>In what I may his friendship to requite.</l>
      <l>In <hi>Fames</hi> sweet breath he liues, yet wants he breath,</l>
      <l>And thus he liues, and yet is lise is donne,</l>
      <l>He rode apace, yet is out-rid by death,</l>
      <l>And still he rides and yet his race is runne:</l>
      <l>He rides indeede, but how? on Angels wings,</l>
      <l>And is new knighted by the King of Kings.</l>
