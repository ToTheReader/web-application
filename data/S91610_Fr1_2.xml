      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ample and deserued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation (which Fame hath blazed ouer all this Kingdom, and more and more shall to your eternall memory) of the ardent zeale that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath vnto Military Discipline, and the vertuously disposed, and of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of them, hath amongst many hearts truely deuoted to your Highnesse in all
<pb facs="3"/> submissiue humilitie, incensed and animated mine (though most vnworthy) to present, offer, and dedicate vnto your Highnesse, this rude, and vnpolished Pamphlet, treating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating the path-way to the youths, and the many vnexpert traine-men of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to lead them to the marke, which is to become perfit and absolute Souldiers. Who (hauing reaped a large haruest of peace vnder the most peacefull Monarch in Europe, your most renowmed Father) are very raw and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant in most points of Militarie Exercise. My long continuance in the warres hath by experience gathered, that it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and requisite, in the Summer of Peace, to forecast and prouide against the Winter of Warres. <hi>Mars</hi> hath long time slumbered, and as <hi>Iosua</hi> commanded the Sunne to stand firme, so our Royall <hi>Iosua,</hi> our Soueraigne King IAMES (whom God protect from outward and domesticall inuasions) with his glorious beames appearing and entring the Confines of this Kingdome hath dispersed the clouds, as well of forreine, as home-bred broyles and dissentions, and established our peace like Mount Sion: Yet tho <hi>Mars</hi> be fettered, I hold
<pb facs="3"/> it (vnder your Highnesse correction) both conuenient, and agreable with the policie of other Nations, that this Common-weale be euer in a readinesse to preuent accidentall, and ensuing dangers, least (wallowing too long in the cradle of Securitie, and <hi>Mars</hi> on a suddaine awaking, and sounding in our eares vnexpected Alarmes) it buy Repentance at too deare a rate. And to register the same in the Tablets of my Country-mens hearts, and for their good, I haue compiled and collected the obseruations and directions in this Booke following; the which I humbly desire may be respected by your Highnesse, not according to the merit of the action, or matter it selfe, but according to the intent and affection of the Agent and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator; and that your Highnesse will imitate herein that great Patron and Patterne of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, who made more account of the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes mite, than of the superfluitie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant treasure of the rich. And thus with my vncessant prayers to the Almighty, the Lord of Hostes, that your Highnesse may daily more and more grow in the fauour of God and Men, and in the practise of all vertuous, pious, and valorous actions, to the aduancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="4"/> the vanquishing of your enemies, and the good of this Common-wealth; crauing pardon for my boldness, I humbly take my leaue, and euer rest with my best endeuors,</p>
