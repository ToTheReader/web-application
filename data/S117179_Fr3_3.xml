   <head>THE TRANSLATOR to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, I haue made bold after this former Treatise yet a while to trouble (or rather to delight) you with this ensuing shorter, yet no lesse zealous, discourse. The neerenesse of both their arguments may in some sort challenge a neerenesse of place, and I hope shall obtaine at your hands a like acceptation. I will say no more: onely giue me leaue to adde this obseruation of Gods conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall watchfulnesse ouer his Church. We haue seene of late what troubles, what broiles, what feares of a generall deua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station haue beene (and it is to be feared are scarce yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) in that our neighbour Country. Many small Treatises and Pamphlets (that were daily througed as it were to the Presse) doe giue hereof a sufficient testimonie: so that wee might in a manner say (as it is in the first chapter of <hi>Iob</hi> often repeated) <hi>Whiles hee was yet speaking,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob 1.</note>
      <hi>another came, and said,</hi> &amp;c. While one booke of bad newes was yet a printing, another came and brought vs worse newes. Whilest the matters of their Common-wealth stand thus, see how God on the other side prouides for his Church, and <hi>daily addes to it such as shall bee saued.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 2.47.</note> Not many moneths since wee haue heard of the happy conuersion of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> one of the Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> and with
<pb facs="36"/>
him of a many likewise that were of his retinue. This newes was scarce downe, but behold this other Treatise comming forth, declaring the conuersion of a Gentleman, though not equall to the former in birth, yet (if wee may beleeue the <hi>Romanists)</hi> as farre aboue him in regeneration, as they esteeme a spirituall vocation to exceede the temporall. And <hi>whiles he was yet speaking, another came,</hi> I meane, whilest this booke (at least the translation thereof) was yet in the Presse, another came, namely this present Declaration of Marquise <hi>Boniuet,</hi> &amp;c. So that wee haue cause still to blesse God for his goodnesse, who though (with those buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Nehemiah) hee hath</hi> for a while <hi>had his sword girded on his loines,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Neh. 4.18.</note> for to strike by way of punishment his people, yet at the same time hee kept in the other hand the hammer and chizell for to square and fit these liuing stones to the building of his spirituall Temple. But what doe I? I must conclude, lest mine obseruation should proue to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the text it selfe. In the meane time accept of that which is done for you, and bee thankfull to God for that which he hath done for his Church: and in particular cease not to pray continually for the peace of the distressed <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> which he hath in <hi>France.</hi> Farewell. </p>
