   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you please to take notice thereof, within this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, you may easily discover the Surgeons Chest three times to be repeated; or rather three severall proportions or explainings of a Surgeons Chest, or of Surgery provisions for Military uses: The first whereof puts the Reader onely in mind, by way of inference, of particular Medicines, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other materials and needfull additaments, usefull for a Surgeons Chest, for Sea or Land, to be provided with▪ as also such necessaries as by the ship Barbers are fit to be had in readinesse. In the second view of the Surgery Chest, is described (and as it were set open to be viewed) a Chest fitted for a great Ship upon a long Voyage for Sea service; as suppose for an East India Voyage. And wherein this second is not sufficiently explained, the first (if you please to repair unto it) shall give you further satisfaction. As for the third proportion, it is a Surgeons Chest epitomized, or a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring proportion, as suppose chiefly ordained for the curing of wounds either with Gun-shot or other casualties, and accidents in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties service for a Voyage on a sudden, to serve upon or near our own Coast, where additions (if occasion be) cannot be wanting in every Port Town. Unto all which proportions as each occasion of use shall urge, relation may be had, in regard each one of them differ in many and divers respects from the other. In which my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, if any of the more sharp witted sparks of the time, I mean any of my younger brethren, shall shew his greater skill, and say, I can yet adde many more needfull particulars, which the Author hath in his nescience omitted; as an acute verball youth did not long since in my hearing, he not knowing me to be the Author: to whom I made a short, though it may be not a respective answer, that a fool could doe as much. For who that hath wit, and is expert in Surgery, can be ignorant, that all medicines that Art hath ever devised or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from the beginning of times for the health of mankind, or can any way be produced for the healing of the bodies of men, the same may be found usefull in a Surgeons Chest; whether the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

be composed by a Chymicall, Methodicall, or Empericall Surgeon, and whether made of an Animall, Vegetable, or a Minerall substance, the Artist may doubtlesse make good use thereof for Sea or Land service in his Chest: but neverthelesse, the Author by way of introduction held it fittest for him to expresse <hi>partem pro toto,</hi> a part for the whole, <hi>(Nam verbum sat sapienti)</hi> leaving just libertie, with room sufficient, for succeeding times to shew their inventions and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as alluding to the wise saying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Aphorismes, <hi>Vita brevis est:</hi> Mans life is short, <hi>Ars long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> est,</hi> Art is long. In which regard the discreet young Artist, that hath time enough before him, is hereby desired to forbear his censure of the weak endeavours of the Author, untill he have effected a better of his own, and more usefull in Surgery, for the Common-wealth.</p>
