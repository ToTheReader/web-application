      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the nature of the trueth be of such force and efficacie, that after it is heard by the spirituall man, it is immediatly beleeued, credited and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced: yet the naturall man is so infirme, &amp; weake, that his beleefe must be supplied by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and euident arguments: Wherefore, many learned and godly men of the primitiue Church, haue gathered out diuers pithie and forcible, natural and philosophical arguments, to proue &amp; confirm the Christian faith thereby: As in the 1. Cor. 15.36. Paul the learned &amp; godly teacher of the Gentiles, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thē to confesse the resurrection of the dead, induceth a maruelous pithie and familiar argument by a naturall comparison of seede sowne in the ground, that first must die and be corrupt in the earth, and then doth it quicken vp and rise againe after an other forme, than it was sown into: And likwise other learned Doctors of the primitiue Church, writing to the Ethnicks, who sturred at the Virgins conception, and at Christes diuinitie, resoneth with them on this maner: saying, Your gods (as ye beleue) hath conuersed with many women among you, and hath begotten many children, who hath wrought no miracles: &amp; how can ye that so beleeue deny vs, that our great God hath begotten one Sonne, in whome diuinitie and humanitie are conjoyned, seeing your eies and forefathers, haue seen so many and diuine miracles wrought by him, &amp; in his name? And so most wisely vsed they these Gentiles, own opinions and arguments against themselues, which mooued the malicious Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour, to discharge from Christians, the Schooles &amp; learning of Philosophie, yeelding the reason, because saith he, <hi>Propriis pennis ferimur,</hi> and as by that means, many of the most learned Gentiles in these daies, were either mooued necessarily to confesse the Christian Religion to be true, pure and holy: or then at the least were made so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, that they were not able to write or teache against it. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, now in this second arising of the Euangelicall trueth, from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Antichristian darknes: it is not ynough that this diuine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation which discouereth, the Antichrist be onely, by simple as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion interpreted, or historically applyed to the confirming of their zeale, that already knowes and detests that man of sinne and sonne of perdition: but also, to the effect the fauorers of his errors, may either be conuerted, or then their mouthes bridled from calumniating the truth, it is needfull that such necessary reasons and sure arguments, or at the least such notable tokens be induced, as may make that interpretation vndenyable. And therefore being of purpose (by the assistance of the
<pb facs="5"/>
Almightie) to expounde and open vp the mysteries of this Revelation by a two-folde discourse, the one Paraphrastical, the other historicall, both confronted together: I haue thought good before that work, to premit by way of introduction, a resoning for the inuestigatiō of the true sense and meaning of euery notable mysterie thereof, and to sette the same in forme of Propositions, as neere the analytick or demonstratiue maner, as the phrase and nature of holy scriptures will permit: and that for the better satisfaction of these Naturalists, of whome happely, God may either make true spirituall professors, or at the least, hereby bridle their opprobrious mouthes from calumniating the vndoubted trueth, when they see the naturall coherence of Gods mysteries so maruelously reuealing one another, that thereby the trueth of God, the history of his Church, and person of the Antichrist are detected, and the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristians induced necessarilie, either to confesse themselues to bee hereby discouered, or then must they deny the scripture it selfe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue but of late attempted, to write this so high a worke, for preuenting the apparant danger of Papistrie arising within this Iland, yet in trueth, it is no fewe yeares since first I beganne to precogitat the same: For in my tender yeares, and barneage in Sanct-Androis at the Schooles, hauing on the one parte contracted a louing familiaritie with a certaine Gentleman, &amp;c. a Papist: And on the other part, being attentiue to the Sermons of that worthie man of God, <hi>Maister Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Goodman,</hi> teaching vpon the Apocalyps, I was so mooued in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, against the blindnes of Papists, that could not most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see their seuen hilled citie Rome, painted out there so liuely by Saint Iohn, as the mother of all spirituall whoredome, that not onely bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted I out in continual reasoning against my said familiar, but also from thenceforth, I determined with my selfe (by the assistance of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) to employ my studie and diligence to search out the remanent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of that holy book: as to this houre (praised be the Lorde) I haue bin doing at al such times, as cōveniently I might haue occasion: But (to confesse the trueth of the infirmitie of man to the glory of God) I found euer during al that long time, more fruit in one houres sobrietie, prayer, and humble meditation, nor in a thousand daies of curious or presumptuous inquisition: yea, the more subtily I searched, the more darknes I found, in so much, as curious inquisition rather discouraged me by finding out of doubts, then profiteth me by finding any resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: And so, when after long time spent, with litle knowledge, I (justly dispairing of mine owne habilitie) became trulie sorrowfull and humble in heart, then it pleaseth God, (to whome be the onely glory) to giue me that grace, to espy in short time, that woonderfull ouerture which in long time before I could not considder: So that then I began to take vp matters by their right beginning, and by most easie grounds, And to prosecute out the rest by their coherence in order, as is here set downe, to the full resolution of all the former doubts. After the which, although (greatly rejoycing in the Lord) I began to write thereof in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:
<pb facs="6"/>
yet, I purposed not to haue set out the same suddenly, and far lesse to haue written the same also in English, til that of late, this new inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Papists arising about the 1588. year of God, and dayly incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing within this <hi>Iland</hi> doth so pitie our hearts, seeing them put more trust in Iesuites and seminarie Priests, then in the true scripturs of God, and in the Pope and King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> then in the King of Kings: that, to preuent the same, I was constrained of compassion, leauing the Latine, to haste out in English this present worke, almost vnripe, that hereby, the simple of this <hi>Iland</hi> may be instructed, the godly confirmed, and the proud and foolish expectations of the wicked beaten downe, purposing hereafter (God willing) to publish shortly, the other latin editiō hereof, to the publike vtilitie of the whol church. Whatsoeuer therfore through hast, is here rudely and in base language set downe, I doubt not to be pardoned thereof by all good men, who considering the necessitie of this time, wil esteeme it more meete, to make hast to preuent the rising againe of Antichristian darknes within this Iland, then to prolong the time in painting of language: Especially also, seeing herein purposely I presse not to follow the particular ornate tearmes, of neither Scottes nor Englishmen: but rather contrarily for both their instructions, I vse so much as I can these wordes and tearmes, that be more common and sensible to them both, then proper or ornate to any one of them. Here then (beloued Reader) thou hast this work deuided into two trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, the first is the said introduction and reasoning, for investigation of the true sense of euery cheife Theological tearme and date contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Reuelation, whereby, not onely is it opened, explained and interpreted, but also that same explanation and interpretation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, confirmed and demonstrated, by euident proofe and coherence of scriptures, agreeable with the euent of histories. The seconde is, the principal treatise, in the which the whole Apocalyps, Chapter by chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Verse by verse, and sentence by sentence, is both Paraphrastically expounded and Historically applyed. This second and principall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, keepeth this order, that first before euery chapter, is premitted the argument, not of the literall sense of the chapter, but of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and interpretation of the same. Thereafter (seeing all the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Apocalyps, doth either describe the vision, or then expresse the prophecie) if the present chapter be descriptiue, euery page thereof is diuided in two columnes: in the first whereof, is set the text by verses, in the second columne, is set the Paraphrasticall exposition, answering verse by verse to the text of the first columne: But if the present chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be prophetical, then is euery page thereof diuided in three colums, the first containeth the Text by verses, the second the Paraphrasticall exposition thereof verse by verse, the third also agreeable therewith by verses, containeth the history or historicall application, in the which, and by the which, the same prophecie is, or shall be performed. And if any chapter is partly descriptiue, partly propheticall, then where it is propheticall, there are three columnes, the first is the Text, the second,
<pb facs="6"/>
is the Paraphrasticall exposition of the text: The third, is the historicall application &amp; accomplishment thereof. But where in that same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any part is descriptiue, then are there forenent that part onely two columnes, whereof the first is the Text, the second is common to both the Paraphrastical columne, &amp; to the historical columne: and therfore it passeth through, occupying the roome of both the second and third columnes, so that when yee read the second columne, ye shall read it with the second columne, and when againe ye read the third columne, yee shall also reade it with the third columne: for it is such a common thing, as agrees to be read with either of them. Furthermore, there is two drawne lines betwixt the Paraphrastical columne and the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, within the which lines there is set downe the dates of times, by seals trumpets, viols, thunders, and years of God, answering to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise time, in the which every Prophecie thereof was or shall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Moreouer, in case any part of the text may be thoght to be wrong translated, any part of the Paraphrase wrong expounded: or finally, any part of the history wrong applied, ouer briefly handled, not sufficiently prooued, or hauing neede of annotations: I haue therefore forenent euery doubtfull and needful place of the Text, Paraphrase, and History, set markes of the ordinary letters of <hi>a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. In the Paraphrase, and after the end of the whole chapter hath subjoyned Notes, Reasons, and Amplifications, marked correspondētly with the like letters of <hi>a b c,</hi> &amp;c. by the which Notes and Amplifications, not onely the breuitie of the Paraphrase and history is supplied, but also by reasons, proofes, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of scripture therein insert, the whol smaller doubts thereof are resolued. And as toward the greter doubts, they are referred to the first treatise, wherein they are at length and demonstratiuely prooued. So the note here in the second treatise, doeth onely quote the proposition of the first treatise, that proues that present assertion. And because this whole work of Reuelation concerneth most the discouerie of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian and Papisticall kingdome, I haue therefore (for remouing of all suspition) in al histories and prophane matters, taken my authorities and cited my places either out of Ethnick auctors, or then papistical writers, whose testimonies by no reason can bee refused against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But in matters of diuinitie, doctrine &amp; interpretation of myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (leauing all opinions of men) I take me onely to the interpretation and discouerie thereof, by coherence of scripture, and godly reasons following thereupon: which also not only no Papist, but euen no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may justly refuse. And forasmuch as our scripturs herein are of two sortes, the one our ordinary text, the other extraordinary citations, In our ordinary text, I follow not altogether the vulgar English translation, but the best learned in the Greek tong, so that (for satisfying the Papists) I differ nothing frō their vulgar text of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> as they cal it, except in such places, where I proue by good reasons, that hee differeth from the Originall Greek. In the extraordinary texts of other scriptures cited by
<pb facs="7"/>
me, I followe euer <hi>Ieromes</hi> latine translation, where any controuersie stands betwixt vs and the Papists, and that moueth me in diuers places to insert his very latine text, for their cause, with the just English there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for supply of the vnlearned. And hereof it commeth that our quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are according to the sections and verses of <hi>Ieromes</hi> translation, printed in Antwerpe by <hi>Plantine,</hi> agreeing also with the great concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances of <hi>Robert Stephane.</hi> In other textes not controuerted, the English text, it alone is sufficient in a Scottish or English tretise, &amp; therfore omit we the latin. Further as cōcerning my citations of ancient &amp; vnsuspect writers, I haue chosen the same out of the most old &amp; faithfull copies, cheiflie those that be found in old Popish libraries, and imprinted by Popish Printers: But as for the new coppies and latter editions, there is a malicious ordinance obserued in these latter daies, by the which, the Friers of <hi>Louane,</hi> and other Papisticall correctors, eiketh, paireth, &amp; peruerteth al good and rare bookes, causing first one sort of them to be imprinted vnder their testimoniall, so that (as that same testimoniall therein imprinted beareth) nothing is left therein that may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Romane Church, although the Authour by his true edition had neuer so much inveighed against Rome. Therafter al the remanent Popish Printers, do follow these new peruerted Coppies, in their latter editions, without any testimoniall, as being warranted by the saide first testimonial: &amp; this is most euident to be seen by their book intituled <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Expurgatorius.</hi> Praying therfore al good men to beware of these, We desire earnestly with our hearts sto to proceede hereinto, that trueth may come to light, and that such groundes may be laid, as thereby the ignorant and simple Reader may be best instructed, the godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christian most surely confirmed, and the arrogant and obstinate caluminator ratherest confounded &amp; put to silence. But forsomuch as this our good intention and godly purpose, doeth alwaies proceede of a very tender and frail veshell, and that as all liquors (how precious soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) doth take some tast of their veshells: So this holy worke may in some thinges (though not espied by my selfe) tast of my imperfections. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humblie I submit these imperfections whatsoeuer, to the gentil cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of every wise and discreete person, who in the motion of Gods spirite judgeth vprightly, without envie or partialitie. Praying all good men to haue me apardoned of whatsoeuer is a misse: for although I haue not done herein perfectly as I would, yet zealouslie as I could, knowing that the poore Widdowes mite was acceptable vnto the Lord: for euery man hath not gold, siluer, silks &amp; purple to offer to the work of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: to me (as saith <hi>Ierome</hi>) it shall be much, If I may purchase wooll, or flockes to offer to that holy work. And surely, this that I haue, howe small soeuer it be, till God enlarge me with more I offer it gladly, vnto the glory of God and aedification of his true Church. To God therfore the disposer of this, and all other godly workes and meditations, who liueth and raigneth eternally in Trinitie and Vnitie; be glory praise, laude and thanks, for euer and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
