him because I speak as it were to his face: &amp; because I speake to you (Right Reverend) which haue knowne him so long▪ and ever since you knewe him, haue loved him so deatly. But I would his modesty woulde not forget her selfe in one thing, nor make him in iudging of himselfe to attribute (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most against modesty) more to his owne iudgment, in which he is too severe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

For why shoulde hee suffer his learned papyrs to bee like the hidden riches of a covetous man, good for none vntill the ovvners death? as if it vvere not with the workes of learned men, that are published after the auctors death, as with children which are borne after their fathers death (<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>) or as if since falshood now hath gotten so strong a heade, the shamefast modesty of the learned vvere not to bee contente to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>cken her bridle, and to suffer zeale to vse the spurre. It is not shamefastnesse
<pb facs="6"/>
nor her daughter silence, of which they nowe have neede. Both of which, as they are excuses for me diocrity, so they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudices against excellency: as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wisedome of fools, so in such times as these are, they are the folly of the wise. Neither is it much more excusable, in such times of ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>de, for the learned to hide themselues with Achilles, then for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>es by boldnes, so much the other fals short by fearfulnes, both of them are much amisse. And therfore Xenophō in his third booke of Memorables, makes Socrater to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ke no lesse care to disswade Charmides, the vncle of Plato the Philosopher, from refraining himselfe, then to disswade Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, the brother to the same Plato, frō thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting himselfe forwardes, to medle in the buisines of the publike state. The former of these was a man of very much worth, but of too little boldnes: the later was a man of very much boldnes, but of too little wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>h. The fault of the later was more odious but the fault of the former was more hurtfull, more reason to blame the later: but more neede to blame the former. The later by too much contemning others, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="6"/>
himselfe, made himselfe cōtemtible: but the former by too much regarding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and contemning himselfe made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnprofitable. The later by his boldnes gained the dispraise which he might haue avoided▪ but the former by his shamefast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes avoided the commendation which he might haue ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ed▪ asmuch as the one nee ded the bridle, so much the other needed the spurre: the one for his owne sake, that he might leaue drawing on harme vppon himselfe: the other for the cōmon wealths sake: that he might leaue of with holding the publique good.
