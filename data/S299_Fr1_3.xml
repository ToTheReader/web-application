   <head>¶ Aduertisements to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit to my singular comfort (Christian Reader) I might in the Sunne-shine of mine owne happinesse haue enioyed to my selfe the great benefite of Gods fauour shewed mee in my conuersion from Romish nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the ancient Catholike Faith, taught in this Kingdome; yet for that I had diuers reasons inuiting mee to the participation thereof vnto other mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that what was priuate to my selfe, might be also a publique good vnto others; I haue thought it expedient with the promulgation of it, for thy better information concerning my selfe, to propound vnto thee some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aduertisements, whereby thou mayest the better know mee and my meaning, who am otherwise perhappes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto thee; and accordingly with moderation of iudgement, void of impatient humour or partialitie, censure my proceedings, in the matters handled in this Treatise.</p>
   <p n="2">2 First therefore, I would haue thee take notice, that some few, more zealous and earnest than charitable or wise followers of the Church of Rome, sticke not to obiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, That they cannot be perswaded, that I am truly in iudgement &amp; vnderstanding a sincere Professor of the faith of England, otherwise than for some priuate respect, eyther of liberty, or other contentment or preferment; whereby you may well inferre, that they haue no great opinion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorance in me of their Doctrine, nor of actual miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb facs="4"/>in maners that should make me forsake their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, since they thinke I haue too much knowledge to be in heart of any other, and yet can charge mee of no misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; for mine owne part, I must needes tell you, that herein they are either very ignorant in their vnderstandings, or malitiously affected in their willes; ignorant of the true knowledge of Gods fauour in conuerting sinners, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious to the Church of England, whereunto I haue incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated my selfe; and therefore to disgrace it, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without either true vnderstanding or vertue, to cast any sinister imputation they can vpon my person; which I doubt not but by Gods assistance and the endeuors of patience &amp; and diligence; I shall turne to their owne shame, and to the further manifestation of the wicked doctrines and impieties of their Romish Church; without any indignitie or disgrace to the Church to which I am now incorporated.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Secondly, I would further haue thee know, that some few Priests of their Church, hauing growne debauched in their liues and conuersations, and after their forsaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of Rome for a cloake of liberty to their lewd inclinations, haue proued most treacherous to those vnto whom before they professed friendship, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their owne consciences perswaded they did not well in discouering Priests, and causing them to be apprehended and ransacking the houses of Recusants, more for their own profits, than for any desire of seruice to the state, or zeale to the Church of England; giuing ouer all exercise both of vertue or learning, fit for Cleargy men. Hereupon diuers of the Romaine Church haue made their aduantage for the iustification of their owne Religion, and reproofe of theyr aduersaries faith; insomuch that I heard a Iesuit of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation say, that a great noble man of this realme being in conference with others of his rancke should say, that he much wondred why such men as were vertuous in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages so long as they were of the Church of Rome, when they came to the Church of England they prooued disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb facs="5"/>of life, &amp; most licentious in their conuersations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as such as went from the Church of England to the church of Rome, though they were neuer so disorderly before, they afterward were reformed in their conuersations, and most religiously exemplar in their behauiours. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to shew that this obseruation proueth not alwayes so, and that those of the English Church might not bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this illusion of the Diuell, you may from me take notice, that it hath pleased almighty God heretofore to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert diuerse who haue liued with good fame in the Church of England, and of late one master <hi>Richard Sheldon,</hi> whose both learning &amp; vertuous conuersation, euen in the Church of Rome, hath beene such as is vnimpeachable by any of his Aduersaries, as farre forth as euer I could heare, and so still manifesteth as much in religious zeale to the Church of England; and for mine owne part, I can boldly say, that I find as good curbes by the Doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to keepe men from sinne, as in the Church of Rome; by vertue whereof, I doubt not, but with Gods assistance I shall liue to serue him in this Church with lesse sinne than euer I could haue done in the Church of Rome.</p>
   <p n="4">4 Thirdly, I must giue you further notice, that it is a thing wel knowne, that there are in this realme many dissembling Protestants, which outwardly doe all the acts of Religion belonging to this Church of England, either to stay in their places in the common-wealth, or to anoyde their penall lawes; and yet in their hearts are resolued beleeuers of the Roman Faith, egregiously dissembling both with God and men, and practising most notorious equiuocation, aswell in matters of faith as manners; who will not sticke to take oathes, receiue Sacraments, go to Church, and commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a like act directly against their consciences &amp; perswasion, which according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is sinne;<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>14.</hi> vers. <hi>23</hi>
      </note> nay, I dare affirme that it is a hainous mortall sinne, approaching neare to that sinne against which Christ himselfe pronounceth a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous threatning ful of terror to any considerat heart, saying;
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>That he that sinneth against the holy Ghost, shall neuer be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luc. <hi>12.</hi> vers. <hi>10.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> Whence it may appeare, that such men, as they are most treacherous to God, so may it be probably thought they cannot be loyall vnto men; and therefore are they to bee held the most dangerous men that can be in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, preferring the glorie of men before the glorie of God: which being a thing much practised by some affected to the Church of Rome, I haue beene the more willing, both for their better information, to publish these my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, as also to giue satisfaction to the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land concerning my selfe, who am (I thanke God) most free from so hatefull a crime, odious both to God and man.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Fourthly, I am further to let you vnderstand, that my intention in these my Obseruations, being more for the instruction of the Professors of the Church of Rome, than for those of the Church of England (who stand in no neede of so meane a scholler as my selfe) I haue cited often the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Church euen against themselues, thinking no way better to confute their Doctrines, than by their owne grounds and their owne Teachers. And although I handle not all points controuersed betwixt Rome and the reformed Churches at this day; yet doe I so entreat of the chiefest points of Practise and Doctrine, that all those being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be but erronious and nouell, and such as cannot stand with the true grounds of Christianitie, I thinke there is no man of sound iudgement can thinke I had iust cause to stay any longer in that Church, or that themselues can be partakers of Saluation, remaining in the same.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Fifthly, my further desire is, that thou who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safest to be the Reader of these my vnpolished lines, wilt with as fauourable a minde entertaine them for thy profit, as I, out of charitable affection to Gods seruants, doe most freely publish them to the world; desiring Almightie God to giue thee grace to reade them with due attention, and to ruminate vpon them with mature deliberation, laying aside
<pb facs="6"/>all partialitie in thy censures, or inordinate desire of any cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nouelties; my resolution in the writing of them being more for the profit and spirituall good of others, than for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purchase, either of praise or estimation to my selfe; desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the naked truth, set forth without any colours of art or elocution, may shew it owne power and force to preuaile against falshood. And so wishing you all happinesse, both temporall and eternall, I leaue thee to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on of Almightie God:</p>

      <signed>Yours zealously affected in Christ Iesus. <hi>I. C.</hi>
