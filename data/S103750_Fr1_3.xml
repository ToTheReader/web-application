And fyrste vnderstande thys that the holy scripture is not knowen by our owne exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the prophecy was not gyuen in one tyme by the wyll of man.<note place="margin">ii. Peter .i.</note> But the holy men of God, inspired of the holy gooste haue spoken it.

      </gap>rly instructed to al good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, by the which so many euident textes vnto vs is apparently shewed that the rule of oure fayth is the onely and holy word of God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whiche onely we ought al to beleue and keepe in all that concerneth God and oure sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Whereunto by greate fidelitie exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs the holy Apostle of Iesu Christe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thys maner.<note place="margin">Phillip. iii.</note> Procede we in one self rule whereunto we be comen, bycause that we may be all one. Nowe it is certeyne that in folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the opinions and fantasies of men (the which are so variable, and contrary eche vnto other) that neuer we may be of one accorde but it is behouefull for vs to take one soole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our lyght and bryghtnes, for oure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and leadynge. The whyche alone to be oure perfite and entier rule whych can not nor

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them sayth he, and not ouer the other, for there is but one only waye of saluacion.</p>
   <p>It is than right euident that the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the onely stone and foundation of oure sayth by such wise that we ought not for to be leue,<note place="margin">Math.</note> nor hold any thing whatsoeuer it be, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diuine thinges, but as it is cōteined in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy scripture, without chaūging any thing, adding or minishing, Otherwise it shoulde bee no more fayth, but folish opinion, imaginacion dreme error, desceit, &amp; knaueri. Therfor it is not behoueful for any creature to vndertake for to adde, inuent, chaunge, or diminish whatsoeuer thing of the sayd holi &amp; immaculate worde, but in al and ouer all it ought to be taken &amp; lefte in the right purety and clere simplicite wythout pluckinge (as thy fantasi is) to other sens thā the holy spirite, hath reueiled it, and that vpon payne of eternall malediction, yea &amp; if it were an angel of heauen.

And if any that by some space of tyme haue liued, haue preched, writē diffined beleued
<pb facs="3"/>and taught otherwise thā the said holy worde bereth or conteyneth, it is nothing worthy of allegacion, for be the tyme neuer so longe, it is nothinge estemed or reputed in the presence of God as it is writen.<note place="margin">Psal. xi.ii. Pet. iii.</note> A. M. yeres in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> presence of God is as a daye passed that is to say as no thing, or a veri smal thinge. ¶ Moreouer God hath ordeyned tyme behouefull at hys owne good pleasure,<note place="margin">Roma. i.</note> wherin he hath determined reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led, and manifested his verite. The which time can nether be forthered nor hyndred. For y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose of God is vnmouable, whyche he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly shewed and declared in the temporal and holy natiuite of his sonne, the which came not incontinent after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> transgression of Adam but taried longe tyme, and by the space of thre.

Thys notwithstanding whan the plenitude of tyme ordeined of God was occōplished, than he sent his sonne made of a woman, made vnder the law, to thend that he should agayne,<note place="margin">Gala. iiii.</note> bye them that were vnder the lawe.</p>
   <p>Nowe after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he hath done to vs this great mercy, shoulde it not be a greate pride and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnkindnes in stead to giue him graces and thankes for such a benigne and charytable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (for the which he gaue his onely sonne) to say, wherefore taried he so long? why came he no soner? I haue spoken this for to touche and abate the ingratitude and arrogaunce of many poore blynde persones the which at this present tyme (to whom it hath pleased God by his infinite bounty, many festing him selfe by his holy worde and gospell of saluacion, the whych a certayn of tyme by the permission of tyme was dispised, contemned. caste vnder fote
<pb facs="4"/>corrupt &amp; put in forgetfulnes) sai these wordes of plasphemy, or other like, and wherfore hath he taried so longe wherfore shewed he thys no soner? Haue not our predecessors lyued well? It suffiseth vs to lyue as they ded, so many great clerkes &amp; wise folkes folowing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes and determinacions of the vniuersities, the Cerimonies and ordynaunces of the Pope may they fayle? which be wordes of ignoraūt folkes, or mockers, hard hertedand obstynate. By y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which wordes their ignoraūce so clerely doeth shew, that it is noyesome, as touchinge the misteries of God.</p>
   <p>They vnderstand nothing but by infidelite, beinge put in reproued sences w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out teare or re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerence, preferring horible blasphemes, whiche is a signe of the yre and furor of God, decla, ryng vpon suche folkes ineuitable ruyne, and most dredfull damnacyon.

In the which without any doubt, al they shall beleue that be ordeyned to the life eternal, and none other &amp; all to the honor glory and prayse of god To the which thynge as true, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient childrē to him we ought to procur, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out sparing anye thinge, or in aniwise to dissimule</p>
   <p>This is for an aduertisment that in this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sēt mater it behoueth eche one to stay wholy to the holy word of god, as to that wherby al cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures shalbe iudged. All thing ought to be exa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mined and proued, and none maye contrary it Now for to touch y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> purpose wherof presētly we treate. It is nedefull by holy scriptures to declare and euidently to shewe: how the masse ordeined of the Pope and Bishops, and other parsones whiche in greate pride againste right and reason named them selfe of the church, is directly against verite, &amp; manifestly against the holy worde of God. And therfore it is an abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minoble thyng that ought not to be permitted to endure, by cause y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> by the same the Lord god is greatly offended, And the most parte of the world vnhappily seduced and begiled, The whiche masse vnder shadow &amp; colour of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the more easily to seduse and deceyue the world, hath ben brought, and thus cautelously
<pb facs="5"/>compassed not by holy scripture. Wherin can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not onely be founde the name of masse. But by sondri Popes and Bishops with other lyke it hath ben founde, and put in the stead of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly supper of Iesus Christ, of the holy table of the precious &amp; holy bread of thākesgeuinge the which ought to be taken of the cōgregation of al faythful Christē people, in minde &amp; recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the death and passion of Iesus Christ, in remembraūce also of the charite &amp; dilection wherwith he loued vs so muche that he gaue his lyfe for vs Lykewise in significatiō of the charite and loue fraternall, wherby we ought to loue eche other, as members of the bodye of Iesus Christe.</p>
   <p>In the stead of the whyche so salutary and, cōsolable instituciō, in pōpious Ceremony for theyr pleasure they haue caused vs for to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a lytell bread, as if it were the very God, wherin all idolatry, al iniquite, and wickednes is reised. And this haue they done, the better to authorise theyr reygne and lordeshipe, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to exercise theyr tiranny, the more easily to make marchādises of our soules, &amp; deuour the substaunce of the people, &amp; finally to cause thē selfes to be worshipped. For as people effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without shame hauing harlots foreheades, they durst well say, &amp; publy shed that they were more worthy than angels or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> virgin Marye. Because that if one of thē (albeit that he is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect, &amp; a harlot full of filthines) helde a morcell of breade in his hande he hath the power (if he wil) furth w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wythout declaration at his onely worde there to cause the sonne of god to come and descende in body and in soule all a lyue, as byg and as hole as he hanged on the crosse
<pb facs="5"/>to beare him here &amp; there, to kepe him in a boxe or an almery, to eate hym &amp; swalow him whan he list. To be short, and let him do what he wil, it is an horrible thinge to thinke on it. And if they be demaūded from whēs they haue &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to thē this merueilous power more thā the other that be not disguised, anointed, shorne or cliped. They answere better thā they wene. For they say it is bycause of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> caracter, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is to say, the tokē &amp; meruelous marke wher w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> they be sygned, but if they thoughte well on that, that they do say, truly shame and feare would styll them. For it is wrytten that none maye cheapen, sell nor bye but he haue the marke of the beaste.<note place="margin">Apoc. viii.</note>
   </p>
   <p>How be it because that our mater may be wel builded, clerely vnderstād &amp; proued. It is nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to touche, declare and shewe in perticuler some pointes of abhominacion that be fosid in this masse. For to shew all it is almost impossy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, and I beleue that no mā can do it, &amp; if any hade power gyuen for to do it, it behoueth hym to haue a very great boke, so much maledictiō is enclosed therin, &amp; detestable perdition. Not withstāding y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> to many it semeth precious and fayre But as it is writen in S. Luke. That which is high vnto mē,<note place="margin">Luce. xvi</note> is abhomination afore God. And S. Paul dare wel sai y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> the angel of sathā trans figureth him selfe in to an angel of lighte,<note place="margin">ii. Cor. xi.</note> The whiche in this place is veri greatly fulfylled, whan vnder the shaddowe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, vnder apparaunce of veritie, somuche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge and falsenes in hypocrisie is founde and whiche is worst of all, this euyll is so greatlye shed, this canker is so much sowen through all the body of christēdom. Thys miserable herbe
<pb facs="6"/>hath spred the rotes so farre, that vnto man it is impossible to remedy it, but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which is impo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ssible to mā, is easy to the Lord God. Therfore retourne we to hym, and wyth a meke herte pray we him that it wil please him to be hold vs in his mercy,<note place="margin">Luke. xviii</note> giue vs his blessing, and open oure eyes in suche wise that we maye clearely knowe the veryte, Amen.</p>
