                 <title>A Christian reprofe against contention : Wherin is declared and manifested a just defence of the Church against such slanderes and reproches which Sabine Staresmore hath layd vpon vs in his two bookes, the first being 16 questions, called a louing tender. The second is hi preface and postscript befor and behind Mr. Answorths last sermon, and making a pretence by that to sett it out as a loue token, hee breetheth out his malice against vs: and lastly her is an answer to a letter written by Mr. Robinson, and sent to vs with the consent of his Church, which now Mr. Staresmore hath published to the world. To these things an answer is giuen by A.T</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I giue thee to vnderstand: Wee haue not been forward to publish to the world these our co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>trouersies, and this thou maist take knowledge of, because the first of these our opposites books, hath been in print so many yeares, being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare 1623▪ being 16. Questions of their owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in the which wee haue great wronge done vnto vs; yet haue wee patiently borne both that, and also that which they have printed the last yeare against vs, vntell such time wee heard by many witnesses, that our long silence hath turned to the hinderance of the trueth, and also our owne discredit: for diners haue been perswaded through our long silence, that wee are most in fault, or else wee would haue answered before this time▪ therfore for the trueth sake, &amp; our owne defence, we though it need full to sett o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> this <hi>Christian Reprofe</hi> vnto these our opposites, in the which thou maist see the great injury, they doe vnto the trueth and also vnto vs, by their vnjust imputations and slanderes, which they haue layd vpon vs: and althought for our selues wee could haue born these injuries in silence: yet for the trueth sake, and that none that haue a loue vnto the trueth, should be hindered or stomble thereat, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needfull it is that they should bee informed of the trueth of things as they are, in these our troubles, which by this short Answer, thou mayst take knowledge of. And although it consisteth of cōtrouersy, which it not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as some more heauenly meditations are: yet not withstanding the Lord doth suffer such things to arise, for the approuing of such as are faithfull: 1. Cor. 11. 18. 19 &amp; that the people of God should not ly vpon the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>d of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: Songes the 5. 5. but keepe their Christian watch, knowing that Satan seeketh too surprise vs by many meanes &amp; wayes▪ 1. Peter 5. 8. Act. 20. 31. for when he can not retaine vs, in the broad wayes of the world; then will he send out the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>oods of his persecutions, to see if hee can swallow vs vp in it, Reu. 12. 15. but when hee is restrained frō his purpose by the Lord, then will hee seek to ouerthrow vs by his ministers whom hee seduceth, euen in the Church of God, &amp; so turne thē into shape, as if they were the ministers of righteousnesse, 2. Cor. 15. Act. 20. 29. 30. And of these things, gentle Reader, haue wee had our portion, diuers of vs hauing been persecuted by inprisonment, and many till death did insue, &amp; others banneshed, &amp; some loosing their right &amp; inheiritāce, and must leaue it and be exsiled: yet these troubles are not so dangerous, nor yet so greuious vnto a sincere conscience, as seducers which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>se in the true Church: and many that haue gone through persecutions, yet haue been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by seducers, &amp; drawne away frō the true way of God; yet this is no new
<pb facs="2"/>
thing as thou mayst see by those Scripturs before alledged: and as it was with the Churches of God of old, so is it at this present time with vs, for wee hauing gone through many persecutions, so haue wee had our part of trialls by declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; seducers: and these our opposites hath greatly troubled vs with their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, some they hath corrupted their with, &amp; others they haue so incumbered their mindes, that they dayly trouble vs with Contention: and to bring their porposes about, they came most Lords dayes, diuers years &amp; troubled vs with great desturbance, many haue been the prouocations, which they haue vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs to prouoke vs: so that wee may truely say, that as Paule had fought with beast at Ephesus, so haue wee at Amsterdam, fought with men of a beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conditiō, 1. Cor. 15. 32. &amp; although I could say mor in these things, yet for the present I spare, to see if the Lord will worke vpō their hearts by this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reprofe, which if it take not effect, but that they goe on to striue against the trueth, the Lord can giue a fit opportunity that their deedes may be fully layd open, cōcerning these things in question. And now Christian Reader, take thou heed, that thou stomble not at these things to forsake the trueth, for these things ought not to bee strange vnto thee, seeing the Apostells of Christ hath fortolde of these things, Act. 20. 29. 30. 2. Pet. 2. 1. 2. 3. yea &amp; themselues were troubled with such trialles, whilles they were with the Churches, Actes 15. 2. Gal. 2. 4. 5. and som preaching Christ through enuie &amp; strife, supposing to adde more affliction too the Apostells bandes, Phil. 1. 16. And hath not the Apostell told vs, that in these last dayes shall come perillous times, and that all sortes of sinnes shall abound? 2. Tim. 3. 1. 2. 3. which should teach vs to bee more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to judge wisly of things, and not too bee offended at the trueth, or any part thereof; for it is the trueth that maketh vs free, Iohn 8. 31. 32. &amp; yet when the Lord of glory was vpon the earth, which taught the trueth more excellent then euer did any, yet his owne Disciples went backe, &amp; walked no more with him, stombling at his heauenly doctrine: seeing it is thus, that our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so soone caried a syde: how should wee desier of God, to haue the spirit of discerning, &amp; of sincerity to walke in the trueth; &amp; wheras wee haue been euill spoken of, too be cōtentious, and of fierry spirits, with many such like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches: But what is the cause that wee are thus reproched? is it not because wee withstand errour and sinne: and suerly, although wee are weake men, yet hearin wee follow the examples of the Prophetes of God. Was not Moyses the meekest man vpon the earth▪ yet was hee stored vp many times to great anger, because of the sinnes of the people: and who is more redy to carpe at the zeale of Gods people, then louse persons, or lucke warme Christians, which are redy to say as Ahab, 2. Cron. 18. 7. that when the word of God is spoken for their reprofe, they thinke it is neuer well spoken to them, well for mens esteem wee passe not vpon it: but I turn my speech to such as are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: if they haue the loue of the trueth, and if they haue a desier too keepe the Lords watch in his house, then I say to such as Iehu sayd too Iehonadab 2. Kings 10. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>f their hartes bee vpright to the Lord, &amp; to vs as ours is vnto them, then let them no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> stagger at these troubles: But come and helpe vs in our heauenly iourney: for great are the hinderances by our corrupt flesh and this world, and Satan hee vseth both these to insnare vs.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>But for such as are corrupt, and vnder a pretence of peace, and lowlines of minde, Col. 2. 18. will either broch errour or plead for sinne; vnto such I say with Dauid, Psalm 119. 115. which saith: Depart from mee yee eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ll doers, for I will keep the commandements of my God. And this I speake not of singularity, but because I find that our corrupt nature hath not need of helpers into sinne: for wee are subject of our selues to run into sinne dayly. And now Christian Reader, for as much as the diuell hath in these our dayes reuiued a new his ancient course, teaching of men to abuse the Name of God, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap>, I refer thee to the 16. 17. 18. pages of this booke: And now that which I haue written, I commit it to thy judgment, in the which I pray thee bee not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, but read with consideration, and then with Moyses to say to him that doeth the wrong: Why smi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
