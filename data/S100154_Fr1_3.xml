      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nderstand Christian Reader, that with the comming forth of this booke into the light, the learned and famous Authour D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ames left the light, or darknes rather of this world. His name for diverse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (not needfull here to be recited) hath been hitherto concealed, and that which generally was but imagined before, (viz. that the Repl. and this fresh suit to D. B. Rejoynder) to be his work, now it is certainly known to be his, that none need to doubt therof. It pleadeth trueth succinctly, yet perspicuously, and with sinewy Answeres to B.M. and D. B. poore Sophisms, as indeed his veinc in all his writings and discourses did most admirably lead him to do. Concerning this matter, I may not keep back what I heard him speake as in the sight of God, that he was in his conscience more perswaded of the evill of these reliques of Popery and monuments of that superstition then ever, and yet he never had seen good in them, or come from them: and that moreover if

D. B. or any other of them would yet be daubing with suntempered mortar, and not give over to paint rotten sepulchres, he was by the grace of God resolved still to maintain the cause, and while he liued never let fall the uit commenced this way, not that he sought victorie to himselfe, no; That trueth might returne out of the feild with conquest was the highest pitch of his ambition. And though this worthy of the Lord be with us no more, yetGod (I trust) who is rich in mercy, and hath more then one blessing, will (as need shall require) supply the advantage trueth had, and now hath lost in the losse of this glorious instrument. Together with his life God hath put an end to all his travailes, wherein he shewed himself a pattern of holines, a burning and a shining light, and lamp of learning &amp; Arts, a Champion for trueth, specially while for the space of <hi>12</hi> yeares at least, he was in the Doctors Chaire at Franequer, and having fough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the good fight of faith, whereunto he was called, &amp; professed a good profession before nyamwitnesses, he hath now indeed layd hold on eternall life. His spirit gon to the spirits of just men, and his body committed to the ground, we committ his labours to thy use, wherein he being dead, yet speaketh, and his memorie we hope shall live for ever.</p>
