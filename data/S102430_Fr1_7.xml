   <lg>
      <l>COnsider (<hi>Sacred Nyne</hi>) the cause why I doe weepe,</l>
      <l>And in this time of publicke Griefe, a doleful cōsort keepe.</l>
      <l>Stricke sad vpon your <hi>Lyrs,</hi> Threnodicallie sing,</l>
      <l>And let the torrent of your teares match your <hi>Castal'an Spring.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Send out your sighs with myne, as Heralds of our woe.</l>
      <l>To tell the world, wee are injur'd, by man-kynds ruethles Foe,</l>
      <l>Whose hand, alace; hath spoyld our Countreys rarest gemme,</l>
      <l>And slayne <hi>Minerva's</hi> Minion, sprung from a statelie stemme.</l>
      <l>Who can abstaine from Teares, to see his Shryne enterr'd,</l>
      <l>On whom the <hi>Lord,</hi> with lib'rall hand, so many Gifts cōferr'd▪</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="8"/>And these in mercie were so seasoned with Grace,</l>
      <l>That every eye saw him a man proportion'd for his place.</l>
      <l>And which adorn'd him much, and did inlarge his fame,</l>
      <l>Hee clearly taught the wayes of <hi>God,</hi> and walked in the same,</l>
      <l>His thoughts converst with <hi>God,</hi> his lips were Trueth her keys,</l>
      <l>Authoritie and Courtesie were pincell'd in his eyes.</l>
      <l>And what I ever thought, my pen shall now proclaime,</l>
      <l>Hee was the splendor of our Church, and glorie of his Name.</l>
      <l>Our soveraign Lord, our Church, our Schools, &amp; publick Stat,</l>
      <l>Doe all concurre (through sense of losse) for to condoll this fate.</l>
      <l>For while hee liv'd, his gifts were vsefull for them all:</l>
      <l>But GOD for to afflict the earth, by death did him recall.</l>
      <l>Leaving his darling Church, the Orphane of his care,</l>
      <l>The world the relict of his worth, this Sea an emptie Chaire.</l>
      <l>Yet everie place retaynes▪ Characters, of his worth,</l>
      <l>VVhich ravisht myndes did oft admire, but no hand could set foorth.</l>
      <l>Then, <hi>Muse,</hi> bee not asham'd, sincerelie to confesse,</l>
      <l>That thou will but obscure his worth if thou preasse to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.</l>
      <l>This pearlesse Prelats praise, in whō we saw cōbynd</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Minervas</hi> wit, <hi>Apollo's tongue,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> zealous mynde.</l>
      <l>An vnrelenting hope, firme fayth, and daring cowrage;</l>
      <l>A Soule devote, a lyfe vnstayn'd, a kyndlie-manlie visage.</l>
      <l>A will propense to good, a just-divyded eare;</l>
      <l>A marble breast, well fortified against th'assaults of Feare:</l>
      <l>A heart enricht with loue, a mynde with deepe conceptions;</l>
      <l>A tongue and pen replenished with ravishing expressions.</l>
      <l>His wit vntyed all knots, his cowrage overcame</l>
      <l>All incident difficulties. Hee ever was the same.</l>
      <l>But since my slow-plum'd <hi>Muse,</hi> with her vnsassel'd phraises,</l>
      <l>Can not amount the high extent of his deserved praises,</l>
      <l>I will resigne this taske to some <hi>Maron'an</hi> pen,</l>
      <l>Which can more fitlie celebrate this <hi>Quintessence of Men.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="8"/>Yet no <hi>Virgil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>an</hi> quill, can honour him so much,</l>
      <l>As hee will dignifie the same; his worthienesse was such.</l>
      <l>Wherein I dare avow hee hath exceeded all</l>
      <l>That ever did possesse this Chaire, I feare, or ever shall.</l>
      <l>But if that <hi>Sions</hi> Lord, who treads vpon the Sphears,</l>
      <l>Shal blesse this Church with such a Guide? then i'll recant my Fears.</l>
      <l>And with a heart enlarg'd, praise HIM while I haue breath.</l>
      <l>Who only can fil vp the breach, made by our Prelats death.</l>
