   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas there are two bookes written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the setting of Corne: the first commending it, the second disgracing it; both of them discoursing so Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerlike, that the plaine Countrie Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man, cannot iudge which of them hath most skill for instruction in this kinde of Husbandrie; and perceiuing that the second treatise (called <hi>God speede the Plough</hi>) hath disswaded great numbers from the practise of setting of Corne: I was aduised and resolued to aduenture the publike censuring of this Instruction. Wherein I desire to proue how much more casie and profitable, Plowing and Setting will be in all places, and that with lesse charge, then either Plowing and Sowing, or digging and Setting, desiring to be freed from all suspition, to contend for art or learning with any of the former writers. And like a plaine Ploughman to shew my opinion, what I thinke of the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, betweene the Plowe and the spade: in a word, I iudge both these profitable instruments may right well be vsed in their proper places, that the Plowe may keepe his place in the fields,<note place="margin">A little good counsel would haue saued all your labour in writing, and mine in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering: but I: hope it will doe good.</note> to the great increase of Corne, and the Spade in the Gardens for rootes, hearbs, and flowers, necessarie for household prouision. And I could haue wished you the Gentleman and author of the booke (called <hi>God speede the Plowe</hi>) had taken better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of some skilfull Husbandman, before you had published a
<pb facs="4"/>booke, wherein you indeuour to correct and teach an Arte, which you acknowledge is none of your profession, &amp; to haue considered how easelie for the most part our English Nation are disswaded from good causes, neither for the glorie of God, or the honour and profit of their Prince and Countrie: for though it be true, that very fewe innouations in the Church, or nouelties in a state, are not alwaies and generallie good, and profitable for all places, and for all people: yet these profitable inuentions, speciallie in Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, should rather be commended then disgraced, vntill a manifest error in them be discouered, and that by experience and proofe. Againe, you ought rather to haue remembred and well considered the lamentable case of the poore that liued in distresse in the late yeeres of dearth, who notwithstanding the charitable orders taken by her Maiestie, her honorable Counsell and other officers of the kingdome, to the glorie of God, and their high commendation: yet was it well seene with the eyes of the trulie charitable, that except the King of heauen and earth had relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the poore people of this Land, with Corne out of his storehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in other Countries; the poore and the rich also had been in hazard to haue perished by famine, that might haue fallen vpon this sinfull people, or by some wofull calamities, inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of penurie and want. And let euery indifferent man consider what huge quantities of Corne may yeerely be saued, that now is cast away by Plowing and Sowing: yet giue me leaue plainelie to giue you a proiect what this would come vnto. Some writers of our time account but nine thousand sixe hundred and two and fiftie Parishes, or thereabouts, in England, and suppose sixe hundred and two and fiftie of them to be in Cities and Townes vsing no Tyllage: and so account but nine thousand Countrie Parishes, and because the author of the booke (called <hi>God speede the Plough</hi>) writeth, that if a Parish haue three thousand Acres of erable land, which is about thirtie or fortie Ploughlands in a Parish, therefore mistrusting his iudgement,
<pb facs="4"/>we will admit but ten Plowelands, one Parish with another; so nine thousand Parishes hath foure score and ten thousand Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and that if in euery Ploweland there may easely be saued yeerely ten or twelue quarters of Seede Corne, that now is cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which shall be directly proued, it will amount to some nine or ten hundred thousand quarters of Graine that might euery yeere be saued in her Maiesties dominions: I dare affirme so much (be it more or lesse) as would fetch hither the Indies Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure out of Spaine and other Countries farre distant; to the great honour and riches of our Prince and Countrie, and especiallie the maintenance of our English Nauie, with plentifull prouision also of victuals for Souldiers both by Sea and Land, to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort, and the terror of all forraine enemies.</p>
   <p>And to conclude, I wish that they whose hearts the Lord hath endewed with true wisedome, and charitie, to remember and consider well of this danger, from which the Lord hath so lately deliuered vs: and let vs all serue that God in the moderate vse of his creatures, and not consume in riotous gluttonie and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, such great quantities of his blessings, to the hurt of our bodies and soules, the poore being readie to famish before our eyes. So I commend thee good Christian Reader, to Gods protection, and this worke to the blessing of the Almightie.</p>
   <p>The particular proofes of this good Husbandrie, shall be seene in a dialogue, betweene a Ploughman and a Scholler, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instruction of plaine Countrie people.</p>
