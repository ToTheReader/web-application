Gratie, he can not moste

and cheerefull promptnesse of
courage, studie to gratifie you,
studie to make you beare with
one, that fayne woulde, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

dames, is Bountifull benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
a ladie of louely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and noble stomake, one
that alwaies longeth, still ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge

euermore beholdyng the firste,
with amiable countenāce, with
faithfull eie of remembraunce,
and full intente of recompence,
as farre, as power furthered
with moste desire maie or can.
Under suche cloudes, sage and

with muche more delectacion

beyng playnly spoken. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as you nowe se, what they

you muste also nedes see, howe

   <p>For howe can I, my lord your

I, beeyng enuyronned with so

not desire Thalia and Euphro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sine
that thei both report me, to
lacke power, but no good wil,
I truste they bothe shall haue
good cause so to do. Certes, if
I had sene, where either my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel

better haue serued his lordship
than in openyng vnto you his

   <p>This boke, was gathered by
Ludouicus Uines, a man great
lie conuersaunt in all good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and excellentlie wel sene
in all kindes of learnyng. The
boke hath vndoubtedly, muche
more liyng in his bosome, than
the title promiseth in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed.
It is not onely an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to wisedome, but if ye
goe as it leadeth you, it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
wisedom into you, roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
the loue and desire of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in your hert, extirpyng frō
it all maner of vice, and all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clennesse,
furnishyng you with
<pb facs="6"/>
generall preceptes, for all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of life, for all ages, for all
degrees and condicions, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
preceptes, if you harbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
in your breaste, must nedes be a
great slaie, helpe, and comfort
vnto your tender age. They
shal bryng to passe many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in your life time, with gret
pleasure, and no peyne at all,
which otherwise experience oft
tymes poudred with bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
shuld scace at length
teache you. It is as wise So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
saieth, Preceptes of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
were inuented at the first
as a nedefull staie and succour
vnto mans mynde, wantynge
knowlage &amp; experience: euen as
a staffe is geuen of necessitie, to
staie vp a feeble body, assured<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="6"/>
I knowe no one booke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translated,
that hath halfe so
many holsome documentes, as
this hath, none that mai so wel
leade you the right way to true
honour, none where ye maie
either with more delite, or more
hope of your game, trace true
nobilitie. Folowe your leader,
goe on with your guide, you
shall finde all the steppes and
grices, whereby not onely my
Lord your father, honourablie
hath climed to nobilitie, but all
other, that in dede are or were
at any time noble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> you shal find

finally, manie that are
a souereigne medicine almoste
for all diseases. The booke is
nowe yours, I truste as the ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles,
whiche it offereth vnto
you, bee great, rare, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse,
that so ye wyll see theim
laied vp in place mete for suche

maie lette theim out, and carie
them home againe, at suche ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
as ye shall thinke conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
If ye make these precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
yours, by vse of them, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
as they teache you, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
as they aduise you, who
<pb facs="7"/>
shall haue more cause to reioice
of it, thā you your self? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
can you more please my lorde
your fathers minde? What
thynge can more satisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?
What greatter comforte
can come to his Lordship, than
to see you most like him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions?
What greatter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to you, than to treade in
his steppes? What higher ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to al them that loue both?
your countrey knoweth what
noble feates my lorde your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath wrought by wisdom,
ladie gouernour of all vertues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
who knoweth not, howe hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
maie reioice, howe trueth
and religiō may holde vp their
handes to heuen, that god hath
sent to so gracious, so prudent
<pb facs="8"/>
and wise a prince, so good so
wise and so faithefull a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailour?
to so noble a maister,
so diligente a mynister, to so
high couragious and vertuous
a kyng, a subiecte of so noble
an herte and stomacke? I must
leaue of, I am entered into to
longe a matter for a shorte epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
Wherfore I can no more,
but with all herte, desire god,
that it maie please hym long to
preserue noble Henry the .viii.
styll in all welthe, in all honour
to reigne ouer vs, to the setting
foorthe of goddes honour, to
the spreadynge abrode of his

his name in all places, longe to

of the same. Finally, that

as well as of his honour
and wordelie digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
