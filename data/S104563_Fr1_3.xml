      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Henry the sixt king of that name in England, was by the Earle of Warwicke, and others, thought vnmeete to gouerne the kingdome: and Edward the fourth claimed the Crowne, in a battell neare to Saint Albans: Henry the sixt was taken prisoner in the <hi>39</hi> yeare of his reigne, Anno Dom. <hi>1461.</hi> All king Henries forces were slaine, or put to flight, amongst whom was slain on king Henries part, one Sir Iohn Gray, husband of this Lady Elizabeth Gray, of whose troubles this historie now discourseth. This Lady was after maried to king Edward the fourth: she was daughter to the Lady Iaquet, daughter to Peter Earle of Saint Paul, neece to the Lord Lewis of Leutzenbrugh, which Lady Iaquet was first married to Iohn Duke of Bedford and Regent of France; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward she was married to Sir Richard Woodvile Lord Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, by whom she had this Lady Elizabeth and others. When king Edward was setled in his kingdome, and had imprisoned Henry the sixt in the Tower of London: the Earle of Warwicke was sent into France, to intreate a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betweene King Edward the fourth and the Lady Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, daughter to Lewis Duke of Sauoy, and sister to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Carlot then wife to the French King, in whose Court this Lady Bona then was: which motion was well liked of by the French King, and all things sorted to the Earle of Warwicks desire. But in the meane time, while these things were working in France, King Edward going to his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Grafton, in the countie of Northampton; in the time
<pb facs="4"/>
of the Kings remaining there, this Lady Gray was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble suter to the King, that she might haue her Ioynter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her; which because her husband was slaine on King Henries part, was since his death detained from her. King Edward liked her so well, that after many amorous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses she was married to him at Grafton, where first he fancied her. The Kings mother and many of the Nobilitie did dislike of this mariage, because she was a widow, and his subiect. This King was married to this Lady Gray, before the Earle of Warwicke was returned from France, which some say, who will talke much and know little, was the cause of the warres afterwards betweene the King and the Earle. But the Earles hatred against the King was for another cause, as in the Chronicles you may reade. What troubles and griefe happened to this Queene in the time of her husband the Kings life, and after his death, you may imagine. You see her newly risen out of her graue, and in the extremity of her griefe speaking as followeth.</p>
