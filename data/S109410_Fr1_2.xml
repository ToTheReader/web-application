      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight woorthie and Noble Earle, whereas I before this time haue writtē sundry sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Treatises, whereof two of thē are extant in print, thone called the Regiment of the Sea, and the other the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for Trauellers, and now also this barbarous and rude thing, called the Art of shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in great Ordnaunce, and as it is most cōmonly seen, that euery person doth most cōmonly cōmend that thing wherein he is most expert, and therefore some there are that doe most extoll Diuinitie, and great reason it is that it should be so, for that it teacheth vs both to know God and to instruct others: also othersome doe most preferre Philosophie: othersome the Lawe, with such like as they are most delighted in. Also other there are, that doe not onely extoll them, but wil make arguments, and dispute whether of them are most commendable and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be preferred aboue the other. There are also, that after long disputation, doe not onely assigne euery Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his seuerall laude and praise, but also discourse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are most necessarie for a common wealth. And I am of that opinion, and that no man can denie,
<pb facs="3"/>
but that the Arte of shooting in great Ordnaunce is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be aduaunced for the defence and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a Kingdome, and countrey, and the common wealth thereof. Wherefore (Right honorable) being as one extraordinarily bolde, I present the same vnto you, for that I knowe your Lordshippe can truely descerne and iudge in these causes, as one whose wisedome is not vnknowne, hoping that your Honour will take this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worke, as my good will, rather than the valour of the thing, or the finenesse of the penning of the matter. And thus I cease to trouble your Honorable Lordship any longer at this time, desiring you to accepte this simple Booke at the handes of a poore Gunner, as a true token of my good will towardes your Honour: desiring God to prosper your Honor in all your doings in perfect health.</p>
