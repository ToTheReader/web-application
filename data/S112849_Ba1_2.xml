   <p>AFter these fautes of the prenter escaped in this boke, I shall not let good reders to geue you lyke warnynge of one faute of myne own, escaped me in my boke laste put forth of the debellacyon of Salem and Bt zance. In the. xiii. lefe wherof, and in the fyrste syde, cancell and put oute one of those ouersyghtes that I laye to the pacyfyer, in those. ix. lynes, of whyche the fyrste is the. ix. lyne of the same syde, and the laste is the. xviii.</p>
   <p>For of trouth not y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pacifyer but my selfe was ouersene in that place with a lytle haste, in mysse remembrynge one worde of his. For where as he sayth in the person of Byzance, in the thyrde lefe of Salem and byzance.</p>

         </gap> come</hi> / &amp; toke it as though he sayd as yt cometh to myne handes.</p>
   <p>And therfore albe yt that I haue knowen many that haue rede yt, of whyche I neuer founde ony y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> found yt: yet syth yt happed me lately to loke theron &amp; fynde myne ouersyght my selfe. I wolde in no wyse leue yt good reader vnreformed. Nor neuer purpose whyle I lyue, where so euer I maye perceyue, eyther myne aduer sarye to saye well, or my selfe to haue sayde otherwyse, to let for vs both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyfferently to declare and say the trewth.</p>
   <p>And surely yf they wold vse the self same honest playne trewth towarde me: you sholde sone se good readers all our contencyons ended. For than shold you se, that lyke as I haue not letted after myne apology, to declare that Tyndale had somewhat amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and aswaged in one poynte, hys formare euyl assertions concernyng
<pb facs="305"/>
satysfactyon: so shold he confesse the trouth that I had trewly touched hym / and that hym selfe had sore er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well in the remanaunt therof as in all his other heresyes. And thā also, lyke as I let not here for the pa cyfyers parte to declare my self ouer sene wyth haste in this one poynt: so shold he not let wel &amp; honestly to say y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trouth on the tother syde, &amp; confesse hym selfe very farre ouersene with longe leysoure, in all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> remanaūt by syde. I saye not in all that he sayth, but in al that is debated betwene vs.</p>
   <p>I wote well the beste horse were he which were so sure of fote that ronne he neuer so faste wolde neuer in hys lyfe neyther fall nor stūble. But syth we can fynd none so sure: that horse is not mych to be mysselyked, which that with corage &amp; pryckyng forth in haste, happynge for all his four fete somtyme to cache a fall, geteth vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne lyghtly by hym selfe, wythout

      </gap>. No nor yet that horse to be caste awaye neyther, that getteth vp agayne apace with the cheke of them bothe. Now lyke as wyth the best kynde can I not compare: so of the thyrde sorte at the leste wyse wyll I neuer fayle to be, that is to wyt ryse &amp; reforme my self, whā any man shew me my faut. And as nere as I cā wil I serche thē / &amp; as sone as I spye thē, before any man controll them, aryse, and as I now do myne owne selfe re forme theym. whyche kynde ys you wote well nexte vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beste. But yet on the tother syde, of all myne aduer saryes could I neuer hytherto fynde any one, but whan he catcheth ones a fall, as eche of theym hath caughte full many, there lyeth he styll tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blynge &amp; toltrynge in myre, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spurre nor brydyll can one ynche preuayle / but as though they were not fallē in a puddle of dyrt, but rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb facs="306"/>

      </gap>, and they kycke, and they spurne at hym that wolde helpe theym vppe. And y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is yet a fourth kynde, the wurste ye wote well that can be.</p>
