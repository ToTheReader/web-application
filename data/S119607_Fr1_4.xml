   <head>The Authors admonition to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe right well understand, Christian Reader, that many learned men have hertofore written &amp; set forth many excellent works touching religion: whereupon it may seeme, perhaps, a matter both vaine and superfluous for mee to travell any further therein, for as much as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all hope, that any of my doings can be comparable or neere so good, as that which is already done by others: but like as I thinke their travell and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in holy exercises well bestowed, which have written therein before mee; so shall not <hi>I</hi> mislike them neither, which shall enterprise to doe any thing in the like case after mee: the very endeavour it selfe, being good, is alwaies to be born
<pb facs="9"/> withall, and not to be misliked: such is my judgement of the writings of others, therefore <hi>I</hi> stand in this hope, that others also may judge the like of mine; because they may all turne the diligent Reader unto some profit, if it be reverently used, and may much profit all faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, towards the understanding of holy Scriptures, and the exercise of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, it may so fall out that those points which be to seeke, and wanting in this worke of mine, may be found in others. Againe, it is possible that some things which be not once touched by any one of my Authors, may be found expresly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down by me: &amp;, that matter by them handled in their workes is somewhat intricate, and not in the weake capacity of simple people to comprehend, for whose Christian good these paines of mine were principally undertaken: which is by me in a briefe and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious manner expressed and set downe, that the weakest capacity may rightly understand the true sence and meaning
<pb facs="9"/> thereof, to the glory of God, and to the consolation of their owne soule. Againe, many people that cannot spare much money, to buy many bookes of great volumes of sundry Writers, may spare a little to buy this little tractate, wherein is comprised the substance of their works tending to my purpose, sufficient to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; wherein thou mayst behold the back-parts of God thy maker and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and see the glory of Christ thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and mediatour,<note place="margin">Psal. 34.8.</note> and taste of the sweetnesse and consolation of God the holy Ghost, thy Comforter and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, with the duties of Christianity and Humanity, civill and morall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with many singular and excellent things of speciall note, worthy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The manner is plaine, but the matter is holy, excellent and heavenly: and if it be heedfully read, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and carefully followed, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually applyed, it will conduct thee in thy progresse with alacrity, through this vale of teares, this worlds miseries, in
<pb facs="10"/> the Scriptures narrow path to heaven, the desired Port, the celestiall Canaan; for this is but our sea, but eternity is our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but have a care that thou doest not croud with the godlesse multitude in the broad way to hell;<note place="margin">Wisd. 5.</note> take heed, walke cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: for the way is dangerous, craggy, and irksome, full of windings and turnings out, and many allurements in the way to hinder thy passage: about the midst of thy progresse, in the later end of this first part, thou shalt finde the meditation of the discription of Hell; which if by faith unfained, and hearty repentance, thou shalt escape the danger prescribed;<note place="margin">Esay 40.4.</note> all difficulties are then removed,<note place="margin">Luke 3.5, 6.</note> the vallies shall be exalted, and every mountaine and hill laid low: whatsoever is crooked shall be made straight,<note place="margin">Baruch 5.7.9.</note> and the rough shall be made plaine; goe on with a godly and Christian courage, and thou shalt attaine to the end of thy progresse; but take heed to the first step of thy youth: for the first step thou settest out of the way in thy youth, thou steppest into the suburbes of
<pb facs="10"/> Hell; and if thou goest on in thy sins to the next step of thy middle age, thou art at the very brinke; but if thou perseverest and goe on to the next step of thy old age without the mercy of God, and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, thou art plunged in the very depth of hell, the pit of perdition,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.13.</note> the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomelesse gulfe, the fiery lake; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in thy youth have a carefull and heedfull care to thy life and conversation, that thou doe not step out of the right way: for if thou beest once out, it is a hard matter to finde the way in againe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grace of God assist thee, and his providence conduct thee: For the soule of man is dearely beloved of God her father; yet for her sundry good graces, she is often and many waies tempted of the divell by three divers meanes,<note place="margin">In youth with lechery, in manhood or middle age with pride, in old age with covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, three pernicious sinnes.</note> at three severall ages in this mortall life; if she resist and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the same, she is thereby adopted to the full fruition of eternall happinesse, through Christ our Lord, which God of his mercy conduct so many as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="11"/> to his kingdome in the right way to their lives end, and in the end bring them to the end of their progresse, thy everlasting kingdome, the celestiall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, the haven of happinesse; now the Lord prosper this worke, direct our hearts aright, and blesse the labours of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to the glory of his name, through Iesus Christ our Saviour, <hi>Amen.</hi>
