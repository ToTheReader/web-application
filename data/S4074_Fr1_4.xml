      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any <hi>Grace</hi>
(and if not
<hi>Grace</hi> what
else?) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
so to bee
cōmended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people
of God, as they may bee set on fire,
with desire of it, till their desire
be satisfied; surely among, and aboue
all other Graces, the <hi>Mother</hi> and
<hi>Nurse-grace,</hi> the <hi>Queene</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Grace,</hi> which bringeth
foorth, and breedeth vp, that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
and cherisheth, that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and ordereth all other <hi>Graces,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
euen FAITH deserueth as much.
FAITH I say, which is to the
soule, as the soule is to the body. <hi>The
life of it:</hi> &amp; to the little world, as
the Sun is to the great world, <hi>The
light of it:</hi> that which warmeth,
quickneth, comforteth, encourageth,
the person in whom it is. Doth it
not then deserue the best pains of the
most iudicious, and industrious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
to set it out? Great paines hath
beene taken hereabouts by men of
good note and name. So much, and
so well hath beene vttered and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
on this subiect since the latter
spring of the Gospell, as to vtter and
publish any more, may be thought to
doe no more then what hath beene
done before: yet without preiudice to
any other, to the praise of Gods
<hi>Grace</hi> in the Author of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
be it spoken, Neuer any tooke
such paines to so good purpose in and
about the <hi>foundation of FAITH,</hi>
as he hath done. The onely, true,
proper <hi>Groundwork of</hi> FAITH
is <hi>Gods promise.</hi> Whatsoeuer is
<pb facs="10"/>
prnmised may safely bee beleeued,
whatsoeuer is beleeued without a
promise, is presumed. As FAITH
is the life of the soule, so <hi>Gods</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is the life of FAITH. Desirest
thou FAITH? take notice of
<hi>Gods promises.</hi> Wouldest thou
haue thy FAITH, like the light
in the Lords Sanctuary, neuer to
goe out? Acquaint thy soule with
<hi>Gods promises,</hi> know them, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on them, conferre about them:
let them be continually in thy mind,
memory, heart and tongue. If thou
findest it too hard a taske for thee to
finde them out, to ranke them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to make fit application of
them (which is indeede an hard
taske.) Beholde here God hath sent
<hi>Ezekel Culuerwell,</hi> as of olde hee
sent <hi>Ezekel Buzi,</hi> to set out the
<hi>promises of God</hi> more plentifully
and pertinently then euer before: and
that to <hi>breede</hi> FAITH, where it
<hi>is not:</hi> to <hi>strengthen</hi> it, where it is
<hi>weake:</hi> to <hi>settle</hi> it, where it <hi>waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:</hi>
to <hi>repaire</hi> it, where it <hi>decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
to <hi>apply</hi> it aright to euery
<hi>neede:</hi> to <hi>extend it to sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as well as to iustification: and
to point out the singular <hi>vse</hi> of it in
matters <hi>temporall, spirituall,</hi> and
<hi>aeternall.</hi> The subiect matter of this
Treatise is fit to be vnder taken by a
man well exercised in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and well acquainted with the
disposition of mans heart towards
these promises. Such an one is he who
hath penned and published this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
His exercise in the Scripture
hath enabled him to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heapes of promises. His expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the disposition of mans
heart, (hauing piercingly diued
thereinto through much friendly
and familiar conference with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
sorts) hath enabled him to set
those heapes in a fitte and due order.
What I say of him, I know of him;
for from mine infancy haue I known
him, and vnder his ministery was I
trained vp in my younger yeares: hee
being at the least two and twenty
yeares elder then my selfe. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="11"/>
of all the Ministers that euer
I knew, he hath been one of the most
painfull, faithfull, and powerfull,
giue me leaue (good Reader) to set
downe somewhat of his practise for
a patterne to others. What manner
of entring vpon his pastorall charge,
he had, is not vnknowne to them
that were vnder his charge. Very
few, if any at all, did hee finde fit to
receiue the holy Communion: which
mooued him by the space of many
moneths from morning to night, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day in the weeke to instruct in
the first oracles of the word of God,
euery one vnder his charge, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one by one seuerally, and other
times many ioyntly together: which
he did with such successe, as there
were but few that were not able to
giue a reason of their hope to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and so were admitted to the
Lords Table. From which time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
after, so long as hee continued
there, he had weekly meetings in his
Church for all sorts, distinctly on
seuerall daies to catechise them in
<pb facs="12"/>
the Principles of Religion: whereby
(I am perswaded) he did more good
then by preaching, which yet was
very powerfull, and not in vaine. For
as his owne, and his hearers labours,
in teaching and learning abounded,
so God gaue answerable fruits in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the word. For as the
Lords day was very religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
so the foule sins, whereunto
people vntaught are vsually giuen,
were there abandoned, &amp; all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among neighbours so laid aside,
as most louingly they came to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
house. And though there
were many poore, and none greatly
rich, yet did none of the poore begge
abroad for food, but were releeued at
home. Among other euidences of the
power of Gods word among them, I
will record one, a very remarkeable
one, and worthy to bee had in more
frequent vse. It was this: In time of
great dearth of corn and other food,
there was order taken by publike
authority, that euery family should
forbeare one meale in the weeke, and
<pb facs="12"/>
vpon the Lords day bring the value
of it to the collectours for the poore.
This being faithfully performed by
them all, therewith they did prouide
good corne, which cost 8. or 9. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
the bushell, and solde it to the
poore at 12. pence the pecke, and yet
reserueda good stock to set the poore
on worke. These and many other
good works were done vnder his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
who was ready on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to presse the doctrine of faith: so
as the preaching of faith hindereth
not the performance of good works.
This Treatise will giue euident
proofe thereof. Well vse his paines,
and thou shait not lose thy paines.</p>
