   <head>TO the READER.</head>
   <p>REader, my Profession is not versifying, but this is part of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>s power, that he can transforme a Divine into a Poet, and indeed he that cannot make a verse upon this Argument, is an Argument for verses to be made upon. But thou shalt have nothing of a Poem here besides the Ryme, it being this Kings singularity, that he who writeth his History, shall be thought to write a Poem, and he that would write a Poem of him, cannot but write an History. It is impossible, that invention should exceed his actions, or that a Penne should dare more then <hi>Sweden.</hi> So that now an excuse is needlesse, a Divine may write an History. And why not such a Poem? I am sure a Prince in Israel is fallen, and therefore it can be no shame for David himselfe to follow the Beer. Which I trust thou dost in a true sorrow for him, and an harty prayer to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he would raise up another to perfect, who thus farre hath advanc't this royall instument in his cause. Thus thou art advised by</p>
