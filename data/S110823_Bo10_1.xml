   <head>TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, IAMES the Sixt, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Maiesties most humble Seruant, THO. HVDSON, wisheth long life with <hi>euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting felicitie.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S your Maiestie, Sir, after your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vertuous maner was sometime discoursing at Table with such your Domestiques, as chaunced to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;</p>
   <p>It pleased your Highnesse not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to esteeme the peereless stile of the Greeke <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Latin <hi>Uirgill</hi> to be inimitable to vs (whose tongue is barbarous and corrupted): But also to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (partly thorow delight your Maiesty tooke in the Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie stile of those most famous Writers, and partly to sound the opinion of others) that also the lofty Phrase, the graue inditement, the facound termes of the French Salust (for the like resemblance) could not be followed nor sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in our rude and impolished English language. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I more boldly then aduisedly (with your Maiesties licence) declared my simple opinion; not calling to mind, that I was to giue my verdit in presence of so sharp and clear-eied a Censor as your Highnesse is: But rashly I alleadged, that it was nothing impossible euen to follow the footesteps of the same great Poet <hi>Salust,</hi> and to translate his verse (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
<pb facs="456"/>
is of it selfe exquisite) succinctly, and sensibly in our owne vulgar speech. Wherevpon it pleased your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie (among the rest of his works) to assigne me, <hi>The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iudith,</hi> as an agreeable Subiect to your Highnesse, to be turned by me into English verse: Not for any speciall gift or Science that was in me, who am inferiour in knowledge and erudition to the least of your Maiesties Court: but by reason (paraduenture) of my bold assertion, your Maiestie, who will not haue the meanest of your house vnoccupied, would haue mee to beare the yoke, and driue forth the penance, that I had rashly procured. Indeede, the burden appeared heauie, and the charge almost insupportable to me: neuerthelesse, the feruent desire which I had to obtemper vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties commandement, the earnest intention to verifie my rash speaking, and the assured confidence which I ankred on, your Highnesse helpe and correction, encouraged mee so, &amp; lightned on such wise my heauy burthen, that I haue with lesse paine, brought my half despaired worke to finall end. In the which, I haue so behaued my selfe, that through your Maiesties concurrence, I haue not exceeded the number of the lynes written by my Author: In euerie one of the which, he also hath two syllables mo then any English beares. And this notwithstanding, I suppose your Maiestie shall finde little of my Authors meaning pretermitted. Wherfore if thus much be done by me, who am of another profession, and of so simple literature, I leaue it to bee considered by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, what such as are consummate in letters, and knowes the waightie words, the pithie sentences, the polished tearms, and full efficacie of the English tongue, would haue done. Receiue them, Sir, of your owne seruant, this little worke at your owne commandement enterprised, corrected by your Maiesties owne hand, and dedicated to your owne Highnesse. If I haue done well, let the praise redound to your Maiestie, whose censure I haue vnderlyen. If otherwise, let my default of skill bee imputed to my selfe, or at the least my good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention allowed, whereby others may haue occasion to doe
<pb facs="456"/>
better. To your Highnesse consideration, referring Sir, both my diligence done in this smal translation, and the inueterate affection which I haue, and ought alwaies to beare vnto your Maiestie, I commit with all humilitie, your Highnes, your Realme and estate, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of God, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth all the World.</p>
