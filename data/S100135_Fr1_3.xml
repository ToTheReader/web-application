   <head>TO THE WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,
and his ever
honoured friends, the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of his worthy Patron, Sir
Timothy Hutton deceased, both
to his Sonnes with their wives and
Children, and to his Daughters
with their husbands and children:
namely, Mathew Hutton of
Marsk. Esquire, Iustice of peace;
Iames Maulleverer of Arncliffe
Esquire; Iohn Dodsworth of
Thornton-watlasse, Esquire, Iustice
of peace: Edmund Cleburne of
Cleburne, Esquire; Mr Timothy
Hutton; Mr Philip Hutton decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his relict and issue; M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
Iohn Hutton; and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
Thomas Hutton,
Peace &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
book
had beene in
the Printers


<pb facs="3"/>
hands diverse daies ere
ever I purposed any
nuncupation, or dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it at all. At
last, it came into my
minde to addresse it
this way, and that for
these causes. first, out of
honour to your chiefe,
<hi>Arch-Bishop Hutton,</hi> of
whom for his learning,
and gravitie, this great
Encomium was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
given, that hee
was <hi>worthy to sit Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
Secondly, because
I was well ascertained,
my book could receive


<pb facs="3"/>
no smut from you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people of whole
fame for native gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
innocency of
manners, faire deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and uniforme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion.
Thirdly, for that the
most of you are spread
into a goodly posterity
and have faire sonnes
and daughters, unto
whom these things may
bee truely usefull to
ground them soundly
in Religion, so as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abundance</hi> can
<hi>choake,</hi> nor <hi>Indigence</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
ever <hi>starve</hi> in them those
due respects they owe to
divine powers. Would
God parents would at
last be wise, and thinke
it were conduceable to
the hopefull setling of
a child, to aime at more
of <hi>instruction</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
though lesse
of <hi>provision.</hi> Fourthly,
in acknowledgement of
that great love, sweet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
and continuall
intercourses of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
acquaintance which
you were ever pleased
to hold with mee, both
affecting my person,


<pb facs="4"/>
and leaning to my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
farre beyond
the proportion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
Lastly, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the pious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of that worthy
Knight Sir <hi>Timothy Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
your deare Father,
and my most incorrupt
Patron. Into the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of whom being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
I cannot containe
my pen, but to his great
praise I must relate one
or two things of him in
this very regard: first
that comming to settle
his family at <hi>Marske,</hi>
and finding the <hi>Rector</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
there to be no more but
a bare reader, he rested
not till hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
incumbent, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Church with a
preaching Ministery.
And when it was empty
againe by the death of
that incumbent, he most
freely presented my selfe
with out the least request
made in my behalfe to
him, either by my selfe,
or any other; yea hee
besought mee earnestly
to take it, and when he
signed the presentation
he drew with his pen the


<pb facs="5"/>
forme of his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his name and
sir-name. and I can well
take an accompt of my
memory, that the Bpp
of the diocesse, when he
gave institution, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vehemently that I
had the best and most
upright Patron living.
This I say not onely for
his <hi>honour,</hi> but also for
the just <hi>defamation</hi> both
of such <hi>Patrons</hi> (sonnes
of the earth whosoever
they be) as thinke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth would
faile them for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and support, if


<pb facs="6"/>
they should present a
<hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some sprinckling
either of direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
symonie: and also
of such <hi>Clerkes</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
they believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
after they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined
to dust, and yet
dare not trust God for
food and raiment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these indirect and
symoniacall contracts.
But I containe.</p>
   <p>These things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(my much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and most deerely
respected friends) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent


<pb facs="6"/>
unto you, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is worth accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
either in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or function of</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your most affectionate
friend, and
Servant in the things
of Iesus Christ.
