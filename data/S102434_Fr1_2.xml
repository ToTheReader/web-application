                 <title>The high vvay to Heauen by the cleare light of the Gospell cleansed of a number of most dangerous stumbling stones thereinto throwen by Bellarmine and others : In a treatise made vpon the 37. 38. and 39. verses of the 7. of Iohn: wherein is so handled the most sweete and comfortable doctrine of the true vnion and communion of Christ and his Church, and the contrarie is so confuted, as that not onely thereby also summarilie and briefly, and yet plainly all men may learne rightly to receiue the sacrament of Christs blessed bodie and blood, but also how to beleeue and to liue to saluation. And therefore entitled The highway to Heauen. By Thomas Sparke Doctor of Diuinitie</title>

      <pb facs="4"/>beene of this minde, that it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to discharge me of vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by bare wordes (though neuer so ful of kindnesse &amp; thankefulnesse) both in your absence and presence to testifie the same, (whereof yet euer since I first knew you I haue beene carefull and mindefull) and therefore I haue long agoe resolued my selfe (hauing no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes to doe it by,) by dedicating some part of my poore labours vnto you, to giue you and all others, to whom the sight thereof shall come, some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and assured testimonie of my due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and thankefull heart towardes you. Whereupon hauing at the earnest and importunate sute and request of diuers of my worshipfull and good friendes, not long since committed to writing the Treatise following (which
<pb facs="4"/>in effect they first heard me from point to point in this manner deliuer vnto them in certeine sermons) I haue now thought it good in this sort somewhat enlarged to publish it, the better to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their desires: and to the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, I haue made bolde to dedicate the same vnto your Grace, beseeching you to accept therof rather according to the minde of the offerer (which I protest vnto you is full of loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towardes you,) than to the simplicitie &amp; meanesse of the thing it selfe, which I must needes confesse in respect of the handling, is much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of such an Honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone as your selfe is. As for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is (I am perswaded) answerable to the title that I haue giuen it, which is, The high way to Heauen. For therin
<pb facs="5"/>first is shewed howe the lawe is our schoolemaister to Christ, by causing vs to knowe our sinnes, and to feele the weight and burthen thereof to make vs wearie of the same, and therefore to hunger and thirst after him: and then what Christ is in person and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and how he is to be apprehended and fed on to saluation by a true and liuely saith in him, is largely &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared: and lastly also, heerein such as are and haue beene first duely throwen downe by the lawe, and after truelie raised vp againe by the Gospel, in Christ, are taught how they are to liue and spend the rest of their daies in holinesse and righteousnesse. Which I am sure is the olde ancient beaten waie throughout all the whole course of the olde and new Testament, and in
<pb facs="5"/>all sound antiquitie, that the saints and seruantes of God haue taken to be the onelie saife and sure wace, wherby they haue sought to come to the kingdom of heauen. Your Grace therfore being one (as I fullie perswade my selfe you are) that seeke to come thither by this onelie waie, and therefore one also that is verie desirous that all others should walke thitherwards in an eauen and streight course therunto; in respect of the matter therein handled, my good hope is, you will not be ashamed or thinke much at all, that it seeketh thus to come abroad vnder your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance &amp; protection. For though the waie be neuer so well knowne alreadie and be beaten and trode out by manie before this, and that perhaps more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and substantially than it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="6"/>in by me: yet seeing manie are still to go this same way, &amp; all cannot hit of the same guids, &amp; still Sathan wil be busie by his complices eyther to keepe men frō finding it, or by one sleight or other to turne them out of it. I trust that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so manie that haue gone before me in guiding men into and keeping them in this way, this my profered seruice to that end, may &amp; will bee yet profitable vnto many. Now these <hi>24.</hi> years at the least it hath pleased the Lord to vse my poore ministrie, and that, his name be blessed for it, in great peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; yet I haue therin alwaies bene of this mind, and am &amp; will be stil, not to esteeme or know anie thing, but euen this way through Iesus Christ and him crucified. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>2.2.</hi> And sure I am I find and I perswade my selfe I shall still,
<pb facs="6"/>though I cōtinued therin twise as long more, this to be a matter so necessarie and of that importance beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be insisted in and dwelt vpon, that I should neuer haue either leasure or pleasure to trouble eyther presse or pulpit with any thing without the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bondes and strict limites hereof. For (alas) euery where, yea euen where most paines hath bene taken and yet is by catechising of &amp; conference with the people, yea by view of their liues, there is eyther such grosse ignorance heereof, or erring or halting heerein to be found &amp; seene amongst thē, that if all the ministers of England had the tongues both of men and Angels, they should find work inough through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to employ themselues in, onelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reformation heereof. I would
<pb facs="7"/>to God therfore, that all controuersies, wherof men may be ignorant without danger either of not finding, or of not leasing this heauenly way, might either be kept and reserued onely to brotherly and friendlie conferences among the godlie learned, or else that for euer they might be faire dead and buried amongst vs; and that so, that all of vs as one man with one heart and with one mind, might &amp; would ioyne all our forces together to leade men aright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this waie, and to keepe them on streight in the same, what subtiltie and cunning soeuer Sathan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes should at anie time vse to the contrarie. For we may be sure, so that he any way can get men to misse or to lease this waie whiles we are busying our owne heades and the peoples with
<pb facs="7"/>other matters of farre lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though therein we shew neuer so much zeale and learning, he hath the verie thing he desireth. For that doubtlesse hath beene and is still a dangerous stratageme or pollicie of his, when he findeth he cannot as he would preuaile by keeping men in ignorance and carelesse security, then to doe what he can, that they may spend their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and zeale about matters of the least moment; that in the meane time he may the more quietlie by their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in matters of greatest weight, by the other contrary way, as it were paue the waie to Atheisme: yea I feare much (to speake plainely what I thinke) that lacke of due consideration hereof in time, in some hath not onelie beene one of the next causes of the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
<pb facs="8"/>sectes of the Brownistes, and Familistes, but also of too shamefull encrease, in so great light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, both of Papistes and Atheistes amongest vs. Wherefore my heartes desire and prayer to God for England is and euer shall be, and for all the Churches of Christ wheresoeuer in the wide world, that this subtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than may both heere and euerie where be throughlie well lookt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the mischiefe thence ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be as carefully preuented as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie may be: for otherwise it may growe intollerable and vncurable. And J beseech the Lord heartilie to giue your Grace and all the rest of the reuerend Fathers the Bishops of this land, and all others that be in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with you in the same, both skill
<pb facs="8"/>and will, power and might by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his holie spirite speedilie and effectuallie to cleanse and purge these Churches of England and Ireland so, of all these foure kindes of dangerous aduersaries, that without their stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of vs at the first, or seducing of vs afterward eyther of the right hand or of the left, all the rest of vs as brethren and heires of the kingdom of heauen may both happilie get into this way thither, and also most stedfastlie and constantlie perseuere therein euen vnto the verie end.</p>
   <p>Thus presuming (as you see) of your Graces curteous and friendlie acceptance both of this my trauell in pointing out this waie, and also of this my bold dedicating the same vnto you: J will not cease to praie vnto God to
<pb facs="9"/>requite and recompence seauen-folde into your bosome both this &amp; all your great and vndeserued former fauours towardes mee. And thus beseeching him also long to preserue you in health and honour to his glorie, the Churches good, &amp; to your owne euerlasting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now &amp; euer; crauing also pardon for this my boldnes, and hoping therof, I most humblie take my leaue. From Blechlie in Buckingham shire. <hi>1596.</hi>
