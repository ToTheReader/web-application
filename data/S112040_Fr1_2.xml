   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Psalme is a liuely, and expresse picture, representing a soule discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at the sight of his sinnes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the feare of the wrath of God, and looking for the due stroake of vengeance. And therefore, vpon bended knees lifteth vp the hands for mercy. Now because, in the greatest Saints, liuing vpon earth, a valley of teares, a place of temptation, there is the flesh and the spirit, and those contrarie one to another, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath. 5.
17.</hi> this is not effected without great strife, wherefore the holy Ghost, layeth out here, two opposite passions, most plainly; Feare in respect of euill-deseruing sinnes, and hope in regard of vndeserued mercies: for the Treatise it selfe, it is mixt, partly a Prayer, partly an Exhortation. In the prayer the Prophet sheweth his faith and hope. Faith, in that striuing against despaire, he putteth vp his supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and complaint, Generally, expressing his distressed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. <hi>Out of the deep places I haue called vpon thee O Lord:</hi> particularly, desiring release of punishmen <hi>Lord heare my voice.</hi> And discharge of his sinne. <hi>Let thing eares attend to the voice of my prayers,</hi> (suiters for pardon and mercy,) for so the word signifieth. Amplified by the causes, mans sinne deseruing, expressed by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
<pb facs="2"/> If thou O Lord markest iniquites, who can stand? of Gods vndeserued mercy,
<hi>But mercy is with thee.</hi> Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the end: that thou maiest be feared. This for his faith, for his hope, beeing perswaded that God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull: he first layeth it downe absolutely, I haue waited on the Lord. And this is enlarged from the efficient, that it is not a formall protestation of the tongue, but a sincere reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the heart. <hi>My soule hath waited,</hi> from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. <hi>I haue trusted in thy word,</hi> that is, in the sweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of pardon of sinnes from the constancie and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, comparatiuely expressed in a liuely picture, and excelling in a higher degree, that whereunto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, <hi>More then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.</hi> Hitherto the prayer. The second Generall part is an Exhortation to the whole Church, in which there is

         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, what it must doe, and the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, wherefore doe so, for the first the dutie expounded, or matter subiect of the Exhortation, it is waiting. Waite? wherein, be considerable, the person who must waite? Israel? and vpon whome? The Lord. For the second, wherefore, in it two reasons motiue, one Generall for with the Lord is mercy, amplified by the quantity <hi>Great,</hi> and by the quality <hi>Redemption.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular by way of application, wherein the Acte, and he shall redeeme Israel, and the extent, from all his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And this is the resolution and summe of the whole Psalme, the specialties are farther laied out in the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery part by it selfe.</p>
