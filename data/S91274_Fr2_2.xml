   <head>To the right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and my verie good friendes, sir <hi>William Peliam</hi> Knight, her Maiesties Lieuetenant of the Ordinance; and the Ladie <hi>Dorothie</hi> his wife, <hi>T.VV.</hi> wisheth in this life, all sound knowledge of Gods trueth, with an assured fayth in the trueth of his promises: and after the wearisome dayes of this pilgrimage shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eternall bl ssed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the life to come, through Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongest many reasons, (need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse nowe to rehearse) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing mee, to offer this smal Treatise vnto your Worshippes; this was not the least, to weet, that thereby, I might testifie, as my vnfeigned good will
<pb facs="55"/> towardes you in the Lord, so the care that I haue in all holy loue, to buyld you vp in the sincere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pointes and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christian religion. For, though I doubt not, but that you are in some good measure endued, with sundry good giftes and graces form God, which should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall spurres and prouocations vnto you, to imploy your selues to the vttermost of your powers, in the seruice of his Maiestie, and the obedience of his will: yet, in respect of the corruption of mans nature, and the stumbling blockes, which Sathan our common aduersarie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in our way, to hinder vs, in the rase and course of godlinesse I know that all Gods children, and therefore you amongest the rest, haue neede of continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, not onely to put you in minde, but also to prouoke you, to passe the dayes of your pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the reuerent feare of Gods great Maiestie: and being sound in zeale, sincere in knowledge, and carefull in practise, to finish your course in his fayth, that so at the
<pb facs="55"/> last, you may be made thorough Christ, partakers of eterrall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the end of our hope a d fayth, yea, the verie ende of our life in this life: and therefore good reason, that wee should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our whole life thereto, and to the continuall vse &amp; practise, of all the meanes that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for our better attayning thereof, and namely that we should be often and earnest with him in prayer: that we should delight in, and labour to profite by the daily hearing, reading, meditating, and conference of &amp; in his holy word; and that wee should frequent the reuerent and ordinarie vse of his Sacramentes, appoynted for the strengthening of our fayth, in the trueth of his promises, growing, euen to this narrownesse and streightnesse of onscience, that we should thinke euery day and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hower of a day ill spent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue not profited somewhat towardes godlinesse and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</p>
   <p>True is it, that here is handled but onely one poynt of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb facs="56"/> yet notwithstanding, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Worshippes, by this to gather the readie good will that is and shall bee in mee, through Gods goodnesse: further to write or speake, in this, or any other ground, whereby your knowledge may be increased, and your fayth strengthened in the trueth of Gods eternall Word and Promises: yea, I doe further request you, and in you, all those that shall read this little Discourse, to consider, not the smalnesse of the Treatie, but the waightinesse of the matter propounded in the same, which is one of the principles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein wee cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt without our great hurt: and to which wee can not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily repaire (a fault ouer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in these our dayes,) without iudgement and condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our owne soules: which hath made mee to annex at the ende thereof, sundry short medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, for the better direction of the ignoraunt and vnskilfull in this behalfe.</p>
   <p>In all this that I write, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="56"/> it bee, I deale with them (I hope) that be both charitable and wise inough to conceaue my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and therfore shall not neede to vse many words to perswade that, wherevnto you your selues bee in some measure, thorough Gods goodnesse, inclined, and to the perfourmaunce whereof you are bound, by the great grace and excellent calling, that the same God in mercie hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</p>
   <p>This onely I wish, and will pray or, all the dayes of my life, that this my poore labour, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer other thing else it shall please him, by me or any other to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, either for your good, or the good of his Saintes wheresoeuer, may be profitable, not vnto you onely for your saluation, but vnto all his elect and chosen children, that the number of his faythfull being accomplished, and the dayes of sinne vtterly cut off, wee may be gathered to those eternall and heauenly Tabernacles, which Christ our sauiour hath purchased and prepared for vs: and that wee
<pb facs="57"/> might be the better assured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is entred before hand there into, to take possession thereof in our name: there to raigne with him for euer, and euer. So be it.</p>
