   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>GOod Reader, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be saued by thy faith in Christ, after death: thou must here liue by it before death. And faith for the time of this life, hath two great vses. The first is to cut off worldly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and cares. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fashion of men, to multiplie their cares out of measure, and thereby to make their liues most miserable. For first of all, beside necessarie labours, they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them many needelesse and superfluous businesses. Secondly their manner is, to care not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the labours to be done, but also for the euent and successe of their labours, that they may alwaies prosper and neuer be crossed: but this care belongs to
<pb facs="3"/>
God alone. Thirdly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not themselve; with their lot and condition, but seeke by all meanes to increase their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and to make themselues rich. Lastly they exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not onely in disposing of things present, but they forecast many matters in their heades, and plotte the successe of things to come. Now faith, when we haue done the works of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings according to the prescript of the word of God, saith (I say) makes vs commend to God the blessing, successe, &amp; euent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by prayer and affiance in his promises, not doubting but he will giue vs all things necessary. And if we want the blessing and successe we looke for, yet faith makes vs to renounce our owne desires, and in silence to quiet
<pb facs="3"/>
our hearts in the good pleasure of God. And thus many worldly cares are cut off.</p>
   <p>Secondly, when a man at his wits ende, knowes not what in the world to doe, being (as it were) plunged into a sea of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, faith giues direction and staies the minde. For when all temporall things faile vs euen to the very skinne and life, faith preserues within vs an affiance of the grace and mercie of God, and the hope of life euerlasting. Faith shewes vs hidden things not to be discerned by sense and reason. Life euerlasting is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vs, but we die for al that: we heare of the resurrection, but in the meane season we rot in our graues: we are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced blessed, but yet we are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with infinite miseries:
<pb facs="4"/>
bundance of all things is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but for all this we often hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst: God promiseth to heare vs and to be present with vs, but he seemes oft times to be deafe (as it were) at our cries. Now then comes faith, which is the substance of things hoped for, and makes vs lift our minds aboue the whole world, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the inuisible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable things of God which he hath reuealed and promised vnto vs. These things I shewe more at large in this small trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following; read it at thy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, vse it for thy good, and see thou be a doer of them.</p>
