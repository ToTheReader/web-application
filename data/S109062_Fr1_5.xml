      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>VSTVS LIPSIVS, a man of learning enough, but too much leuity, hauing run ouer all religions; &amp; at last set vp his rest in <hi>Popery:</hi> fell in his declining and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting daies to open <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And as he neuer troubled himselfe much with Christ in his life (whose very name a man shal seldom find in his books) so at his end, wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting matter (it seemes) to magnifie Christ, he writes 2 books in praise and honor of 2 Idols: namly 2 old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or 2 new forged pictures of a woman with a child in her armes. Which must needs be taken for pictures of our Lady: Wherin the prophane wrerch blusheth not to write, that at these 2 Images, there are more &amp; greater miracles wrought, then the scriptures speake of to bee done by Christ himselfe. A learned low-Country Diuine wondring that such Owles durst flie
<pb n="4" facs="8"/> abroad at Noone light, and such trompery be set to sale in these dayes of knowledge, wrote a short re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proofe of the impieties vttered in the first of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> bookes, which is:</p>
   <q>De Virgine Hallensi.</q>
   <p>Wherein because the Iesuits were also touched, as being the fathers of such fooleries, and the makers of those bolts which such fooles as <hi>Lipsius</hi> doe shoote: Thereupon a Iesuit of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> calling himselfe <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Bonarscius,</hi> (but his true name being <hi>Carolus Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banius)</hi> taking vpon him in a Iesuiticall pride, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall quarrell of the whole order of Iesuits, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to defend their innocency, and their honor (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) against all the world: and to that end writes a book, and calls it, <hi>The great Theater of the Iesuits honor.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Amphitheatrum Honoris. In quo Caluinistarum in Societatem crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones <hi>iugulatae.</hi>
   </q>
   <p>Wherein, after many blasphemies against Christ: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies &amp; slanders against princes: all kind of lyes against our ministers &amp; professors: he comes at last to defend their friend <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and his legend of our Lady of Hall: And after he hath abused him that wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, with all despightful tearmes, and rayl'd most artificially, wherein he excels all other Iesuits, <hi>(Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> excepted) as far as they, all other Papists: Hee makes a transition frō rayling on men to playing with God: and from disgracing Princes to dallying with
<pb n="5" facs="8"/> Iesus Christ: and not onely defends the legend of <hi>Hall,</hi> written by <hi>Lypsius,</hi> but further to shew his owne deuotion, he makes a Poeme, not to the honour of God, or of Christ the Mediator: but to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Hall</hi> and the child Iesus. Wherein, whether the verse be better or the matter worse is hard to tel: But whether his deuotion therin is greater to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or his blasphemy against the blood of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, let the Christian Reader Iudge, by the Poeme it selfe, which hereafter followeth.</p>
