   <p>GENTLE Reader,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this myne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
      </note> I am nowe to craue this fauour of thee, that I may be so bolde, as to present thee with such an argument, as of the verie nature of it, is not so welcome to those that are of a quiet and peaceable disposition: such also as my selfe do so little like of, that neuer yet did I medle therewith of myne onwe accord: hauing otherwise business enough, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind, that is sufficient to occupie me. Howbeit, it is needefull also, that the aduersarie be answered, and that the weakenes of their allegations (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might seeme to be strong) be euer discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that others be not shaken thereby. And seeing that I am nowe by this occasion drawne forth to this kind of argument, and withall haue left me good store of matter to goe against, I could do no lesse then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer my call in this kind also. The matter is this. A few yeeres since I somewhat purged, and afterwarde published (as it is sufficiently known vnto manie) the Booke of <hi>Resolution</hi>: the rather to prouoke those discontented countrimen of ours, to gather themselues to more moderate waies, and to better agreement in the cause of Religion: as in my Praeface I had noted before. To which end also I was not so curious in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, but willinglie left whatsoeuer I thought might tollerably stand: and somewhat further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them also, I adioyned thereunto an other little Treatise tending to Pacification. Since which time the same <hi>R. P.</hi> that had set it foorth so corruptly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath not only set it forth so again: but also hath
<pb facs="3"/>
much increased it, with those common fragments of their moth-eaten Poperie: &amp; with some other both discourses &amp; vagaries besides. Howbeit, he hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the title, and hath framed another so grosly vnto it, that of whom soeuer he borrowed the best part of the former: yet may you be sure that the title of this latter Booke is his, without any question: For beeing weary of the former title, that made the whole matter no more but a Christian exercise (as in deede, beeing purged, it might rightly be termed so) vpon a smal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he iustleth that aside, out of the way: &amp; being very impotently caried with a Pharifaiacall zeale, to aduance the righteousnes of workes, against the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and merits of Christ, hee must needs haue this <hi>Christian Exercise</hi> in the way of godlines, to be a <hi>Directorie, guiding men vnto saluation,</hi> and yet <hi>Christian</hi> too: as though Christ had come downes from heauen, to teache vs to seeke our saluation (at least in part) in our own righteousnes: &amp; not only in his death and merits, without any thing els to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled withall, in that account. The additions also that he hath put therunto, doe seldome answer the former platforme: some, of argument good enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but not so fitly agreeing to the matter that hee had in hand: others, that draw neerer to the matter that was to be handled, but weake in themselues, and in many places to so little purpose, that he doth nought els oftimes but fetch certain idle careers about it. A booke that was much (vntil they had seene it) desired of many, vpon the hope that by the former was concea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of it: but once being had, so little answering their expectation, that accordingly it findeth (euen among the most of themselues) but smal estimation: &amp; being so corrupt a thing as it is, &amp; almost as incorrigible as
<pb facs="3"/>
the Ma. himself, I mean not to wast my labor about it.</p>
   <p>In the Praeface of which booke,<note place="margin">
         <hi>That the Aduersaries haue it their common maner to make much a doe about nothing.</hi>
      </note> &amp; in certaine of his Annotations theron, he much inueigheth against me, and it passing angry for medling so far as I did with the former. But it is vpon so litle ground, &amp; to so little purpose withal, that for a time I could in no wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe, that it were any better then lost labor, to make him answer: both because the matter it selfe was of no importance, that he laid to my charge, but in al places (to speake of) answereth it selfe: and because the booke likewise was of smal account, nor had, but of few of their own fauorites: &amp; among them also could litle be suffered to come abroad. But yet one other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect there is, wherein at length I was perswaded to make him answer. For it is not vnknown (almost vnto any, in these daies of ours) what greeuous complaints they make against vs, howe boldly and resolutly they cleere themselues, and charge vs, almost in all thinges that goe betwixt vs: as plainly appeareth in their Rhemes Testament for altogether: &amp; in their seueral writings besides, for euery one a part by themselues. Wherein it is a world to see, with what faces &amp; bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of speech they auowe, those foolish &amp; wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of theirs (that without question are only Romish and most schismatical, yet notwithstanding) to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Catholike: &amp; the truth of Iesus Christ, as it was by himself, &amp; by his Apostles deliuered vnto vs, to be no better then plain heresie: and, for those wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises that of late they haue so busily imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues about, how some of them deny those things that were as cleere as the light of the sunne, others iustifie those that are most wicked &amp; trecherous in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree: and, when some of them are punished for those their demerits, &amp; yet but in very moderate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="4"/>
and but so farre as vrgent necessity required ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet notwithstanding they cry out of such persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as neuer was heard of. Which writings of theirs what man can read (that is not before acquainted with their maner of dealing) but that needs he must yeeld some credit vnto them? although he can think that all is not true: yet so bold speeches as those, must needs breed a perswasion with some, that there is some great cause that so they complain: or at least somwhat there is wherein they are iniured. So that when as now they find by experience, they are not able by learning to shew it to those, that can examine their speeches by learning: the next that remaineth is, by out-facing &amp; boldnes of speech to retain such credit as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the harts of those, that they know will examine nothing they say, &amp; yet neuertheles beleeue that it is as true as the Gospel. Now that they see, that there is no place for the Kingdom of the Beast in the harts of those that examin all things by the word of GOD before they beleeue them: what other way is left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but to establish his throne only in such, as wil beleeue whatsoeuer they say, &amp; neuer make any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it?</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>This aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of mine to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the same course likewise.</hi>
      </note>Of which kind of out-facers &amp; liberal speakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this aduersary of mine is one (and so doth shew himself very plainly, in this which he hath doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me) although the matters be not great, that in this priuate quarel of his do lie betwixt vs, yet because it may serue well inough, to shew their maner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in such quarrels as they vse against vs, I saw no cause to refuse the occasion that himself hath offered, and so to put him in mind of his doings therin, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also may so much the better see, what to think of the lauish speeches, high wordes, and great out-cries of
<pb facs="4"/>
him and his fellowes for these matters. And the more angry that he and his fellowes do now shew themselus to be, and the more impatiently that they do, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they doe, the plainlier do they bewray themselues vnto those, that can rightly decypher whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth: that is, from an euill &amp; a desperate cause. Leesers, I grant, are by common prouerbe allowed to haue their words: yet when they are so very impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, &amp; that for the veriest trifles that are, it is a faire and likely coniecture, both that their wine in spent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, when as now they draw forth nothing but lees: and that they haue but smal store of breade, when as they eate Akorns so fast &amp; hungerly as they doe.</p>
   <p>Which that thou maist the better perceaue in this aduersary of mine,<note place="margin">
         <hi>In what maner this my answer in framed vnto him.</hi>
      </note> &amp; in this quarel which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp against me, I haue made him this answer that now I do present vnto thee: it may be, not in so large and ample maner as some would require, but (I trust) both sufficient to note the matter aforesaid, &amp; strong inough for mine own defence in those my doings. The controuersies of purpose I haue euer auoided (I meane for any set Treatice of them, but only so far as did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain vnto mine own needful defence) both because I am wel eased already therof by many, that can dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse them much better then I: and for that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie himselfe, that of purpose doth still enterlace them with other matters, yet himselfe will neuer seeme to haue it his purpose to medle with them. And yet in truth, it seemeth to be the only cause, why he woulde seeme so to deale in matters of godlines: that so, wher as otherwise by learning himselfe dooth know, that he could neuer be able: yet vnder pretence of treating but only of godlines of life, he might win some credite to those popish errors, that hetherto for their pompe
<pb facs="5"/>
and bellies they haue sought to defend. And therfore lesse maruell, that he was so maruelous angry, that I wiped out those his popish coruptions out of the former booke so much as I did: because it crossed his secrete purpose, &amp; did not suffer him so quietly to enioy that silly help, that now he thought meetest, whereby to let in their naughty errors. Insomuch that heerby they teach vs to beware of their Poperie, not only in such bookes of theirs, as wherein they professe to treat of those matters: but in the residue to, wherein they would in no wise seeme to medle with them, but for to treat of godlines only. And to the end that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test the better perceaue, what are those places wherin he findeth himselfe so much greeued, for this cause I haue praefixed those bookes againe before this myne answer: and in the margent of those places against which he inueigheth, haue noted vnto thee, in what part or Section of this myne Answer I haue treated therof. That so thou mayst the more readily find, both what grounds he hath taken of this his quarell: and how weake they are to beare the burthen that theron he hath layd. This is the effect of my Answer vnto him: which also thou hadst had the last Sommer, but that the Printer (after that it was deliuered into his hands) desired, for one matter therunto appertaining, a further respite. But I trust that now also it commeth not out of season: and such as it is that do I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thy fauorable censure &amp; interpretation, and so bid thee hartily wel to fare in Iesus Christ. From Bolton-Percy in the auncienty of Yorke. </p>
