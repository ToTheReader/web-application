   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou wilt I hope impute it in some part to the condition of the time, that I giue thee this answer not altogether so well featured and shaped as thou haply wouldst desire it. Though it be a fruite that may seeme to haue bene long in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet as the case standeth with me, the length of time hath but serued to bring it to his greatnesse, and therefore howsoeuer it commeth forth with defiance to the aduersaries, yet I confesse it seemeth to me not so throughly digested and seasoned as I would haue wished it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee. In this defence of Gods truth, the things that are speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be respected against the importunitie and aduantage of our aduersaries, are strength and expedition. I haue had care, as the matter would permit, to satisfie thee in both these respects, and let my care herein obtaine pardon of thee, if I seeme vnto thee to faile in some complements otherwise. If thou thinke this my answer needlesse because another man hath already taken paines therein, thou must remember that no mans priuate preuention could yeeld me dispensation to be free from doing that which publike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required of me. I doubt not but in the reading of either, it shal appeare vnto thee what spirit it is wherewith these Romish factors are led in their opposition against vs, and that it is not truth and
<pb facs="5"/> sauing of soules whereto they bend themselues, but onely the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of their faction; whether by truth or falshood, by right or wrong, it skilleth not, so that that may be performed. That thou mayst the better see and iudge of all, I haue inserted the whole text of Doctor <hi>Bishops</hi> booke, altogether condemning that falshood and guile which he hath vsed towards M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and they al vse in their pretence and shew of answering our books, in that they neuer set downe the copie of that to which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Which policy serueth them to blind the Reader, and to gaine libertie to themselues to conceale and dissemble what they list, to peruert, to vilifie, to falsifie, and by absurd imputations to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate without being controlled. As our fidelitie and good conscience of the cause which we handle, manifestly appeareth in that we neuer forbeare to publish our aduersaries bookes to the world, when we haue adioyned an answer to them; so their guilt and guile is manifest by the contrary, for that they feare to put forth our bookes with their answers, as doubting least the bookes being at hand should bewray and shew the vnsufficiencie of the answers. As for Master <hi>Perkins</hi> booke, being loth too much to increase the greatnesse of the volume, I haue forborne to put it in, the rather for that the substance thereof for the most part may appeare by that that Master <hi>Bishop</hi> hath set downe, and where he faulteth, I haue taken occasion in my answer to declare, if not the words yet the summe and effect of it, the booke it selfe also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing easily had by any that is desirous more exactly to compare them. The authors conceit for the forme and maner of that work was greatly to be approued, and whereas it hath had the liking of very many for the briefe and plaine deliuery of our controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siall grounds, they shall see now that it was not without cause that they caried so good opiniō of it, inasmuch as the malice of an enemie out of their <hi>many large volumes</hi> can find so little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of waight and substance to say against it. I doubt not but it
<pb facs="6"/> had bene well that in some places he had giuen it some better strength, but it is to be considered, that as the midwife iudgeth better of the birth then the mother that trauelleth with it, and in gaming, the stander by sometimes seeth more then he that playeth, so it is in writing of bookes, that the Reader and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner seeth sometimes a defect, where the busied and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled minde of the writer obserued none: and therefore of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers and men indifferent, it is to be expected that that which it somewhat vnperfectly deliuered in one place, be no impeachment of that which is sufficiently fenced and fortified in another. Thou shalt finde it (gentle Reader) to haue bene so written, as that Maister <hi>Bishop</hi> is faine to vse verie shamefull and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shifts to giue shew of answer to it. Do thou learne hereby to loue the truth, which thus triumpheth in the aduersaries owne campe, and euen in their owne bookes insulteth ouer them, whilest either perforce they subscribe it, or shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so exceedingly distressed to resist or stand against it. Take no offence whosoeuer thou art at the continuance of this fight, because the order must stand which God set downe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning betwixt the Woman and the Serpent,<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note>
      <hi>I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie betwixt her and thee, betwixt her seede and thy seede;</hi> and therefore there shall neuer want<note n="b" place="margin">2. Thess. 3.2</note>
      <hi>absurd or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable men,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.2.</note>
      <hi>hauing their consciences seared with a hote Iron,</hi> with whom no euidence of truth shall preuaile to make them desist from oppugning the seede that is contrarie to them. The beginning of which absurditie is to be seene in wicked <hi>Cain</hi> towards his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> whom the voice of God personally speaking to him could not diuert from that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice whereby hee had intended the destruction of his brother. The succession whereof we may behold in the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, and Elders of the Iewes, whom neither the innocencie of the life of Christ, neither the authoritie of his doctrine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="6"/> the glory of his miracles, nor any euidence of the hand of God working with him, could any way moue, but that they were stil ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling and quarelling against him, stil accusing and condemning him, and neuer ceasing euen against their owne consciences to fight against him. What maruell is it then that the voice of God speaking to vs in the scriptures, and testifying what the faith and religion is that we are to yeeld vnto him, doth not end the quarel and appease the fury of our aduersaries against vs, but that in a mad conceit of themselues and of their Church, they go on still to make of religion what they list, and with impudent faces labour to perswade men, that howsoeuer in plaine words the Scriptures seeme to make for vs, yet in meaning they are against vs. And surely incredible it were, but that we see it, that men hauing vse of wit and will, should dare in that sort as they do to mocke and delude the word of God. At their pleasure they bring in their abhominations into the Church, and when the Scriptures are alledged against them, they tell vs by lame distinctions which stand one legge in the Scriptures the other quite beside, that the Scriptures meane thus or thus, but in no sort touch that which is done by them, though the verie letter of the text do apparently contradict them. As if the adulterer should say, that the Scripture condemneth not his adulterie with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian woman, but onely that which is with Infidels and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; or the drunkard should alledge that it meaneth nothing of his drunkennesse, but onely of the drunkennesse of them who haue not wherewith to maintaine their drinking. How many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions haue they, whereof there is no greater reason to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then may be giuen of these answers? Now what heresie, what idolatrie, what damnable fancies haue there euer beene in the world, which may not finde meanes for their defence if this licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious kinde of distinctions and deuices may take place? If these mockeries be deemed intolerable in the laws of men, what impiety,
<pb facs="7"/> what wickednesse is it thus to dally with and to mocke the word of God? But the light of the Scripture doth plainly discouer the vanitie of these shifts, and that is the cause why they hate and shun the Scriptures, as the theefe doth the gallowes and the Beare the stake. What a worke do they make, how many deuices do they vse, how readie are they to apprehend euery pretence, to discourage the people from medling with the Scriptures, and to breed in them an vncertaintie and doubt of resting their faith there? But there is no cause for thee to be moued at such bugs and scar-crowes, wherewith these malignant aduersaries seeke to fright thee out of the garden of Iesus Christ, desiring to haue thee rather to continue vpon their stinking dunghils, then to gather the sweete and delightsome flowers that yeeld the sauour of life vnto eternall life. Assure thy selfe, that the most absolute assurance of truth is in the voice of truth it selfe, and thou mayst be secure, that howsoeuer men may speake partially, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thee, yet God who speaketh to thee in the Scriptures, which the aduersary himselfe dareth not denie, will neuer deceiue thee. They pretend great difficulties and obscurities in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but is it a reason for thee to forbeare to drinke and to wash thy selfe in the shallow places of the riuers of God, because there are also gulfes and depthes, the bottome whereof thou art not able to search or sound?<note n="c" place="margin">August. epis. 3.

      <hi>the doctrine thereof
<pb facs="7"/> being so tempered,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Austine</hi> againe, <hi>as that there is no man but may draw from thence that that is sufficient for him, so that he come to draw with deuotion and pietie, as true religion requireth he should do.</hi> When they then seeke to barre thee from the vse of this heauenly light, what canst thou conceiue but that they are the agents and factors of the Prince of darknesse?

What is the reason why those men in that sort seeke to compasse themselues about with the blacke and dark clouds of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the scriptures, but that their owne consciences tel them that their deuotions must needs be descried to be superstitious and damnable if they come to be viewed and surueyed by the light thereof? Now albeit this be the true light<note n="i" place="margin">Ephes. 5.13.</note>
      <hi>which maketh all things manifest,</hi> and the onely sure foundation whereupon we can rest our faith (for what is it what the whole world saith if God say not the same? yet against the importunitie of the aduersarie, and for thy better satisfaction, thou shalt see our assertions and expositions throughly munited and fenced with the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the auncient Church. Wherein although we cannot but say, that by the Fathers and Bishops of those times, many things were conceiued and deliuered amisse (and are not our aduersaries forced, will they, will they, to confesse the same?) yet God hath so prouided, that his truth <hi>ex abundanti</hi> is iustified by them, and no antiquity or authoritie of humane error hath so defaced it, but that still the track thereof euen by thē who somtimes haue deemed somewhat against it, is plainly to be discerned. Yea in sundry arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our faith the whole streame of antiquitie runneth so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely &amp; directly against the doctrine and practise of the Romane church that now is, as that we may wōder at their extreme impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and wilfulnes, who against so cleare and euident testimony
<pb facs="8"/> do still persist in the maintenance thereof. Which, in some part thou shalt see in the treatise here following, and shalt vnderstand according to the occasiō here offered, that howsoeuer they cry with wide mouthes, <hi>The fathers, the fathers,</hi> yet their crie is greater then their strength, and that the Fathers haue not left vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished either of armour to defend our selues, or of weapons to conquer them. And the more to secure thee hereof, I haue set downe the testimonies of the Fathers for the most part in their owne words, either in Latine or translated into Latine, or in the Greeke tongue sometimes where I had the copie at hand, and saw the Latine translation not fitly to expresse the Greeke. I haue had a sincere and faithfull care to deale vprightly herein, and not to trouble thee with impertinent allegations, but onely such as are pregnant and cleare to that purpose for which they are alledged. That God (by whose prouidence this seruice hath befallen vnto me) make the same profitable both to thee and me, and graunt vs by writing and reading to increase in the light and assurance of his truth, that we may more and more see and discerne the frauds of these Mountebanks and iuggling Sophisters, who by insolent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of words, and casting of false and deceitfull colours, take vpon them to be able to charme the world, and by their wits to iuggle all other men beside their wits, treading vnder foote the word of God, pretending the fathers names, and betraying the faith of the fathers, subiecting all religion to their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and saying after the manner of wicked men,<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 12.4.</note>
      <hi>With our tongues we will preuaile, we are they that ought to speake, who is Lord ouer vs?</hi> And thou, O merciful Father, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art the refuge and dwelling place of thy poore and maligned Church,<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 68.18.</note>
      <hi>stablish</hi> for thy names sake <hi>the thing that thou hast wrought in vs,</hi> go forward with the worke which thou hast so graciously begun, to dissolue the captiuity of Babylō, and to free the remnant of thy Church from the yoke of the slauerie and bondage
<pb facs="8"/> of Antichrist, that all stumbling blockes of Popish prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and idolatries being remoued, there may be a way prepared for the returne of the forlorne seede of <hi>Abraham</hi> into the societie of thy people, that thencefoorth we may expect and looke for the comming of thy Sonne Iesus Christ to make an end of these euill dayes, and to gather vs euerlastingly to that hope which in him thou hast set before vs.<note n="m" place="margin">Apoc. 22.20.</note>
