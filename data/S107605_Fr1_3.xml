   <head>THE AVTHORS EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>

      <salute>MOst Christian Reader.</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>Considering the Controversies and bloudy hatred grown betwixt those (who professe themselves Christians) about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for they aspiring to retain these vaine superstitions proceeding from their predecessors: and many also not contented, do invent new Sects, Schisms and Heresies: Others (least in number) divinely inspired, and of God elected, desire to extirpate the Darknesse of Ignorance, thereby to cause resplendently to shine, the Light, and claritie of Truth: But it seemes, that the most dangerous Poyson that Satan useth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate men with the Venym of sedition, and cruell contention and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, derives chiefly from the <hi>Masse,</hi> disguised with some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, masked and covered (peradventure) with a good intention. And although that many heretofore have by sundry faithfull descriptions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to discover to the world the deceitfulnes, error, &amp; blindnesse thereof, yet could they not prevaile, nor give light to their duskish and heavy sight.</p>
   <p>Therefore now, without any passion, I have faithfully extracted, and lively drawne out, from the Volumes of ELASOPOLITANS COMMENTARIES: (It is a large and faithfull description; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the second Volume treates of the Constitutions of great Pontiss, Soveraigne Priests, and Sacrificers, as have been ordained since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, and their true Number, Power, Riches, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; (all for thy only benefit) this sincere Summary of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Masse.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>In this Treatise (though little in appearance) are designed &amp; set downe all such <hi>Sacred Signes, Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> ordained of GOD from time to time: As also the <hi>Corruptions</hi> that have grown successively in the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD: whereby I doe evidently shew the Birth of all <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Jdolatries,</hi> and especially the true Originall of the <hi>Masse;</hi> for the which the world is in great strifes, bloody Contentions, cruell Divisions, Hatred, and lamentable Civile Warres: for some do <hi>Invectivate</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh</hi> against it, alledging that it is newly divised and invented; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it by prescription, and long possession; and thus by such like alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Christian Church is sore afflicted with the yoke and <hi>Terror</hi> of <hi>Sedition.</hi> But if thou art a <hi>Christian</hi> (beloved Reader) of what Sect soever, <hi>Papist,</hi> or <hi>Euangelicall;</hi> I pray thee heartily, for thine owne good, to have patience to read this Worke; for by it thou mayest evidently know, and plainly discover the very truth of whatsoever thou standest in doubt of, what Sacrifices, Sacraments, and Sacred Signes have beene instituted of GOD since ADAM; what is the Masse and Originall thereof; who were her Founders, Augmenters, &amp; Inventers; &amp; to the end thou mayest firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve with assurance, all the Contents herein mentioned, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those Authors out of whose Bookes &amp; workes I have drawne end derived it: their Names and Bookes are quoted in the Margent. So ayming at GODS glory and thy owne Benefit, I rest with my prayers to GOD, to inspire thee with his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by the intercession of our onely <hi>Saviour, Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Mediatour Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>AMEN,</p>
