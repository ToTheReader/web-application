      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE feare of the almighty (through the vvorke of his grace) having novv at last over vveyed in vs the feare of men, vvee have thus farr by the directiō of Gods vvord and spirit strecthed out our harts and hands vvith bouldnes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the name of Christ before men, and to declare to Prince and People plainly their transgressions, that all might heare, &amp; see their fearefull estate and standing, and repent, and turne vnto the lord before the decree come furth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of their visitation be past, and that the thinges that belonge to their peace be altogether hid from their eies: and vvhereas in this vvriting vvee have vvith all humble bouldnes spoken vnto our lord the King, our defence for this is, that vvee are taught of God especially to make supplications, praiers, intercessions, and give thankes for our lord the King: and wee are taught that the gracious God of heaven (by whome the King reignes) would, that the King should be saved and come to the knowledg of the truth, and therefore wee the Kings servants are bound especially by all the godly endeavors of our soules and bodyes to seeke the salvation of the K. although it were with the danger of our lives: for if vvee savv our lord the Ks. person in dāger either by privy conspiracie or opē assault wee vvere bound to seeke the Ks. perservation &amp; delivrance, though it
<pb facs="4"/> werewith the laying downe of our lives, which if wee did not, wee should readily and most worthily be condemned for traytors; hovv much more are wee bound to seeke the preservation and delivrance of the soule and body of our lord the King seeing wee see him in such great spirituall danger as wee do. And if anie shalbe offended at vs for so doeing, they therein love not the King: and if our lord the King should be offended at vs his servants for so doeing, the King therein loves not himselfe: and if all men, and the King should for this be offended vvith vs (which God forbid) yet herein wee are sure our God wilbe well pleased with vs, in that wee have with our best strength and faithfullnes obeyed him, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds and teacheth vs, to admonish all men every where to repent, and this is our sure vvarrant, and our assured hope and comfort. Now as wee have, (according as wee hold our selves bound) thus farr confessed Christs name before men by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, so wee shall (the lord assisting vs) be ready, as wee hold our selves bound to confesse Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men by vvord of mouth, not fearing (through Gods grace) them that kill the body and after that are not able to do anie more. In this duty to God and his people, wee must needs confesse wee have hitherto greatly fayled, but wee will novv be ready the lord strengthning vs rather to be sacrificed for the publishing, of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and for the service of your faith, then to faile as vvee have done both in our dutyes to God and you. This vvee readily vovve to God and promisse to you and to vvill to do this good is present vvith vs,
<pb facs="4"/> but vvee find no meanes in vs to performe this duty and service, &amp; vvee see a lavv in our flesh strongly rebelling against the lavv of our mynds but our assured trust &amp; confidence is, that Gods grace alone is sufficient for vs to make vs every vvay able vnto these thinges, vnto the vvhich of our selves vvee are no vvay able, yet wee vvill say with the holy Appostle Paul, If God be on our side, vvho can prevaile against vs? &amp; vvho shall seperate vs from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish, or persecutiō, or famin or nakednes, or perill, or svvord? no the lord vvee trust in these thinges vvill make vs conquerors: and though our outvvard man should perish, or suffer many afflictions, (vvhich vvee vvere most folish if vvee should not vvait for) yet let the people of God looke vnto the truth vvee vvitnes, &amp; consider vvith holy and vvise harts vvhether vvee have not good vvarrant, yea direct comaundement to do that vvee do, though vve be vnfitt and vnvvorthy for such a service. Shall vvee heare the lord say, Come out of hir my people: and shall the Spirit of God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him, that heareth: say Come: and shall not vvee say Come? Shall the vvord of the lord comaund to Call vp Archars against Babell, and all that bend the bovv to beseig it round about, and let none escape, &amp; to recompence hir the dubl, Ier. 50.29. Reuel. 18. And shall vvee spare our arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves though they be vveake? and shall the Spirit of God say, All yee that are myndfull of the lord kepe not silence Esa. 62.16. And shall vve hold our peace because vvee are not eloquent? No, no, vvee have too long neclected our duties herein, and novv
<pb facs="5"/> through Gods grace vve dare no longer do so: and therefore do vvee thus cry vnto you the people of God, saying Babilon is fallen, she is fallen, Come out of hir, Come out of hir, for if you still partake with hir in hir sinnes, you shal certenly be partakers of hir plagues: and therefore also vvee say. Let him that is a thirst, Come: and let vvhosoever vvill, take of the vvater of life freely: and vvee call vnto all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Archers that bend the bovv, to come to the seige against this great Citié: and vvee pray all that are myndfull of the lord not to kepe silence, nor to give the lord rest, till he repaire, and vntill he set vp Ierusalem the praise of the vvorld. And our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevvall praiers vnto the lord are, and shalbe that the lord vvill enlighten your vnderstandings, and raise vp all the affections of your soules and spirits, that you may apply your selves vnto these thinges, so far as his vvord and spirit doth direct you, and that you may no longer be deceived and seduced by those false Prophetts who prophesie peace vnto you, vvhen vvar and destruction is at the doore, vvhich the lord give both you and them to see, that you may all flie vnto the lord for your delivrance and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
