      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His worke is set out by lightsome speeches, as well of the persons expressed in that heauenly worke of <hi>Iob,</hi> as of some others there implied, following altogether the rule of the diuine Scripture, saue onelie heere in the fore-front, where also it retaineth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the same, and is put out of due place, to bring by way of introduction, all the rest into better forme.</p>
   <p>Diuided accordingly, vnder the name of <hi>Syrraxis,</hi> which properly signifieth the beating together of violent waters, for that the subiect is compounded of nothing else in a manner, then matter of hot contention.</p>
   <p>Subdiuided answerably where the combat hangeth long vpon the hand of some one, by certaine Cumata, or raging waues, which bearing themselues all one way, yet keepe a distance the one frō the other, waite their times and turnes: turbulent indeede euery one, yet not in the like fulnes and fiercenes, because the Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they consist, are such as are all carried with a mightie tempest of words and matter, yet in a diuers manner &amp; measure, neither comming in confusedly, &amp; all at a clap; but in as good order, comlines and due place, as an Army is wont, where it is fought in a pitched field, and the gayning of the day, is the glory of the Nation.</p>
