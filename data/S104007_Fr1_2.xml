   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ir, yow having married the widdowe of my decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vncle, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>: Jerome <hi>Heydon</hi> marchant of London: I am tyed by an obligation of loue, to shewe you al dutifull respect, and for yours, and my Aunts many favours J have made choise to dedicate vnto your selfe, these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, touching the seige of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> &amp; some remarkeable things hapned this last yeres service in the Lowe Countries. And though they be not so well done, as I could wishe they were, because some things maye be forgotten, and others which came not to my knowledge; yet so farre, as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence served, and being an eye-witnesse in the most of them: J hope they will carrye more truth along vvith them, then Eloquence: for truth, and bluntnesse becomes a Souldier best. Here then (worthy S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>:) you shall see everie Nation (as so many rivers runing into the mayne) endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and striving to doe the <hi>State,</hi> and Land service, whome wee serve. One principall motive, vvhich perswaded mee to vndertake this labour, and to putt it out to the viewe of the vvorld was this. <hi>Harmon Hugo</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> wrote well in the
<pb facs="3"/>
praise, and Conduct of the deceased Marques <hi>Spinola</hi> (who deserved well, and was one of the best Generalls that ever the King of Spayne had in his Lowe Cuntrie warrs) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blocking vp of <hi>Breda:</hi> It is as free for mee, being a protestant and a Souldier, to write some thing (without flatterie) as a remembrance to posteritie, in the honor &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of our <hi>Generalissimo</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange.</hi> &amp; if hee pararells, these two great Generalls of our age together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I must tell the Iesuite this, in a Souldiers account a towne, or a citie gayned by the sword, and Approches is more honorable (witnes the seige of the <hi>Bosch,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mastricht</hi>) then to block it vp, and to starue yt out, which is a langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing death. On the contrarie side, because hee spake well of our nation, &amp; gives them their due: I will likewise speake the truth, that wee mett with a brave Gouvernour, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Leyde,</hi> and a daring Ennemie, which disputed every patch of ground with vs, and yeelded not, till the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Bowells of the vvall of <hi>Mastricht</hi> were rent assunder. To concludel, that which I have collected, the severall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices acted, the passages, and remarkeable things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, I leave to your wise, &amp; the judicious Readers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, which I hope wilbe acceptable vnto you, &amp; rest.</p>
