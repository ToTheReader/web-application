THE MODEST APPREN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of LONDON, Schollars, and

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall obiection against publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either this or any other booke of
like argument, hath alwayes beene
grounded (by the most wise and noble)
vpon a feare, that the insolencies of the
youth, and irregular frie of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
would thereby take encrease: which hauing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
beene intollerable (in common pollicie) and in no
little measure scandalous to the Kingdome, were hatefull
to cherish, or to giue the least way vnto. But it hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
beene elsewhere answered; that those Apprentises are
of the dreggs, and branne of the vulgar: fellowes voyd of
worthy blood, and worthy breeding, and (to speake with
fit freedome) no better then meerly rascall; the ordinary
balls, plaid (by the hand of Iustice) into the <hi>Bridewells,</hi>
in or about the Citie: yea perhaps, not Apprentises at all,
but forlorne companions, masterlesse men, tradelesse, and
the like, who preying for mischiefe, and longing to doe it,
are indeed the very Authors of all that is vile; discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to honorable (all trauelling strangers ought to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
vsed as such) rude towards Natiues, seditious
among their owne, and villanous euerywhere. But
you (none of that caitiue and vntrustie number) are the


<pb facs="7"/>
parties, for whom this labour hath been vndergone, whose
behauiours (full of gentlenesse, and of bounden dutie to
superiors) commend you to the present times, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in you that stocke of good hope, out of which are in
due time elected those successions of the whole, which
make the politicall bodie or state of a Citie immortall.
Thinke therefore with your selues, that by how much
this most friendly office tends to your more defence, and
praise, by so much you are the more bound to beare your
selues honestly, and humbly. In your so doing, the Citie
of <hi>London,</hi> which (before <hi>Rome</hi> it self was built) was rockt
in a <hi>Troian</hi> Cradle, by the founder, and Father thereof (as
the most ancient extant monuments, setting all late phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
aside, beare witnesse) heroicke <hi>Brute,</hi> or <hi>Brytus;</hi> vnder
<hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> the Metropolis of the <hi>Trinobants;</hi> vnder
other <hi>Caesars</hi> afterwards, <hi>Augusta,</hi> or the maiesticall Citie;
which, for hugenesse, concourse, nauigation, trade, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity,
very hardly giuing place to any one in <hi>Europe,</hi>
doth absolutely excell all the Cities of the world for good
gouernment, or at least doth match and equall them;
that very <hi>London</hi> so venerable for the antiquitie, so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
for the customes, so profitable for life, noble in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
euen beyond the names both of our Countrey it
selfe, and of our nation, the birth-place of <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great, and inmost recesse, or chamber of her Kings, that
very City, that very <hi>London</hi> whether your locall parent, or
louing foster-mother, shall not grace, or honor you more,
then you shall grace, and honor her, and <hi>England</hi> also.</p>
