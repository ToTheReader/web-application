   <p>WHo so considereth the state of
Princes (although they are as
Gods vpon earth, beeing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
of God, hauing theyr authoritye
from God, and sitting in Gods seate to rule
the sword with the Law, may perceaue that
they liue in more care and greater daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then the simplest subiect. Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
therefore is their late example of the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> slayne (by a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
villain) in his owne Courte: his
death and the manner thereof, may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
other Princes to be carefull, whome
they retaine into the presence of theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Great is thy losse, and greater wil be
thy mysery (O <hi>Flaunders,</hi>) for the want
of thy Prince, who did guide thee and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
thy people, with wisedome, loue,
policie and continuall care for thy quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
he was thy comfort and the stay of
thy state in all extremities.</p>

misse him: the widdowe, the sucking
Babe and the fatherlesse childe shall haue
cause to bewayle his death. Yea rich and
poore, altogether may lament his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap,
and cry woe vpon that man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued
him of life, whose noblenesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
fame, and whose woorthy acts and
enterprises, beeing honourable, are meete
to be registred among the most lawdable
reportes of learned Historiographers. If
the <hi>Romaines</hi> did bemone the death of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> the <hi>Troyans</hi> the losse of <hi>Hector</hi>
and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> the want of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> then hast thou (O <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)</hi>
more cause to lament the losse of thy
good Prince, who with wisedome, force,
and great care, (ayded by the power and
prouidence of God himselfe) did keepe
thy country, from the handes of him that
woulde make a Monarchie of Realmes in
his ownehandes: to the vtter spoile of
thee and thine, &amp; to draw other Realmes
vnder his subiection. O most accursed
wretch that he was, so subiect to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
of sathan, to worke the vntimelye
death of so gracious a Prince, that hether
<pb facs="4"/>
to hath defended your liberties, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
your right these many yeeres, to
the great glory of God, the aduauncement
of your wealth, and the mayntenaunce of
true Religion. It were too tedious to set
downe in what subiection all the Lowe
Countreys of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> hath beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeeres yoked in by their enemies: the
effect whereof is so notorious &amp; apparant
to all the world &amp; the same so truely layd
open by many, that it is heere needelesse
to touche it: as also to handle the great
care of this Prince from time to tyme,
who continually sought to maintaine your
liberties and to defend your Country frō
extreame misery: which doubtles hath
sharply pinched you: and now hauing lost
him who was the principal prop of the Low
countryes, it is like to fall out to the vtter
ouerthrowe, ruine, and destruction
of that poore cominaltye, (a matter
most lamentable) except God (the onelie
defender of those that truste in him) doo
speedely procure and stirre vp, a carefull
and godly Prince to bee the defendor of
that people and Countrey, that there by
<pb facs="5"/>
the Townes and Villages there about may
become populous &amp; thorowly replenished
(nowe greeuously impouerished through
ciuill discention) to the quietnes, wealth,
and peace of the same.</p>
   <p>And considering it is most necessary to
publish a true discourse of this late lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table
mishappe, I haue thought it good
breefely and plainely to set downe the true
circumstaunce thereof: and that for one
speciall cause, which is, that considering
the vntrue imaginations and fayned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes,
of this Princes death, now blased a
broade, as well to his freendes as to hys
enemies▪ the trueth being layd open, and
made manifest to all men, that then those
reports may be accounted fryuolus and to
be troden vnder foote. I therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
you, O yee people of <hi>Flaunders,</hi>
that hauing lost the stay and staffe of your
countrey, that you yet vouchsafe with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to remaine content with GODS
workes, who prouideth wonderfully for
you. It is your sinnes that is the cause of al
your care: wherefore call vpon God in this
<pb facs="5"/>
your time of affliction: and with prayer
and hearty repentance, to turne vnto the
Lorde, who no doubt will deliuer you from
danger: as he did the children of <hi>Israell,</hi>
and assure your selues, that he will so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
your countrey in short time, powring
thereon peace and plenty, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braunce
of your great extremety now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
vpon you, shall in short time grow out
of memory and be made a florishing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth which God the father withall
speede graunt to confirme. <hi>Amen.</hi>
