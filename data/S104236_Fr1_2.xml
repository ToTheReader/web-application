      <salute>Right Worshipfull,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue presumed vnder your worthy Name, to send forth a few Obseruations (such as they are) on the Parable of the <hi>Rich man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> A Scripture that may well beset by the <hi>Preacher</hi> to an age of such ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne as ours is: An age and time, wherein <hi>vngodlinesse,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Preface to the trunesse of Religion.</note> which (as the <hi>(a)</hi> L. of <hi>Plessis</hi> once sayde) was wont but to whisper men in the eare, and lispingly to <hi>speake between the teeth,</hi> doth now most boldly, and without all blush of shame, <hi>with open mouth,</hi> call vpon both <hi>Bench</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi> for protection. <hi>Diues</hi> hath many sonnes at this day, <hi>sprung from</hi> his <hi>loines</hi> of cruelty, and the <hi>contempt of the poore:</hi> and for his <hi>brethren among vs,</hi> they be not<note n="(b)" place="margin">Luc. 16 28.</note>
      <hi>fiue</hi> onely▪ but more then <hi>fiue hundred;</hi> all which, liuing in no feare of God or death, and impudently in all the deedes of sinne, require the sharpest <hi>edge</hi> of Discipline, Gods and mans. Therefore and toward the reformation of so many as God shall incline to reade with some conscience the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I haue (to my poore skill) done somewhat in this fearefull Parable of <hi>Diues.</hi> That little which is done, is <hi>according to the Scriptures,</hi> and humbly commended to your Worship by <hi>One</hi> that doth loue and reuerence <hi>You</hi> for the good parts of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> which are noted to be in <hi>you</hi> by those that know <hi>you;</hi> and appeareth by this, that you spare no trauell, and accept <hi>no faces of men,</hi> or letters in matters of publike hearing, whether <hi>in Terme or out.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>And who can but commend this <hi>mind of yours</hi> in so scarce a world of iust and painefull Magistrates? <hi>Your</hi> piety in Gods matters is testified sufficiently and plainely by <hi>your exemplary</hi> obedience to Gods Sabbothes: where your good affection to the Word, in a louing affabilitie to the Preachers thereof, is obserued and reuerenced by as many as truly know you. And for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of your mind</hi> in Court causes, <hi>you</hi> haue as many <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> as the Court hath eares. And indeed how can <hi>Iustice</hi> badly <hi>follow</hi> that hath so good <hi>fore-leaders?</hi> I write not this to giue titles: onely in <hi>your</hi> person <hi>(Sir)</hi> I desire to stirre vp others of like <hi>place to beare you company</hi> in so good a way of piety, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, and <hi>in corrupt iustice,</hi> if they <hi>be behind.</hi> Also my desire is, by so true a relation of so many good offices and effects of <hi>your chiefe Stewardship</hi> in the Marches performed among vs by <hi>you</hi> (matters which <hi>haue a good report of al men, &amp; of the truth it selfe</hi>) humbly to prouoke you to goe forward in this <hi>narrow path,</hi> wherein sofew now walke, of sincere and conscionable Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy. So shal you one day heare this comfortable saying: Mat. <hi>25.21.</hi> (c) <hi>It is well done good seruant &amp; faithfull.</hi> But I may not say much in the Preface, where so little is sayd in the Booke it selfe: and therefore to conclude, I say, good Sir, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
