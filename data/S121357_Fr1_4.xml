      <hi>place and possessions, hee teacheth thee to charge thy selfe as thy
reuenues will liberally reach, taking heed of pordigalitie; and
stirreth thee vp to the knowledge of the ordering and dressing
of ground, or whatsoeuer other thing: that so thou mayest not
onely see what is to bee done, and how, but also iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
when it is done. If an inferiour person and hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what thou labourest for, lacking also skill, and
so suffering thy field to grow barren: hee teacheth thee all good
meanes for the making of it fruitfull. If for lacke of will,
pouertie come vpon thee as an armed man, know that there
is neuer a precept of paynefull toyle and laborious husbandrie
throughout the whole Booke, but it soundeth an alarum, and
proclaimeth an open defiance against thee as a Sluggard. If
through skill ioyned with will, thou reape the plentifull increase
of a rich Haruest, but abuse it, to the malitious vexing
and troubling of thy neighbour in the Law, or to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the honest and chast liues of Maides, or any of thy
neighbours Wiues, hee calleth thee from such courses vnto the
labours of thy ground: for scarce to take thy lawfull recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at lawfull delights (such as are Hawking and Hunting)
will hee affoord thee any leasure: If a Farmer, hee teacheth thee
kindnesse by deuising something to gratifie thy Lord withall; and
gentlenesse in louingly intreating thy seruants. If thy neighbour
enioy any goodly commoditie of Grasse, Corne, or other dead
thing, or any other liuing thing whatsoeuer that is excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee would not haue thee to looke vpon the same with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,
greedie, and couetous eye; hee calleth thee to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
of such of thine, by teaching thee how to doe it. If thou
bee a seruant, hee willeth thee to bee both painefull and pittifull;
that so all thy businesse may bee well done, and in due time: and the
beasies wherewith thou art charged, may bee tendred of thee in all
mildnesse. And finally, that all vnhonest and disgracefull waies
may bee farre from thee, hee hath taken the paines to instruct
thee in so many things, as that if thou wilt applie thy selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and to doe them well: thou shalt not find the leasure to lend
a thought to the euill that might allure thee. And that he might
not bee mistaken and thought to forget that woman was made
<pb facs="5"/>
for a helper, hee hath called her to her taske, and that neither
little, nor consisting of a few or base things, hauing committed
vnto her (besides many other matters) the cure and charge of
families health. But leauing to speake any more of her charge in
particular, I could wish all such of that sexe as are religious, to
looke before they leape, and to bee wise according to sobrietie and
grauitie: Sobrietie, not medling, aboue their place and reach, in
matters of Physicke: and Grauitie, as not hauing any thing to doe
in the matter of Fukes, either for vsing or preparing of them; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they argue, if not plainely proue, a light, a loose, and very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And finally, seeing that the whole earth was once a Tempe,
an Eden (that is, a place of all pleasures and delights) and
the assigned possession and naturall inheritance of man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to labour and liue in, with exceeding great ioy and felicitie;
and that through their sinne it was cursed, and they were cast out
of the most pleasant, commodious, and beneficiall part thereof:
I could wish them iointly to record such their former felicitie, and
the losse thereof, to the end that they may applie their hearts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wisedome, and learne, that although they doe continually labour,
yet if they wallow in sinnes, they doe but throw downe twice as
much as they build vp, destroy and marre mare they make,
driue farre away the creatures of meate and maintenance, which
they labour so greedily to scrape and pull vnto them, and euen
bereaue the earth (if it were possible) of all manner of fruits
and increase, that so it might not any more either feede or cloth
them: For knowledge, skill, toyle, paine, rising early, lying
downe late, with euery other helpe, doth loose his vertue and
come short of his end, if delight of sinne bee ioyned as a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
therewithall; it being the heauie load and burthen vnder
which all creatures doe grone; the burning ague that drieth all
sappe and moisture; and that cursed seede which causeth them as
a vaporous brood not onely to fret out their mothers bowels, and
bring a curse vpon her bodie; but thereby also to curse and crosse
themselues in all that wherein they would most gladly thriue and
prosper.</p>
