   <head>An aduise for protestants and puritanes.</head>
   <p>IF so it chance that these my simple dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses fall into their hands for whose tastes they were not prepared, I thought good to giue them three or foure aduir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisments, that they remaining without the vineyard of Christ, may thrust their hands through the hedge, and benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at least by the leaues of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, since they cannot be pertakers of the fruite.</p>
   <p>First that I intēded not here to proue by fathers, councells, &amp; scriptures, theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, euery cause as in schooles they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are handled: (the which if I were to deale with heretikes, I could easily performe) but only briefly to represent vnto the peoples eyes for their meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, some pointes appliable to euery ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes capacitie. Neither doe I stuffe the margines with ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ations, because in very deed I lacked bookes: but euery found diuine may wel perceiue, that what soeuer the fathers haue written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the institution and effects of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
<pb facs="133"/> may be reduced into one cause or other. And consequently a little reading would quickly haue filled the margines.</p>
   <p>Secondly, let them consider how maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically, how reuerently, how reasonably Catholikes belieue, téach, and worshippe this sacramēt. And what difference there is betwixt our venerable sacrifice, &amp; their prophane bread and wine. Our sacrament subsisting by Gods sonne incarnate, and their meere tipicall shadowe: our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fountaine, springing graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for life euelasting, and their naked supper, vnseasoned with grace, depriued of vertue, spoiled of religion. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, I cannot see how they can saue it, but that whosoeuer eateth his breakefast saying grace before and after, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth as well, and feedeth as perfectly on Christ by faith as they do. Moreouer who is so blind that cannot discerne howe the pascall lambe and manna, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Christ in the holy Eucharist, were much more excellent sacraments then their communion, because they more liuely represented Christ, the lambe his passion, and manna the fruites thereof, then a gobbet of bread and a sup of wine:
<pb facs="134"/> and consequently the blood of the lambe sprinckled vpon their dores, much more expresly stirred Vp their faith to feed on Christ then a breakfast of bread &amp; wine.</p>
   <p>Thirdly for this argument and many more I find the protestants both in their bookes and conferences most waue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing, and not able finally to resolue themselues what to hold, yet I heare that Doctour <hi>Andrewes</hi> hath publikely preached that Christs bodie is there really, and manie Protestants I know hold the same opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But alas how is it possible for any man to eate the bodie of Christ really, and not corporally, after the māer of Catholikes, defend the bodie of Christ to be really in the sacrament? for howe can it be reallie present, being really distants as far as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from earth? or how can the body haue a reall presence and a corporall absence? it is euen as much to say, as a man may eate really a Capon, and yet none of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Capon, which is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they themselues know not what they say, but fal into manifold absurdities and contradictions: for as many as write of their eating of Christ by faith, differ from others in declaring, how he is eaten
<pb facs="134"/> by faith, and in distinguishing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from a good christian breakfast.</p>
   <p>Lastly let them consider of what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they are depriued, for it seemeth in verie deede that God in punishment of their errors would abandon them, and leaue them destitute of one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefits he bestowed vpon mankind. Alas by lacking this light, they liue in darkenesse, by wanting this cloude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire them from the scorching flames of concupiscence, it is no maruaile if they cannot liue chastly, being spoyled of this sinew of charity, it is no wonder if dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raigne among them, hauing sent into exile these bowels of mercie, for necessity christian charitie fayleth: abandoning the only sacrifice of true religiō: conseqnētly they haue expelled al true deuotion. And therefore wee now proue by experience in England, that fasting is left, praying lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle accounted, mortification reiected, almes brought to nothing, virginity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, Christian pietie deemed hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and in sine, for lacke of this sacrament and true religion brought in fleshly prudence and Atheisme.</p>
