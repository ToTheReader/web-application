   <head>The Noblenesse of the
Asse.</head>
   <head type="sub">Attabaliba of Peru, to the Asse-fauouring
Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit amongst all the kinds of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
creatures, which are
inclosed within the Moones great
concaue, those appertaining to the
earth, are euer reputed more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
then the other that swimme
or flie, and therefore consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are to be reckoned more Noble. Neuerthelesse,
there is no one man knowne, that determinately
hath censured, what one creature among those of
earthly kinde, is to beheld most perfect and noble
beyond all the other. Yet diuerse kindes haue bene
continually at warre amongst themselues,<note place="margin">Beasts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that man might iudge of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse.</note> making
choise of some before the rest, by their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
behauiour: and haue showne the same to man,
to the end he might pronounce the doubtfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Herehence grew the reason, that men of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made election of fiue kinds only,<note place="margin">Fiue kindes of beasts made choyse of.</note> which they
haue opposed against all the other: and those are
the <hi>Dogge,</hi> the <hi>Horsse,</hi> the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Ape,</hi> and the
<hi>Elephant.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But because humane iudgements are wont or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
to bee diuerse and variable, euen as their
thoughts and opinions are of selfesame nature: so
by proofe we find, some to perticularize his fauour
one way, and other some (among these fiue kinds)
to praise as himselfe pleaseth, which in their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
writings is easily discerned. And as I haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
read them, so haue they raised no mean mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in my minde, why no one is found amongst
the number of so many auncient writers that hath
looked into the Asses kinde, finding him to be the
most compleat, perfect, and the very Noblest beast,
among all the rest that nature euer gaue life vnto
in this world.</p>
   <p>And albeit among our moderne men,<note place="margin">VVriters of the Asse.</note>
      <hi>Iulio Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millo,
Pietro Messia,</hi> one called <hi>Academico Peregrino,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Rao</hi> in one of his letters, with another that made
but a digression, haue written somewhat, declaring
diuerse considerable qualities of the Asse: yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the same hath bene so succinctly, or rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully
performed, as they haue rather depriued
then rendered such perfection, as makes him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
the direct sentence, to bee the most Noble, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among
all the kindes of beasts vnreasonable, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
But the worst is, that the foresaid writers haue
shewen,<note place="margin">The fault of the former writers.</note> I will not say little iudgement, but indeed
farre lesse conscience, being so ouer impudently
bold, in seruing their turnes with authorities of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
scripture, to recount the Asses qualities: because
the meaning therof neither should or ought be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Asse-fauouring iestes, which makes them
the more worthie seuere punishment, for inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
haue they giuen to words of the olde and
new Testament, other expositions then should so
be made of them.</p>
   <p>Concerning what I intend to say,<note place="margin">The Authors purpose in his proceeding.</note> I meane to
draw my prooues from sence, reason, authoritie, as
also examples of men skilfull and learned: to the
end, that this age of ours may be throughly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the trueth of the matter I vndertake, not to
leaue buried in blinde obliuion, those admirable
qualities, which makes this beast, not onely more
perfect and Noble then the other, but the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
and Noblest of all other.</p>
   <p>And that I stand fearlesse of murmuring toongs,<note place="margin">The Authors protestation to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>
cutting taunts, first and foremost I protest to thee,
who (with ascancing lookes) make profession of
prying into other mens workes: that in the whole
subiect of the matter, they shall find nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh
against, except after they haue peece-meale
turnd it ouer, they chaunce to light on some error in
the Orthographie. Then ere they offer to teare this
my Asse-defending imprefe, I would let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that I mooued to write it by a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
<pb facs="4"/>
that the fortune hereof would be faire,
good &amp; conformable, to their Asse-fauouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
   <p>If they accept it,<note place="margin">The Authors reason, why his booke is not to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked.</note> as reason requires they should,
despight of all malicious enuie, themselues shall
soone perceiue, that mine intent is good &amp; honest;
whence may ensue this conclusion, that this work
of mine, notwithstanding how earnestly soeuer it is
written on the Asses behalfe, deserues to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended:
either because (as I haue said) it is honest
and good, or for the desire I haue it should prooue
no otherwise. But what answere shall I make the
foolish, or to backbiting maligners: when (being
caught within their Griffen-like talents) they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to make an Anatomie of me?</p>
   <p>In sooth I know not what other answer I should
make to fooles,<note place="margin">How fooles and maligners are to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> then only not to regard them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(in reason) they cannot well blame another
bodies actions, till first they know how to rule and
manage their owne. To the maligners I say, that in
vsing me so hardly, it is the easier discerned how
they can detract, and speake of others as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
But if I light into the hands of wise &amp; good
men; I shall be assured, that they not knowing how
to speake euil, will neuer say of me otherwise then
well.</p>
   <p>Heereto I may likewise adde,<note place="margin">The differēce betweene fooles and wise men.</note> that if by lawe a
paine were appointed, that such as would not read
this Asse-maintaining treatise of mine, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be hindered from walking abroad, they might
<pb facs="4"/>
account it hard. But each one being at libertie to
reade or leaue it, they may likewise in reason spare
me this freedom, of giuing or withholding it from
the print.</p>
   <p>Then such as please to reade,<note place="margin">Read that wil, &amp; leaue that will.</note> let them reade, and
such as will not, let them leaue it. But this I may
well say to such as read it, and yet receiue not that
taste and Asse-delighting pleasure they expected,
that mens vnderstandings are diuers, and therefore
possibly it may be, that they differ farre from such,
who doubtlesse shall finde therein a sauour of some
sweetnesse. They that but beginning to read, finde
neither words or sence fitting their humour: they
may soone resolue on no further losse of time, but so
giue ouer, and proceed no further.</p>
   <p>Yet admit they go on, and read it out to the end,
the blame notwithstanding will bee theirs, who
made it after mine owne minde, and not to answere
theirs.<note place="margin">A reasonable admonition of the Author</note> Yea, their shame will be the greater, when
they shall detect the worke, that hath no sence but
what defendes the Asse. And more agreeing is it
with reason, that they should rather checke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
seeing without any taste of delight, they
were so simple to proceed in reading this Asses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,
a possession whereof they may (perhaps) find
in themselues, a long while after.</p>
   <p>Nor would I (learned Readers) that any of you
should enter into conceit, that I had so much of the
Asse in mee, as made mee bring to light this Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Asse, otherwise then to purge some
<pb facs="5"/>
short pleasure of this world.<note place="margin">The Authors censure of himselfe.</note> For I am assured, that
it will be thought a most foolish fopperie, a proud
folly, or rather the verie proudest foolerie in the
world: by reason the world hath bin so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares, without knowledge of the Asses No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
and happily it might haue continued so
still to the end, had not I vndertooke this Asse-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
labour: to make knowne the Asse in his
kind (as I haue said) to be the most Noble, not only
of the before named fiue sorts of fiue footed beasts,
but of other beside, that euer were produced by
our mother nature. Which I doubt not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
albeit I haue gathered into this currant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the properties, vertues, graces, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and naturall gifts, of those beasts whereof the
former fiue seuerall kindes haue made mention. To
the end, that they contending to be equall with the
Asse, it may generally appeare to them that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and truth wil be perswaded, the sentence ought
be pronounced on the Noble Asses behalfe.</p>
   <p>In whose company I leaue ye (most kind Asse-fauouring
Readers) offering my selfe readie &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to all your seruices.</p>
