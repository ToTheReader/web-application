   <head>Miles Coverdale, TO ALL CHRISTIAN Readers, wisheth grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, through our Lord and onely Saviour IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ike as the Almighty eternall God, three in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and one in substance, of his tender mercy and love, not only created man at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after his owne similitude and likenesse, but also when he was lost, most graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him, and brought him out of bond age: Even so when man (neither regarding his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull creation, nor his most deare redemption) gropeth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in vice and blindnesse, lieth in the Devils prison,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The accustomed good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God.</hi>
      </note> and goeth in the way of damnation; God alway setteth up his light before him, sendeth the message of his word unto him, sheweth him what case he is in, giveth him warning, openeth the prison doore, calleth him out of the Devils service, telleth him what danger it is to be his bondman, or servant unto sinne. This doth God alway afore he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and plague the world. This (I say) hath ever beene the worke of God since the beginning, as the stories and prophesies of all the holy Bible doe testifie. And though we had no writing of Gods acts in times past, yet hath he practised this same his wonderfull worke of mercy upon us. So that like as we must needs confesse,<note place="margin">
         <hi>God hath shewed no lesse kindnesse to us than he did to the old world.</hi>
      </note> that we are created of God, and redeemed by his only mercy in his deare Sonne Iesus Christ: So can we not denie, but we have heard his holy message, had no lesse preachings and warnings of dangers to come, than other have had afore our daies. Yea even the same mercifull God that sent <hi>Noe</hi> to preach righteousnesse unto the wicked world, and converted the Ninivites by his word in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> hath done even so with us in every condition. And some (thanks be unto him therefore) hath bee brought out of darknesse into his wonderfull light, and out of the devils service, into the kingdome of his deare Sonne.</p>
   <p>But alas and woe to this unthankfull world. For like as a great number that be in prison of Satan, will not come forth when they
<pb facs="4"/>
are called and the doore set open, but goe on still stumbling in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">
         <hi>They that follow Gods word are laughed to scorne.</hi>
      </note> when the lanterne of light is offered them: Even so if any play a wise mans part, and doe as he is warned by Gods word, hee shall have a sort of apish people, a number of dizerds and scornfull mockers, which (because the man will not dance in the devils mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys with them, nor keepe their company in the bondage of sinne and vice, neither runne with them unto like confusion (as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calleth it) laugh him to scorne, and bleare out their tongues at him, even like fooles and cockscombs of the world. And like as when a poore wretch commeth out of prison, he shall have moe to stand gasing and gaping upon him, than to doe him good, or to helpe him to his fees: Even so now that God of his mercy hath called us out of Satans prison, and from the schoole of false doctrine, my Lords foole with his companions standeth staring upon us, and mocketh us, because we sit not still with other prisoners. There go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a fellow of the new learning (saith one) there is one of these new-fangled Gospellers (saith another) that is one of the new bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (saith the third) he followeth the new faith, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The doctrine of Christ his faith is no new thing.</hi>
      </note>Wherefore, in consideration hereof I have here set forth this booke: partly because it sheweth the antiquitie and ancient age of our holy Christian faith, and partly to give occasion unto all such as have received it, not to be ashamed of it, nor to shrinke from it, for any opprobrious mockage or scornfull derision in this world. The Apostle saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.</note> that the preaching or word of Christs crosse, is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse to them that perish, and that the thing which appertaineth to the spirit of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.14.</note> is foolishnesse to a carnall minded man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by like as we may learne that it is no new thing to be mocked and stared upon for holding with the doctrine that maketh so much of Christ his death, and the true worshipping of God in the spirit: even so may we see (to the singular comfort of our conscience) that no man mocketh us for it,<note place="margin">
         <hi>None but reprobates deride the truth of Gods Gospell.</hi>
      </note> but such as perish and are carnally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and that for all their derision and scorning, it is yet the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. and belongeth to his holy spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and is not our owne doctrine,<note place="margin">
         <hi>To us which are saved, it is the power of God.</hi>
      </note> neither of any other mans making. This is now to us a comfort and consolation.</p>
   <p>But because the world is angry with us for our faith, and giveth us so euill report for teaching it, it shall be expedient for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what faith is, and what faith we meane, when we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. First, because we may not describe it after our owne judgement, we will rehearse the words of the Apostle, which writing to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>What faith is.</hi> Hebr. 11.1.</note> saith after this manner: Faith is a substance of things to be hoped for, an evidence or certaintie of things which doe not appeare. By the which definition, it is manifest, that when we set forth or teach this faith, we meane no vaine faith, no false opinion of faith, no fond imagination of faith, no dead faith, no
<pb facs="4"/>
idle faith; but a substantiall thing, even a sure beleefe of things that are to be hoped for, and a proofe, experience, or knowledge of things that are not seene. This faith then is the instrument, whereby we feele and are certaine of heavenly things, that our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eye cannot see. Now because none other vertue can so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the mercy of God, nor certifie us so effectually of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as this living faith doth, therefore hath the Scripture impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our justification before God, only unto faith among all other vertues: not without other vertues following, but without any other worke or deed justifying. This is the faith of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28. Gal. 2.16. Ephes. 2.8. Phil. 3.9. Iaco. 2.14.</note> which all the Scripture speaketh of. This is the faith that <hi>S. Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to justifie in the sight of God: as <hi>S. Iames</hi> teacheth, that works justifie in the sight of men, and that it is but a dead faith which hath no works. This is the faith, without the which it is impossible to please God, and of the which whatsoever proceedeth not, is sinne. This is the faith whereby God purifieth our hearts,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6. Rom. 14.23. Act. 15.9. 1 Pet. 1.9. Gala. 5.6. 1 Cor. 10.3. Heb. 11.4.</note> and whose end is salvation. This is the faith that worketh by charitie or godly love, &amp; is of value before God. This is the faith whereby the holy fathers which were afore Christs incarnation did in spirit eat and drinke &amp; enjoy the same mercy of God in Christ, that we are partakers of. To be short, this is the same faith, whereby God saved those his elect, of whÅ <hi>S. Paul</hi> maketh mention in the foresaid epistle to the Hebrewes, and rehearseth many godly fruits of the same in their conversation.</p>
   <p>This then is no new-fangled faith, no strange faith, no faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by mans braine, but even the same that Gods holy spirit teacheth in the infallible truth of his Scripture, and that <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch,</hi> and all the other servants of God were saved in. Why doe men therefore either call it a new-fangled faith, or report evill of us, for setting it forth? Why? I feare me this is one cause: The old faith that all those servants of God had, whom the Apostle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the eleventh to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.4, 5.</note> had a life and conversation joyned unto it, which was rich and full of all good works. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing there be so many bablers and pratlers of faith, and so few that bring forth the worthy fruits of repentance, it giveth the world occasion to report of us, that our faith is but new-fangled. They see us not fall to labour and taking of paines, as <hi>Adam</hi> did: They see not the righteousnesse and thankfulnesse in us, that was in <hi>Abel:</hi> They see us not walke after the word and will of God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did: They see us not take Gods warning so earnestly as <hi>Noe</hi> did: They see us not so obedient to the voice of God, nor so well willing and content to leave our friends, to forsake our owne wils, our owne lands and goods at Gods calling, and dwell in a strange country, to doe Gods pleasure, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: they see that wee chuse not rather to suffer adversitie with the people of God, than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season: They see us not esteeme
<pb facs="5"/>
the rebuke of Christ, or trouble for his sake, to be greater riches than all the treasures of this world, as <hi>Moses</hi> did: To be short, they see not in our garden those sweet flowers and fruits of Gods holy Spirit, which were in them that had the old faith.</p>
   <p>Ashamed may wee be therefore, as many of us as either write, teach, preach, speake or talke of the old faith, if wee endevour not our selves to have those old heavenly vertues that were ever plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all Gods true servants, in every one (I meane) according to his calling. Not that it is evill, to teach or talke of the true old faith, but this I say,<note place="margin">Iames 1âª21</note> because that (according to the doctrine of <hi>S. Iames</hi>) they are but deceivers of themselves, that are not doers of Gods word, as well as hearers thereof. And through such slender recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christs holy Gospell, it is now come to passe, that like as we haue need of such an Apostle as was holy <hi>S. Paul,</hi> to rebuke this vaine confidence that men put in their workes, and to tell us that no worke of our doing (but faith of Gods working, doth justifie us in his sight. Even so have wee no lesse need of such another Apostle (as was holy <hi>S.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Would to God we had many such as</hi> Iames <hi>the Apostle was.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Iames</hi>) to rebuke this horrible unthankfulnesse of men, that professing themselves to bee Christians, and to hold of Christs old faith, are yet dead unto all good workes, receive not the word of God in meekenesse, cast not away all uncleannesse and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiousnesse, are swift to speake, to talke, to jangle, and to take dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; are forgetfull hearers of the Word, and not livers thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, boasting themselves to be of Gods pure and undefiled Religion, and yet refraine nor their tongues from evill, visit not the poore, the friendlesse, and the desolate in their trouble, neither keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves undefiled from this world. Reade the first chapter of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.<note place="margin">Iames 1.</note>
   </p>
   <p>What an occasion might such an Apostle (as holy <hi>Iames</hi> was) have, to write another, yea a sharper Epistle, seeing so many pretending to be of Iesus Christs old faith, are yet so partiall, have such a carnall respect of persons, are not rich in faith, despise the poore, practise not the law of godly love, talke and jangle of faith, not having the workes thereof,<note place="margin">
         <hi>O unthankefull world.</hi>
      </note> clothe not the naked, helpe not the poore to their living, regard not their necessitie, have but a dead faith, declare not by good and godly workes, the true and old faith of Christ, are but vaine beleevers, have not the eflectuous, the working and living faith,<note place="margin">Iames 2.25.</note> that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> had. Reade the second chapter of his Epistle.</p>
   <p>How would holy <hi>Iames</hi> reprove these bringers up of strange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Saint</hi> Iames <hi>would not spare to rebuke such.</hi>
      </note> blasphemers, backbiters, belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s of good men, false teachers against Gods truth, dissemblers with the same, cary fire (as they say) with the one hand, and water in the other: pretend to be learned, and yet bring not forth the workes of good conversation in meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of Gods wisdome, but in frowardnesse, and out of carnall
<pb facs="5"/>
doctrine. How would he take up these, that delight in malice and strife, belie Gods truth, are given to earthly, fleshly, and devillish wisdome, are unstable, full of all evill workes, are not in the schoole of Gods wisdome and learning, are not given to unfainednesse of heart, are not peaceable, are churlish, uneasie to be intreated, &amp;c. Reade the third chapter of his Epistle.<note place="margin">Iames 3 17.</note>
   </p>
   <p>What would such an holy Apostle say to this wicked world,<note place="margin">Iames 4.1.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a great number (pretending to be Christian men) are given so to quarelling and fighting, to voluptuousnesse and inordinate lusts,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Against such grosse vices would not Saint</hi> Iames <hi>spare to speake.</hi>
      </note> to envie and indignation, to unlawfull spending and consuming of that they may get, to advoutrie, to the despising of holy wedlocke, to shamefull uncleannesse, either not willing to marry, or else putting away their wives for light occasions, and for satisfying of their owne trifling lusts, falling in love with the vaine friendship of this world, taking part against God: yea whereas by their profession, oath, and allegiance (which they owe to their most high Soveraigne the King of heaven) they should in a vertuous conversation maintaine all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, are become even enemies, suppressours and overthrowers thereof, as well through their obstinate and cruell resisting of Gods word, as by other wicked examples of their vicious and filthy living? What would holy <hi>S. Iames</hi> say to such unthankfull bellies, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, live after such a sort? Would he spare them though they were never so rich and wealthie? Reade the fourth chapter of his Epistle, and the first part of his fifth chapter,<note place="margin">Iames 4.</note> and yee will judge the contrarie.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, most deare Readers, whosoever of you hath beene slacke to follow the good life and godly conversation that <hi>S. Iames,</hi> and all the other Scripture beside requireth to be in them, which professe the old faith, let them take better hold, turne againe to the truth, and follow that loving exhortation, which holy <hi>S.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iames 5.19.</note>
      <hi>Iames</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the latter end of his Epistle. And if he hath at the first not enclined to Gods word, nor received it unfainedly in meekenesse,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Let every man take the paines to rebuke his owne fault.</hi>
      </note>
nor submitted himselfe to be ordered thereby, and to cast away all uncleannesse, &amp;c. But hath haply suffered it, promoted it, set it forth, or taken a pretence of favour and love to it, for some other purpose to obtaine any carnall profit, gaines or libertie by it; let him not put holy <hi>S. Iames,</hi> or any other true messenger of God, to the paines of rebuking him for so doing: let him rather enter into himselfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his owne fault and abuse in that behalfe, abhorre it in any wise, be angry, displeased and discontent with himselfe, sorie and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for it, shame not to aske God mercie, and by good workes from hence forward to labour, that the glory of God, and worship of his truth, may be preferred and set up, which he by such his unchristian living, hath in times past caused to be hindred.</p>
   <p>In conclusion: Though there be never so many that recant and
<pb facs="6"/>
deny Gods holy word, either in their living and conversation, or in their words, writing or preaching, yet as many of us as are entered into the schoole of that wisdome which is from aboue, let us be true scholers of the same, and practise it both in our thought, word and deed: let us even enter into the nature and kinde thereof: which (as <hi>S.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iames 3.17. <hi>We must put on the nature of Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.) is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easie to be intreated, full of mercie and good fruits, without judging and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. Which thing if we doe, then shall we follow no filthy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor counterfeited wisdome, then shall we be no breakers of peace, then shall we be as glad to forgive, as we would be forgiven, glad to be reformed, rich and plentifull in the workes of mercie and good fruits of the old faith: then shall we be no quarrell-pickers or dissemblers with any man: Then shall wee not only be found the maintainers of peace and all good order, but peaceably also, and in all gentle manner shall we (both in word and deed) sow, spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and shew the fruit of that righteousnesse, which commeth only of God through Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>If any of them that are gone (of high or low estate, pretending to be maintainers, favourers, setters forth, or scholers of Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) hath in any condition dissembled therewith, fallen from God, misbehaved himselfe in the affaires of his Prince, misgoverned his houshold, maintained riot, vice and sinne, or brought the good word of God into any evill report by his ungodly conversation (as I feare me, it be too true) let us beware by such mens fall. Let us not receive the grace of God in vaine. For like as they that harden their hearts at Gods word, and spurne wilfully against it, are sure of their damnation,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Let the workes of God, which are past, be a warning to us.</hi>
      </note> except they repent; Even so they that dissemble withall, shall finde their judgement. Wherefore let us that have received the old true faith of Christ, not only be content to abide any storme or trouble for it (yea to be mocked, scorned, persecuted, and put to death therefore, if it so please God) but also unfainedly every man to his power, in his heart by fervent prayer, in his mouth by good words, and in all his bodie by vertuous conversation and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian workes, helpe and labour, that the blessed word of God may have the due honour belonging thereunto, and that the same which it hath lost through ungodly behaviour of some, may through the grace and goodnesse of God bee wonne againe in our good living: That God may have of us better servants, our Prince truer subjects, and our neighbours more unfained lovers, than many have been before us. <hi>Amen.</hi>
