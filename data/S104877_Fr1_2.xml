The cause why I sett my name before this litle treatyse ād ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve not rather done it in the new testament is that then I folowed the cownself of Christ w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich exhorteth men Matth. vj. to doo theyr good deades secretly ād to be contēt with the cōscience of well doynge / and that God seeth vs / and paciently to abyde the rewarde of the last daye which Christ hath purchased for vs ād now wold fayne have done lyke wyse / but am compelled other wise to doo.</p>
   <p>While I abode a faythfull cōpanyon w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich now hath takē a nother vyage apō him / to preach Christ where (I suppose) he was ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver yet preached (God which putt in his her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te thither to goo sende his sprite with him / cō forte him and bringe his purpose to good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte) one Williā Roye a man somewhat craf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye when he cometh vnto new accoyntaunce and before he be thorow knowen and namely whē all is spēt / came vnto me ād offered his helpe. As longe as he had no money / som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I could ruele hī. but as sone as he had goten him money / he became lyke him selfe

agayne. Neverthelesse I suffered all thinges fill y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> was ēded which I coulde nor doo alone without one both to write &amp; to helpeme to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> textes together. Whē that was ended I toke my leve ād bode him farewell for oure two lyves / ād as mē saye a daye lōger. After we were departed he went / and gate hym new frēdes which thinge to doo he passeth all that ever I yet knewe. And there when he had stored him of money he gote him to Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine where he professeth wonderfull faculties and maketh bost of no small thinges. A yere after that and now .xij. monethes before the printinge of this worke / came one Ierō a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Grenewich also / thorow wormes to Argētine / saienge that he entended to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes disciple a nother while ād to kepe (as nye as God wolde geve him grace) the profession of his baptim / and to gett his lyvinge with his handes / and to live no lenger ydely and of the swete ād laboure of those captives which they had taught / not to beleve in Christ: but in cutt showes and russet coetes. Which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom wyth all diligence I warned of Royes boldnesse ād exhorted him to bewarre of him and to walke quyetly and with all pacience and longe sofferinge acordinge as we have Christe &amp; his Apostles for an ēsample / which thinge he also promised me. Neverthelesse
<pb facs="3"/>
when he was comen to Argentine william Roye (whos tōge is able not only to make fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les sterke madde / but also to disceave the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that is at the fyrst sight ād accoyntaunce) gate him to him and sert him a werke to make times / while he him selfe translated a dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge out of laten in to englisch / in whose prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge he promyseth moare a greate deall than I fere me he will ever paye. Paul saith the secō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de pystell to Thimothe the seconde Chapitter▪ the servant of the lord must not stryve / but be peaceable vnto all men and ready to teach / &amp; one that can suffer the evel with mekenesse / and that can enforme them that resiste. Iff god at any time will geve them repentaunce for to know the throuth. It becometh not th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the lordes servante to vse raylinge rymes / but Gods wordes which is the right wepon to slaye sinne / vice and all iniquite. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is good to teach and to improve. ij. Thim. iij. and .ij. Thes. ij. Paul speakinge of Antichriste saieth / whom the lorde shall destroye with the sprite or breth of his mouth that is / with the worde of God. And .ij. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians .x. The wepons of oure warre are not Carnall thinges (sayth he) but mightye in God to cast downe stronge holdes and so fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rth / that is / to destroye hye byldinges of false doctrine. The worde of God is y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> daie wher of

Paul speaketh .j. Corint. iij.) which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all thinge / ād that fyre which shall trye every mans werke and consume false doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: with that swerde ought mē sharply to fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght / and not to rayle with folishe rymes. Let it not offende the that some walke inordinatly let not the wickednes of Iudas cause the to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spice the doctrine of his fellows. No man ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to thinke that Steven was a fals prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher be cause that Nicolas which was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen felowe with him (Act. vj.) to ministre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the widowes fell after ī to great heresies as historyes make mencion. Good and evell goo alwayes to geder / one can not be knowē with out the other. Marke this also above althin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that Antichrist is not an outwarde thīge that is to saye aman that shuld sodenli appere with wonders as our fathers talked of him. No verily for Antichriste is a spirituall thīge And is as moch to say as agaynft Christ / th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at is one that preaches false doctrine cōtrarye to Christ. Antichrist was in the old Testamē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and fought with the Prophets / he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the ryme of Christ and of the Apostles as thou readist in the Pistles of John ād of Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le to the Corinthiās and Galathians / and ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her Pistles. Antichrist is now ād shall (I dout not) endure till the worldes ende. But his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is (when he is vttered ād overcome with
<pb facs="4"/>
the worde of god) to go out of the Playe for a season and to disgyse him selfe and then to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in agayne with a new name and new ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ymente. As thou seist how Christ rebuketh the scribes and the Pharises in the Gospell (which were very Antichristes) sayīge wo be to you pharises for ye robbe widowes houses ye praye lōge prayers ūder a coloure / ye sheet vp the kīgdome of hevē and sofre not thē that woold to enter in / ye have take awaye the fay of knowleage / ye make mē breake gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes with your tradicions / ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle the people with ypocresy and such lyke. Which thīges all oure prelates doo: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve yet gotē them newe names and other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes / and are other wise disgised / Ther is differēce in the names betwene a pope / a Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall / a Bisshope / and so forth / and to say a scribe / a pharisey / a seniour and so forth: but the thinge is all one. Even so now when we have vttered hym / he will chāge hym selfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes moare ād turne hym selfe in to an angell of light .ij. Corinth. xi. Reade the place I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte the / what so ever thou art that readest this ād note it well. The Jewes loke for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste ād he ys come fyftyne hundred yeres a goo and they not ware: we also have loked for An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tychriste ond he hath regned as longe and we not ware: and that because eyther of vs loked

The Jewes had fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde Christ verely if they had sought hī in the lawe and the prophetes / whither Christe sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thē to seke. Jhohn .v.
