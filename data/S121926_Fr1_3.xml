   <p>I haue often beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, that men of so great worth in the eyes of the world (GOD hauing set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them this vniuersall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the saluation and reparation of mankinde through the preaching of the Gospell) could yet still delight and dally in these errors the abhomination whereof hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beene declared vnto them. And it is strange that this impietie which durst onely whisper in the eare, doth now steppe vp into the Pulpit and there practiseth, that shee may spew forth her blasphemies against the holy Religion of
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> Which not onely our Iesuites doe labour apace to set forward and aduance, but also our Apostates, who thinking to shew that by good reasons they haue beene moued to reuolt, haue so much the more manifested their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or rather foolishnesse, euen in such a time as the veritie is made so cleare, and falshood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked with so great aduantage. Wherein wee may acknowledge the profound iudgements of God, who neuer hauing fayled to such as sought after his glorie, and hauing at this day manifested him-selfe in his word as much as euer hee did, to the end that hee might make knowne vnto vs the foundation stone of his admirable building of the Church, to wit his sonne <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greater part of such, as goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cloath themselues with this so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Title of Christian, not beeing content with this spirituall seede of the regeneration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde hath inuented I know not what word, which they name vnwritten, and in stead of Chusing the true Sion, are well pleased to dwell among those olde ruines of Gentilisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue beautified the mayne part of their seruice. And verily, if wee consider narrowlie this great heape of their ceremonies, and that which they holde to bee the principall hindge of Religion, wee shall perceiue that they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the gouernement of their Church (which ought rather to haue beene the holy habitation of God) vnto. <hi>Numa Pompilius, Pontife</hi> of Rome, or to some olde Law-giuers, which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb facs="6"/>
certaine Lawes, concerning such things as they reputed sacred, and thought to belong vnto the seruice of their Gods. Behold then the Heathen returned into the world, and that after a triumphing manner, who to the end that they might the better fortifie themselues against <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> haue called great <hi>Caiphas</hi> and the Scribes to assist them, that they may depriue him of his spirituall kingdome: Pharisaisme, that they may restore againe the false doctrine of good workes: and the Marcionists, that of his humanirie they may make onely a fansie. What further? In a word behold Gentilisme, Iudaisme and old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies erected in the sanctuary, where the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory ought to haue beene alone to attend and learne the Oracles of one onely God. But to the end that those against whom wee proceede, may haue no cause to complaine, as if wee had accused them vniustly, I haue vndertaken to declare (though briefly) in these three conformities, how that the Romish Church is very much putrified and corrupted, and that shee is full of diseases. And hauing had no other desseing at the begining of this worke, but for mine owne particular vse, hauing already dedicated my writes vnto a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my closet, yet notwithstanding the aduise of my friends hath made me steppe on a little far ther, and publish the same. And I am so much delighted in the beautie of this subiect, that I haue taken the boldnesse to consecrate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the first Conformitie vnto you: first as an homage for so many good deedes for which I
<pb facs="7"/>
remaine your debtour: Next because I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies knowne your zeale toward Gods word, whereof not onely your learned writs doe beare record, but also your publick lectures in Diuinity, and other holy exercises of pietie, whereby you are admired and beloued of good people. And truely it is reason that the fruits of my labours should bee yours, seeing the ground is yours: Take therefore in good part this little essay, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by him who is</p>
