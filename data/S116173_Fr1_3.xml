   <head>To the gentle Reader, in the commendation of Fables.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I reuolued in my minde the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kindes of vvriters, vvhich for the profit of mā haue put in remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance their imaginations, they that haue vvrit Fables are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vvith the reste: for they haue not onely vvonderfully delighted the harts of men, but also haue more allured them to doe thinges both good and profitable vvith their Fables, than Philosophers vvith their preceptes. For they vvith suche a svveet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse do so pierce the hartes of the Readers, and by similitudes do declare (vvhich are of muche force to moue affection) vvhat mē ought to take, and vvhat to refuse, that thereby they are compelled, against their vvils to agree vnto them. For the minde is disdaynfull to heare, neyther vvill it easely abyde things profitable and honest, excepte they be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vvith some merry ieste. Hereunto beareth vvitnesse a certein Orator of <hi>Athens,</hi> vvho on a tyme speaking to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> vvhen he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued them lesse attentiue, required them that they vvoulde vouchsafe to heare a Fable: they vvere contented: then he began thus: Ceres, the Svvallovve and the Egle sometyme iorneyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, vvhen they vvere come to a riuer, the
<pb facs="3"/>
Svvallovve flue ouer, and the Eele svvam through the ryuer: vvhen he had so saide he helde his peace: then they asked him vvhat Ceres did? Your Gods (quod he) are offended at you vvhich vvil not hear them that counsell you for your profit, but if they tell any tales yee heare them vvillingly. VVhat force fables are of to moue affection, I coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by many examples, yet vvill I propound but three. The inhabitants of <hi>Samos</hi> vvould haue put their ruler to death, vvhome <hi>Aesope</hi> dissuaded, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: As a Fox passed ouer a riuer he vvas driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ditche vvhere he stucke fast in the mudde, that he could not escape, vvhome the Flies stinged, the hedgehog seing him ther, moued vvith compassiō, asked him if he shoulde driue the Flies from him. No (quod he) for these are full vvith my bloud and can litle trouble me, but if thou shouldest driue thē avvay, other hunger sterued flies vvil occupie their romes, and suck out al the bloud that is lefte vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. The like shall happen to you O <hi>Samians,</hi> for if ye slay your Ruler vvhich is so vvealthie, ye must needs chose others, vvhich vvhiles they enriche thē selues, shall poll you of all that this man hath lefte: vvherevvithall the <hi>Samians</hi> being moued, lefte off their purpose. By the like meanes vvas <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> persuaded, vvhen he appointed for euery day Magistrates, vvherevppon (as <hi>Josephus</hi> telleth) the countrie of <hi>Jurie</hi> vvas gouerned by <hi>Cratus</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus</hi> onely by the space of tvventie yeares. For
<pb facs="3"/>
(as <hi>Statius</hi> sayth) hee that ruleth but a litle vvhile, shevveth small fauour to the people. The <hi>Himeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> sometime minded to choose Captaine of their armie, <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> vvhom <hi>Stesichorus</hi> the Poet vvith this Fable discouraged from their purpose, saying. A horse fed alone in a medovve, at length came a Harte thither and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it: vvhervpon the horse toke the aduise of man, by vvhat meane he might be reuenged, to vvhome the man sayde: If thou vvilt take a bit in thy mouth and suffer me armed to get vpon thy backe, vvhose counsel he follovved, and by his helpe put the harte to flight and became the conquerer, but from that time forth he could not rid his mouth from the bit nor the mā from his backe. Euen so (sayde <hi>Stesicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) the like shall happen to you, if ye chose <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> your captaine, for your enimies ye shall subdue but ye shal be in bondage to this Tyraunt for euer: vvith vvhich vvordes the <hi>Himerians</hi> being discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, forsoke the counsel to chose such a captaine. VVhat time the people of <hi>Rome</hi> separated them selues from the Senators, bicause they payd tribute and vvere combred vvith vvarfares, did not <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Minenius</hi> turne them from their purpose vvith this fable? Sometime (quoth he) ye <hi>Romaines,</hi> the members of man perceiuing the belly to be slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, fell at variance vvith hir &amp; determined to giue her no longer any succor. It happened, that bicause they denied her nourishment, they became faynt,
<pb facs="4"/>
vvhervpon they vver at one again. In like maner the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> are as the belly and members, vvhich neede one of anothers helpe, and as by discord they perishe, so by concord they are of strength: By vvhich tale the people turned from their purpose and became friends againe vvith the Senate. Therfore not vvithout good cause both the Greeke and Latin Poets, as <hi>Hesiodus</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> haue mingled suche Fables amongst their vvorkes, and also the chiefest and famous Philosophers, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plutarche,</hi> vvith many moe, haue highly commended them, vvhose opiniō vvas, that they much auayled to the instruction of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ciuill life: vvherfore <hi>Leouicenus</hi> and <hi>Ʋalla,</hi> of late vvriters the best learned, did translate Fables out of Greke into Latin, vvhich they knevv vvould be to their praise, and to the delight and profite of others: Neither vvere they deceyued, for they are daily red of most learned mē. I cā not therfore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, vvhy by translating these Fables, I should be defrauded of the prayse due to me, vvhich other haue had, except vve bee so spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that to vs that is not lavvfull, vvhich vvith great cōmendatiō to the Grecians and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes is allovved. Farevvell.</p>
