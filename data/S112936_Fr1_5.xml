   <head>The Arguments of these treatises.</head>
   <div n="1" type="treatise">
      <p>THE former treatise declareth the state of the kingdome of <hi>Israell,</hi> the which we haue endeuoured to learne and set downe in plaine manner out of the scripture, wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth, especially out of the bookes of <hi>Samuell,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>Chronicles,</hi> wherein the first originall, continuance and end, yea the whole n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ture and condition of this gouernment is at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Where by the kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> we doe not meane that apostaticall, rebellious and idolatrous kingdome of the ten tribes vsually called the kingdome of <hi>Israell,</hi> or the kingdome of <hi>Samaria,</hi> but the kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi>: the which we call by the first, ancient, and right name of <hi>Israell</hi> because our purpose is to entreate of the state of it, as it was at the first instituted by <hi>Samuell,</hi> and as it continued vnder <hi>Saule, Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in whose time it was called the kingdome of <hi>Israell.</hi> But in the beginning of the raigne of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>boam</hi> it lost ten of the tribes, and together the right name which vsually followeth the greater part. For the which cause in the time following it was called the kingdome of <hi>Iuda,</hi> for that the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> did not onely make the greatest part of it, but also had the prerogatiue of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome annexed vnto it. The causes by the which we are moued to thinke the state of this kingdome most worthy to be carefully sought out and truely knowen, are these: because of all the kingdomes in the world, this onely was instituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or at the least approued by him, and also registred and fully described in the bookes of the scripture, yea and first practised in the Church of God. In the which respectes we cannot doubt, but that the true and perfect knowledge of it doth greately belong to the Church and to all the members of it. And yet we doe not speake of it, as of the onely lawfull forme of gouernement and that which ought to be vsed of the Church in all places. For there is no kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which may not lawfully bee established among Christians, and as lawfully vsed amongest them as this. Neyther as if all kingdomes shoulde be squared according
<pb facs="8"/>
to this rule: from the which they may farre differ without any blame: for the iudiciall lawes of the commonwealth or of the kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> doe not belong to the Church. Neyther yet doe we affirme this kingdome to be the most excellent and conuenient state, and that which christians according to the example of this people shoulde earnestly desire and seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: wishing rather that euerie one be content with that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which is already established in the place where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, not thinking of any alteration which is verie dangerous and bringeth with it, as alwaies great troubles, so often a finall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the people. But we leaue it to them who professe know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge and experience in these matters to determine what kinde of gouernment is eyther most excellent in the owne nature and in contemplation, or most conuenient to be put in practise. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we purpose to make a bare and historical narration of the state of this kingdome, the which we trust is not vnprofitable but will serue for the good of the reader in diuers respectes especially in those which haue bene already mentioned.</p>
