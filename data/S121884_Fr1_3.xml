   <head>TO THE READER.
Concerninge the causes of the
nevv Edition of this Relation;
vvith a defence therof against
diuers Impugners.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HREE</hi> or foure causes (good
reader) haue induced me to
renew this <hi>Relation,</hi> and to
sett yt forth againe, after three years
space, that it was first wrytten, and
printed, which was in the yeare of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biley
1600. The first reason is, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
hauing to performe afterward in this
third part of the Treatise, <hi>of three
Conuersions of England,</hi> diuers
points heere promised concerninge the
vnfolding of sundry falsifications, vsed
as well by <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> as by some other
English wryters of our time; I thought
good to lay downe the ground of my
obligation and promise made in this
relation, to the end yt may be seene,
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
whether I do satisfie the same or no.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, wheras my former narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was very breefe, &amp; founded only
vpo certaine letters receaued from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
at that time; now I hauing pervsed
the whole acts &amp; gests of that coferēce,
betweene the B. of <hi>Eureux, &amp; Plessis
Morney,</hi> authentically published by
authority, &amp; by the approbatio of the
deputies themselues that were iudges in
the cause; I haue come to know many
particulars which then I knew not, &amp;
consequently, I am desirous, that the
reader should be partaker therof in like
manner for that they may import him
not a little, being of the subiect they are.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> My third reason was, for that there
hath come to my hands since the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
printinge of this <hi>Relation</hi> two
aduersary wrytings, published against
the same, or at least wise, against some
principall points therof, the one in
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
French, wrytten (as is thought) by
the <hi>L. Plessis</hi> himselfe or by some other
at his directio, after the flight from the
combat, the other in English by <hi>O. E.</hi>
otherwise interpreted <hi>Mathevv Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe.</hi>
who hath taken vpon him to be
his procter and aduocate: both vvhich
wrytings I thought good in this place,
breefely to looke ouer, &amp; by occasion of
printing againe this <hi>Relation,</hi> to lett
the reader see, what truth or substance
there is in them; but yet with such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of speach as we may imitate
therin (so neere as may be) the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
proceeding vsed by the aduersary
partyes in this <hi>Triall</hi> in France, as a
little after you shall heere, &amp; in deed is
conuenient to the subiect handled,
(which is Religion) and to the persons
that treate the same.</p>
   <p>And albeit accordinge to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
which men giue heere of the
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
nature &amp; condition of <hi>O. E.</hi> little hope
is conceaued of any good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from him in this point, as not so
powerable ouer his owne passions, as to
performe it: yet will I hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
for this tyme, presuminge that
his so exorbitant excesse in former
wrytings, proceeding of the confidence
of a visard, wherby he thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to passe vnknowen; but now the
maske being taken away, and euery
child being able to read and interprett
vvhat the vvords <hi>O. E.</hi> do signifie, to
witt, a person, that professeth Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
life &amp; dignity; I shall expect
somwhat from him agreeable to that
profession, vvherin I promise againe
all due correspondence on my behalfe,
to the end, that matters of Religion
may be handled in the stile they ought
to be. But if I be deceaued, and that
he vvill needs follow his ould veigne
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
still; I am like inough to leaue him in
that kind and giue him ouer to others;
that vvill pay him perhaps his dew,
according to that of the ghospell,<note place="margin">Matt. 18</note>
      <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur
tortoribus, quousque perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerit
vltimum quadrantem,</hi> for
there vvant neyther men, nor matter
to performe yt. And so much of this.</p>
   <p>For these reasons then, and some
other, I haue byn moued to sett forth
this <hi>Relation</hi> againe, togeather with
a defence therof, encreased, as yow
vvill see, and confirmed out of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
acts sett forth by publike
authority. I do thinke the reading, &amp;
pervsing heerof, vvill turne thee (good
Reader) to singular commodity, if it
be done vvith indifferency and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To Gods euerlasting glory be all
referred, vvhole euer preserue thee.
This first of <hi>December 1603.</hi>
