   <head>TO THE RIGHT
Worshipfull, Sir DAVID
MVRREY, Knight, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Gentleman of the
Prince his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is (right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
condition of
all Christians,
howsoeuer disioyned in place,
that they are militant in
one warfare against Sathan
with his Principalities, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and spirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whose stratagems are
<pb facs="3"/>
innumerable, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his assaults manifold:
he troubleth not all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
one manner of way; for
so euery one might easily espie
wherein his strength lyeth,
but makes choise of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as by long experience
he hath learned it may bee
most effectuall to worke vpon
our naturall disposition. Like
as on the other hand, the
Grace by which God streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth
his Children to resist
him, is much more manifold;
whereby they are instructed
to vse the Armour of God,
with such variety of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisedome, that is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see, how by one and
<pb facs="3"/>
the selfesame sentēce of Gods
word, at sundry hands, sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
manner of wayes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
is confounded: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very needfull that
in the spirituall warfare
there should be a mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
among the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Christ, as well for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering
of Sathans seuerall
sleights in assaulting; for the
more his policie is detected,
the better may we eschew it;
as also, for the manifestation
of GODS rich mercy in
assisting.</p>
   <p>For this cause haue I been
induced to communicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, these Meditations,
as it pleased God by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="4"/>
to communicate them
vnto me, for in the middest
of darknesse which couered
the mind, and restlesse feare
which disquieted the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the Lord made them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
to breake out, like
sparkles of light, sent from
his owne Throne of Grace,
bringing with them light,
peace, and ioy, which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remoued the former
feares, and pacified the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations
of my troubled
soule. As they were vnto me,
so I wish they may be meanes
of comfort vnto others: but
I know that the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of comfort, which hath
comforted one in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="4"/>
doth not alwaies comfort
another: Nay, not in the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
temptation; for the
Lord will haue his praise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to himselfe, that hee
onely is the God of al comfort.
It is not the word, (saith
<hi>Dauid</hi>) but God by the word
that did quicken him, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 9. Yea, the most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
promise of the Gospell is
most terrible to the troubled
conscience, except the Lord
by it worke in the heart a
sence of his mercy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such as want comfort,
let thē seeke it from the God
of comfort. Neuerthelesse,
that which we haue, we giue
euen as we haue receiued it;
<pb facs="5"/>
that it may stand as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
of my thankfulnes to
God who shewed his great
mercy vpon me, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my selfe I had receiued the
sentence of death; and a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of my loue toward
them who are militant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sathan: And specially
of that Christian remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
I haue alway of you
in the Lord Iesus; to whose
grace I commend you, now,
and for euer.</p>
