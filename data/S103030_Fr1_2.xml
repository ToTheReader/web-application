   <p>GOOD Madam, these ensuing lines (such as they are) when they were first framed (which is now above twelve moneths since) were at that time no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, than that place and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where they were then preached: but in regard it hath pleased Almighty God, since that time, to give diverse occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for the further pressing of

this duty of hospitality to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and especially the other day,<note place="margin">

      </note> when no lesse than sixteene or seventeen saile of Ships were at one time cast away upon our Coast, to the great losse of many mens goods and lives; and that our people for the most part (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the meaner sort) for ought I yet perceive, continue still in their wonted course of barbarisme towards the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">

Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have boldly adventured to make that publike to the view of many, which was first utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in the hearing but of few;
