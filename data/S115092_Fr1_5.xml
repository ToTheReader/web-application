      <hi>We know that God hath spoken to Moses, but this man we know not whence he is.</hi> To whom preposterously boasting of their antiquitie, we may easily answer with the words of Christ himselfe, <hi>From the beginning it was not so, Had ye beleeued Moses, or his writings, yee had likewise beleeued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> me.</hi> Had yee beleeued the sacred word of God, the holie Scriptures inspired from aboue, the true antiquitie, the onely treasurie of the Charters of the Christian Church, ye had likewise beleeued me. But truely if yee be not ouer hard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, I doubt not but in this worke I shall satisfie you touching both these scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Let them not make you beleeue the Popes haue bin alwaies such as you now adore. Behold here their beginning, their progression, their encrease, their secret, subtile, cruell, outragious enterprises, violences, assaults. A Mysterie (not without mysterie so called) vnder pretence of the ministerie, ending in this prodigious estate that we see in this two-headed monster; whilest the ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, the Prelats, Bishops, Archbishops, Patriarches, partly vnder Heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> endured cruell persecutions, partly vnder Christians, though greatly enriched by them, whom they obeyed willingly, and in all humilitie at the first, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their desires encreasing with their meanes, more carelesly, and rather for a fashion than otherwise; shortly after by open ambition, and flattering some in their sinnes, especially <hi>Phocas</hi> in his murder, they were made Vniuersall Bishops, and secular Princes in Italie, excluding Emperours; and not content to withdraw themselues from their obedience, they likewise absolued both the nobles and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of that oath of allegiance wherewith they were bound. At the last, threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with both swords, they mingled prophane things with holie, confounding
<pb facs="5"/>
and deuouring the holie in the prophane. They set kings together by the eares,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that so they might ruin at one the other, and they by their ruine and ouerthrow rise to the highest step of their power. They crowne Emperours, make and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make them at their pleasure, trampling them vnder their feet. They are now Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Popes together, the Lords and Monarches of the world, now higher than the Angels, equall with God himselfe, nay gods, great and omnipotent, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating and abrogating the commandements of the highest God, creating God himselfe at their pleasure, nay causing him to be created by those whom they call their creatures. Now let him whosoeuer he be that yet doubteth, couple &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare these two extreames together, A minister of God, sometime a Prelat of the Church, now made a god, sitting in his throne, vsing God (if we may beleeue it)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as his officer: Sometime humble and gentle, yea the seruant of seruants, yeelding obedience to all Princes whatsoeuer, now proud, cruell, treading vpon the neckes of the greatest powers, the greatest Princes: Sometime glorious for the sanctitie of his life, suffering ioyfully for the name of Christ all torments and tortures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, now prophane, puffed vp with a vaine title of holinesse, embrued &amp; made drunken with the bloud of Saints. What reason, what proportion can there be, I pray you, betwixt two extreames so different, so repugnant? And what should stay vs but that with astonishment we may crie out, <hi>A Mysterie, great Babylon?</hi> In so strange a noueltie, so diuers changes, is it possible that any man should obiect the antiquitie of the Popedome; where Satan raigneth so visibly vnder the onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> name (to say no more) the maske of S. <hi>Peter?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let them not abuse you with the name of the Church, the <hi>Catholike</hi> they call it, thereby inferring the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> For the Church of Rome is not, nor euer was, the Vniuersall, the Catholike Church; a part thereof it was, so long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued pure and vnpolluted: but yet but a part with others, not aboue others. And therefore by her fall, her ruine, the flock of Christ cannot perish, though that perish vtterly; by her defection the flocke of Christ cannot fayle, though that faile vtterly. True it is, that the Church of Rome was once pure and chast, and no small part of the Spouse of Christ, so long as she hearkened to his voyce, and stopped her eares against the voyce of strangers, hauing alwayes before her eyes her vow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and contract of mariage: But the adulterer with false keyes crept into her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, nay perhaps by her selfe was let in by the posterne. Hee hath defiled her bed, and with that contagious copulation her beautifull countenance is become pale and gastly, her naturall colour defiled with paintings, her true doctrine infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with forged tales, in so much that in a manner she is become nothing else but falshood and lyes. Other Churches haue done their best endeuours to oppose themselues against her, as that of Africa, France, Germanie, Greece, and other the East Churches. Neither were there wanting in her selfe faithfull dogs, who, with the danger of their liues, ceased not, so long as they might to barke at him when he began first to increase, to dig and to breake through the wall, opposing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their defences, making head against him euen in the breach, vntill at the last by the collusion of the Roman Clergie, hauing obtained the end of his design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ouerrunning all things at his owne pleasure, he made the house of God (according to the prouerbe) the stable of <hi>Augia,</hi> the caue of <hi>Cacus,</hi> miserably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing all the godlie, yea pietie it selfe. From thence forward the suppressed gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the godlie brake forth, and the mournefull plaints of that <hi>woman that flew from the dragon,</hi> of our doue, the purer Church, were euery where heard. Her foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps sometimes, though flying from the face of the persecuters, you might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
<pb facs="5"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but yet by the persecuting rable vnmanured, defaced, halfe couered; Her voice amongst the Salmonean thunders of the Popes was hardly heard, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where interrupted by the noise of the sparkling flames about her, and, as it were in Phalaris bull, in the writings of the Monks, and the mouthes of her aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries (least we should lament the tortures of the godlie) turned into the bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Oxe.</p>
   <p>Doest thou aske therefore where our Church was so manie ages past? <hi>Where it fed her flockes, where it lay at noone?</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note> Heare I pray thee what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list saith, <hi>The woman,</hi> that is the Church, persecuted by the Dragon,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</note>
      <hi>did flie into the wildernesse, where shee hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one thousand, two hundred, and threescore dayes,</hi> that is, propheticall daies, a time cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and that not short. Shee is not therefore to be sought in the Popedome, in the light of the world, in the middest of pride and excesse. It is likewise sayd that the dragon <hi>which deceiued the whole world</hi> hauing great wrath, persecuted <hi>the woman, and cast out of his mouth water after the woman, like a floud, that shee might be carried away of the floud;</hi> But there were then <hi>giuen to the woman two wings of a great Eagle, that shee might flie into the wildernesse.</hi> And of a flight in the ayre there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no trace; In such sort that we are not bound to search after it, much lesse to shew it, accounting it sufficient that we beleeue the Scriptues: That God knoweth who are his: That the Church is knowne vnto God, as in the time of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
      <hi>Eliah,</hi> though vnknowne to the Prophet, whereof, after so many ages past, there is no reason why any account should be demaunded of vs.</p>
   <p>But I will not deale so rigorously with you, will you know where, and what manner of Church ours was in all your time? Our Church was that Primitiue Apostolike Church inspired with the holie Ghost, grounded vpon the word of God, which hath left vnto vs the Canon of the holie Scriptures the rule of our faith and life, the Symboll of the Apostles the badge of our Christian warfare. To vs therefore that embrace all these, and to hold and defend them, reject all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions, stoppe our eares against the voice of a stranger, the societie of this Church, spread farre and wide through the world, and, as our Sauiour saith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> continuing to the last day of the world, cannot be denied. But on the other side, against you is that curse threatened by S. Paule, who besides and against this preach another Gospell; <hi>If we or any angell from heauen preach vnto you otherwise, let him be accursed.</hi> Our Church is that which hath continued with this,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7.8.9.</note> yea hath been euer ioyned vnto it, shining with so manie and so great miracles, made red with so many and glorious martyres; For these are the miracles that witnesse the truth of this Gospell, Martyrdomes that gaue testimonie to Christ the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten sonne of God, the onely redeemer of mankind, Mediator, Sauiour, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Priest of the new Couenant, which we onely vrge, refusing all other, and are readie to seale it with our bloud: Ours therefore are these miracles, and these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Martyrdomes, since we are incorporated with them, by one and the same faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one and the same Church. Now tell me I pray, haue your traditions beene confirmed by these miracles? Can you or dare you affirme, that any of your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres haue suffered for the Papacie, for the Popish doctrine, for the adoration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the worship of Saints, the traffike of Purgatorie, the sacrifice of the Masse, Transubstantiation? By what right then doe you arrogate vnto your selues the miracles and martyrdomes of that Church, by what right, nay rather what wrong, doe you take them from vs the true heires of their faith? I would to God, wee could as truely say of their constancie. Againe our Church is that, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="6"/>
confuted and confounded <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Nestorius, Eutiches, Pyrrhus,</hi> yea <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> himselfe, who called into question the diuinitie of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne of God, and of the holie ghost, and the two natures and two wils in one Christ. Ours are those generall Councells of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon, and others; In which they with theirs were condemned and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Forasmuch therefore as we approue and embrace all these, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Catholike Church represented in them, as we neuer wandred in any thing from their doctrine, so are we not to be seperated from their bodies. Tell me againe whether you dare to say as much; And if for shame you will seeme to dare, See ye not that your Pope is to be brought into order, that he is presently to fall to the ground? Find you any where in any of those approued and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> auncient Councells any place for those your inuentions? And yet these bring vs to the six hundreth yeare after the natiuitie of our blessed Sauiour. In all which time, if those points of doctrine which we affirme, are confirmed by the holie Scriptures, Symboles, Myracles, Martyres, decrees of Councels, and contrarily those things we denie, doe no where appeare, nay are not so much as affirmed, may we not by good right and reason professe that Church to be ours? And with better reason aske you, where your Church was for those six hundred yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? <hi>Vbinam Gentium?</hi> for to say the truth, <hi>there shee was, there shee fed;</hi> Not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hill of Sion, but the little hils and groues of Garisim, the mountaines of Seyre, the pastures of Paganisme: From whence ye haue gathered, whatsoeuer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> either the proud schoole of the Pharisies, brought into the Sinagogue, or the vaine superstition of the Greeke Philosophers, into their Academy.</p>
   <p>From thence-forward the authoritie of one man by the contempt of the word of God, gathering strength in the Church of Rome, the Princes likewise, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was foretold, striuing to giue their assistance, he made and vnmade lawes at his owne pleasure, preferring humane inuentions before the diuine oracles, his decrees before the Canons of Councells, Nouelties before antiquities, things profane, before holie, borrowed from elsewhere before his owne, adulterat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfull, superstition before religion, and all this furniture of Paganisme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christian simplicitie, by which meanes the Church by degrees fell into this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> corruption, and languishing consumption. In such sort neuerthelesse, that in the middest of this corruption, this confusion, a part of our selues did still remaine, and that in a twofold manner. This Church was a part of our selues, though corrupt, cloked, and couered with wood and hay, and stubble, yea in a manner ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.</note> so long as shee stood vpon her onely true foundation Christ Iesus, so long as the saluation of man depended vpon him onely, his merit, the bloud of his crosse; Not vpon our owne or other mens workes, not vpon Popish absolutions and indulgences, and other blasphemous toyes of that nature. And as it falleth out, that the wind changing, the wether altereth, so for a time the matter hung in an equal ballance, vntill impietie ouer-weighing the mind of man, by a kind of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> selfe-loue, being prone to human inuentions, true pietie was taken away. Againe this Church was a part of our selues, and the purer part, inasmuch as many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men famous for their pietie and learning sprung vp therein almost in euerie Nation, lifting vp their heads in the middest of this darkenesse; Assemblies of Bishops and whole vniuersities striuing with all their force, against that swift and violent streame, shewed thereby the newnesse of the doctrine: But striuing in vaine, broke out into mournings and clamours and complaints, calling heauen and earth to witnesse against the Popes and their followers; who speaking with so
<pb facs="6"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cleere and audible a voice being so manie in number, and in so manie places, and that not out of any compact or agreement, but a common sence of that publike calamitie, is it not to be presumed that manie held their peace for feare, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their pure soules in silence? Such of whom the Lord speaketh by <hi>Eliah: I haue reserued vnto my self</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>seuen thousand men who haue not bowed their knees to Baal.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> To <hi>my selfe</hi> saith he: They stand to their Lord and master, insomuch that thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not doubt of them. Much lesse it is to be doubted, that there are seuen times seuentie thousand, yea innumerable numbers in the whole world; since tyrannie and corruption grew more slowly in some places than in other, and <hi>Eliah</hi> alone in Israell withstood the false worship of God. That there were so many in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> kingdomes and Countries, though we had no other witnesses to proue it, than our aduersaries, than the Popes slaues, who either concealed, or disguised what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer might be noted in the errors of true religion, as appeares by the example of the Iesuits in these dayes, let no man doubt.</p>
   <p>And these things fell out in the seuenth, eight, and ninth ages, in which the East Church was directly opposite against the West, the West at variance with it selfe, their Councells wauering, and in one and the same Councell voices di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, different opinions: we call these times the twilight of the Church, growing by little and little into an obscure and darke night; A moonelesse night, wherein there are few starres, and those that twinckle most, for the most part wandring, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fastened in the firmament the word of God. In such sort, that whither you respect doctrine or manners, this night seemed to be the last night of the Church, her brest, yea her heart, being pierst, and her throat cut; The doctrine of the onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, redeemer, sauiour of mankind, Christ Iesus, of his onely propitiatorie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, almost extinct, and reserued (if we looke into the outward face of things) amongst a few. This no doubt was that time, wherein that <hi>Woman,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note> the true Church being put to flight by the Dragon, and borne vpon the wings of that great Eagle, was enforced to retire her selfe to the wildernesse: Of that Eagle, the eternall omnipotent Iehoua, who when there is neede, knoweth how to carrie and keepe his Church, as the Eagle doth her young. This likewise was that time,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.15.</note>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wherein that Dragon <hi>cast out of his mouth water after the woman like a floud, that shee might be carried away of the floud.</hi> But shee whom thou seekest and persecutest to the death, being got out of thy sight, cutteth the ayre with her wings, seekes the steepie tops of the mountaines, where shee resteth and hideth her selfe vnder the wings of the Almighty: And shee, whom thou like a wretch thinkest to be peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in the beginning of the twelfth age, tooke her flight towards the plaine, God mouing and leading her the way, into Dauphin, Prouince, Languedock, Guyenne, the plains of Italie, filling all from the Pirenei hills to the Alpes, from the Alpes to the Appenine, with the preaching of the Gospell. At the last her enemies the Popes, exercising their furie against her, after many bloudie slaughters and massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> being rather sowed than scattered, she springs vp &amp; takes root, in Germanie, Slauonia, Hungary, &amp; England it selfe, &amp; there hath founded &amp; extended her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies: No otherwise than that first Apostolike Church driuen from Hierusalem by the furious priests, dispersed it selfe by the great prouidence of God into all parts of the world, publishing the Gospell (which otherwise had been included within a little circuit) in all the corners therof. Read, my good friend the Histories of this time, set downe by your owne writers; we produce our witnesses out of thine owne bosome; we haue no other either for you, or against you: It shall be easie for thee thereto note her foot-steps. Heere some by flocks are massacred,

there others by multitudes are consumed with fire. For feare least thou shouldest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> loose thy way, and go astray, he hath marked it out for thee, with these euerlasting cinders, the bloud of these Saints, other foot-steps, others to shew thee the way thou needest not.</p>
   <p>But thou contemnest this poore and ragged Church, though not so full of wrinkles, and proudly disdainest her natural colour, though it be white, louing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (delicious and delicat as thou art) a Church proud and glorious, in her vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of scarlet, painted with colours more glittering, though borrowed, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly lusting after nouelties. It is therefore no maruell if thou haue embraced that Babylonian Whore, beautified with false and counterfeit colours. The cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen vinyard of the Lord, like a negligent husbandman, thou sufferest to grow vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a tree, to be ouer ranke with leaues; and little care thou takest whether it yeeld weeds or grapes. But the eternall God, the true husbandman, doth not so, but humble and lowly as his vinyard is, the better to continue it in that humilitie, hee pruines it, and affoords now and then an eye vnto it, and that bedewed with tears, that it might yeeld the more and the better fruit; yea and sometimes hee pluckes away the leaues, that it may lye more open to the beames of the Sunne, and so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the better, that when they come to the presse, they may yeeld a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wine. And now thou knowest where our Church was in all this time. Thou, rude and simple as thou art, thinkest perhaps, when thou seest the Sunne to set in the West, that it is swallowed vp in the Ocean, and quite extinguished, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> indeed when it sets to thee, it riseth to others, and returnes againe to thee in his due time, and misseth not a minute. The riuer Rosne, when it entreth into the lake of Lozanna, thou thinkest it is quite deuoured, but that liuelie and running water cutteth and diuideth that dead and standing poole, making way through her swallowing depthes: Our Church in like manner hath made her way through many ages, hath runne into the lake, yet not ouerwhelmed, but hath past through the bottomelesse gulfes thereof with glorie and triumph; and many riuers meeting her, she passeth through many countries, and at the last falls into her Ocean, the Church of Christ into God, the bottomelesse sea of all goodnesse, and there is drowned, loosing her selfe to find her selfe in him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
   </p>
   <p>Remember <hi>Ionas,</hi> a figure of the bodie of Christ in the Sepulchre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his Church: Thou seest him swallowed by the Whale, and thou thinkest him deuoured,<note place="margin">Ionas c. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> and thou hast reason to beleeue too; for he saith, <hi>The waters compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me about vnto the soule, the depth closed me roundabout, and the weeds were wrapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my head, in as much that I said, I am cast away out of thy sight;</hi> out of the sight of God himselfe, if we may so say, not of men, not of his aduersaries: But <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>will yet looke againe toward thy holie Temple: Out of the bellie of hell it selfe, the bowels of that beast, I cried, and thou heardest my voyce.</hi> At the verie becke of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God this monster cast out <hi>Ionas</hi> vpon the drie land, to be sent as an Herauld to preach repentance vnto the Niniuites, a people seperated from the Church.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> What maruell then is it, that the Popedome hauing swallowed vp this poore Church, at the word of the Lord, in these later times should cast it out againe, that so the Gospell might be preached more gloriously than before, euen to your selues?</p>
   <p>But now giue me leaue to aske thee againe, In all this long space of time where was thy Church? and of all loues answer me: In those six hundred yeares next after Christ, in the whole world, was there any that was thy Church? and that worshipped, burnt incense, adorned, adored, and inuocated Images? Doubtlesse
<pb facs="7"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there was none such, except thou seeke it among the Heathen with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> not <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> In a whole thousand yeares was there any Church that called the Hoast Lord, thought it a god, adored it? In a whole thousand two hundred yeares, that shut it vp in a box, carried it about, appointed vnto it a proper feasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day, set it out with pomp to be gazed vpon by the people, as in a publike The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre? Againe, in a whole thousand yeares after Christ, was there any Church, howsoeuer otherwise corrupted, that placed Christ the sonne of God betweene the hands of a Priest, yea created him, that sold his sacrifice for money, to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at all times, yea euerie moment of time, and in all places; That abolished the auncient institution of Christ, and Communion of the faithfull, bringing into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> place thereof their solitarie Masses for the liuing and the dead, mumbled vp in a corner; That depriued the people of the Cup of the Lord, to feed them with the smoke of this pretended sacrifice? And since I am entred into it, to lay open these monstrous abuses to the view of the world, Was there any Church that accused the Scriptures of insufficiencie, or imperfection, writing bookes to that purpose; That forbad the reading of them, as being daungerous and deadly, vpon paine of grieuous punishment, and that by a publike Decree? Againe, was there any Church in the whole world, for six hundred yeares after Christ, that beleeued the Pope of Rome to be the Vniuersall Bishop, an earthlie Prince, armed with both swords spirituall and temporall; That for a thousand yeres, out of Rome, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him to be Pope and Emperour, the Lord of the world, the true Spouse of the Church; That for twelue hundred yeares did affirme him to be aboue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, the Catholike Church, the Scriptures; That did affirme or teach, That he had power to dispose of the state of our soules by his Indulgences, That he could shut Purgatorie, open heauen, canonize for a Saint, or damne to hell, at his pleasure, whom it pleased him; commaund the Angels, abrogat the lawes of God, and therefore a god, and aboue God? Adde if you will, to make vp the matter, What Church in those ages euer knew those multitudes of Monkes, the foure Orders of begging Friers, the scarlet Cardinals, this Pontificall pompe, his Ianizaries and Mamalukes, and lastly his Iesuites, who are as it were the rereward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Popes armie? And yet of these doth your Church now consist, and they must be beleeued vpon paine of damnation. Herein <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> spend their labours, and he that abates but a haire of that they affirme, let him bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Heathen or Publican. That man on the other side that beleeues all this, especially all those poynts that concerne the Pope, though he be otherwise an heretike, a prophane person, an Atheist, yet he is a good Catholike, and in the right way. It is now then your part to proue this your Church out of the Fathers, Councels, Histories, yea euen your owne, for I refuse not any.</p>
   <p>But perhaps thou wilt aske, though against the rules of disputation, By what apparent reason it appeares that your Church hath erred, and how it should bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> likely, that it hath hitherto receiued Christ his enemie for Christ his Vicar, and how and in what part that corruption thou speakest of hath crept in? Hearken, my friend, let not this preposterous presumption deceiue thee; the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue erred, our first parents in Paradice haue erred, <hi>Iacob</hi> amongst so many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of God, Israel in the desart, in the middest of so many myracles, haue erred; the Church, the Spouse of God, vnder the Iudges, the Kings in the presence of the Arke, in that holie land, though reproued by the Prophets, verie often, in the time of the first Temple, and as often vnder the second, and that which is more, puffed vp with the doctrine of the Law, euen to the forsaking of Christ himselfe,
<pb facs="8"/>
the crucifying of him with her owne hands, and consequently in her owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath erred: What then should hinder but that it may now likewise erre, euen to the receiuing of Antichrist, <hi>that man of sinne, the sonne of perdition,</hi> and the adoring of him, since both the one and the other proceed from the same spirit of presumption, not to erre; both the one and the other foretold by the same mouth, by the spirit of God in his word; and therefore of like certaintie? Doubtlesse the Church then hath erred, erred by neglecting the word of God, and shall erre as often as she shall forsake the sea-mans compasse, without which all things are to it vncertaine, the heauens, the sea, the earth: In so much that being left to her own discourse, her owne cogitations, it is no maruell if she haue erred, if she doe erre: yea rather it were a wonder, and more than a wonder, if without that compasse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> she should hold her course but a moment of time, and not bee split in peeces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some rocke, or suffer shipwracke vpon some vnknowne shore. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou desirest to know the moment of time when this accident happened, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, my friend, that this Mysterie was wrought in the darke: for Antichrist is compared to a theefe that digs through the wall in the dead time of the night. At what watch therefore he began his worke, it is your part to know, and to tell vs that stand sentinell, that haue so long time before beene forewarned by God himselfe, by whose either negligence or treacherie he hath inuaded the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and therefore your Church. But thou art perhaps sicke of a dropsie, thy bellie is swolne as big as a tunne, thy bloud turned into water, and yet thou wilt not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hearken to the Physitian, change the course of thy life, vntill he tell thee the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie instant time when thy liuer began to be distempered, to bee inflamed, to grow drie, and to be hardened into a Schyrrus; whereas thou shouldest haue beene the first that should haue knowne that, if it might be, because there is no man so neere vnto thee as thy selfe. There is nothing more ridiculous, than to thinke that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should know it before thy selfe, especially considering it is one of those disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, according to <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> that at the first is most hardly knowne, most easily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, afterwards by tract of time the symptomes, or accidents belonging thereunto encreasing, it is easily knowne, hardly cured.</p>
   <p>But yet I will not refuse to satisfie thee herein, if I can. Thou wouldest know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when Antichrist inuaded this chayre, which for a long time hee coueted, and now possesseth. It was necessarie that the <hi>Palladium, le Garde corps</hi> of the Church should first be stollen, before he could be receiued, before that fatall horse could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; The word of God, the Candlesticke of the holie Scriptures must first bee hid vnder a bushell, before the theefe durst creepe in, or make any assault vpon the Church; which still continuing in force, in vaine could that sinke of superstitions besiege it, but we kept it farre off from our Troy, our rampiers, our territories, much more from the porch, the Temple, the Sanctuarie of the Lord. That old Dragon, vnder the colour of <hi>a not written word,</hi> cunningly and closely brought in Traditions to betray the Church; which the wisedome of the flesh, their neere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> better agreeing with carnall reason, did willingly and with good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance receiue, equalled them with the Written word, the sacred oracles, made them sit cheeke by cheeke with them. This law of equalitie being often attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the seuenth age, and seuenth Idolatrous Synod, it was established, yea and by vertue thereof Traditions preferred before the Word, opposed against it. Then <hi>Simon,</hi> rather vnder the name than shape of <hi>Simon,</hi> began to appeare, by diuers cunning deuices couering his treacherie, persuading vs to receiue that dangerous engine, that Troian horse, that Epitome as it were of all the Painims impieties,
<pb facs="8"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into the place of our Palladium, the word of God. <hi>Capis</hi> then and diuers others <hi>who were of a sounder iudgement,</hi> fearing their subtilties, and finding them, cried out to haue it burnt. The most famous Fathers of the Church throughout the world, foretold, threatened the euill to come, resisted, banded themselues against it. But you vnaduised, or rather ill aduised, <hi>ita ferentibus fatis,</hi> being necessarie that the Prophesies should be fulfilled in their due time,

   <p>From thence forward he put all to fire and sword in the citie, ransacked the Church, polluted the holie things, left nothing vntouched with the infectious hands of his Harpies, powred out of that fatall horse all manner of superstitious seruices in the Church, calling this horse (although a marke of the Greekes) the Troian horse. These superstitions, Catholike, Orthodoxall, because consecrated and hallowed (these are their owne words) by the Popes, though from their bgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were Heathenish and Idolatrous.

Wise <hi>Antenor,</hi> deuout <hi>Aeneas,</hi> did not so, but breaking through the Grecian troupes, got themselues out of the citie with their fellowes, gathered together what they could, and to sea they goe, and putting themselues into the first ships they met with, hoyse vp sayles to seeke a new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and find it, and there they settle: being stil Troians whither soeuer they went, in what place soeuer they rested; carrying with them their houshold gods, and the ensignes of their countrey: Being still Christians, professors of the Catholike faith, carrying with them the word of God, vntouched by the fire of the Greeks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> keeping the Sacraments of our Lord sound and pure.
