      </gap>ogether with the Hon: Court of Parliament now assembled, that an Act of ratification may be decreed for the Religion hitherto maintained; and an Act of Prohibition for the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all Popish &amp; Arminian bookes henceforth; sith the Arminian section <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> so highly aduanced, as it can easily leape ouer all blocks &amp; Bulwarks of opposition. Againe, be pleased to take notice of one great inconuenience, if not rather mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiefe, which is like speedily to incroch vpō your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if not preuented. Some of your sonnes haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dared to add to the <hi>Cōmunion</hi> booke; as the whole forme of the consecration of Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, &amp; Deacons, being now inserted in the said book, I wot not by what authority. Yea, and if such may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to goe on, they will correct <hi>Magnificat.</hi> For if it please you but to make search, you shall find in the great printing house at <hi>London</hi> a Communion Booke, wherin the Author of the booke of <hi>private Deuotions</hi> (and I saw it with mine eyes) hath in sundry places noted with his owne hand (as they say) how he would haue the Cōmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion booke altered; as in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> or <hi>Calendar</hi> he tels where and how he would haue such a Saints day called, and where he would haue red letters, put for the blacke, and so to canonize more Holidayes for you to obserue. Also throughout the Book, where he finds the word <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> he would haue <hi>Priest</hi> put in stead thereof; such an enemy is he to the very name of <hi>Minister,</hi> as if he would haue the world belieue, he had rather be a popish Priest, then a Minister of the better Testament, as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is called, or a Minister of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Apostles were called,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.23. Acts 26.16.</note>
      <hi>I haue ordayned thee a Minister,</hi> saith Christ <hi>to Paul.</hi> And in Conclusion, for those private godly prayers in the end of the reading <hi>Psalmes,</hi> he thinkes them fitter to be omitted, then added. I doe but briefly touch them, leauing them to your fuller inquirie, &amp; more particular examination. But if such liberty may be indulged to such like Sonnes, it will shortly come to passe, that as neither

you can owne them for your sonnes, so nor they you for their Mother: such a new face of Religion are they like to induce, if they bee not the better looked vnto. Yea, what a Metamorphosis haue wee seene already in these our da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es? How vnlike is the present time to the former which we haue seene? For, as I told the L.BP. of <hi>London,</hi> it was a pitifull thing to see the strange alteratiō of these times within this 7. yeares, from those former. For for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, not a Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e countenanced and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, &amp; Orthodox bookes suppressed. It was not wont to be so, my Lord, quoth I. And let your Motherhood be pleased to make inquirie which of your Sonnes it is, that hath dared of late dayes to incroch euen vpon the liberty of Preaching it selfe, that in the most publicke place of the Kingdome, Preachers haue beene forced sometime before, to show their Sermons before they were preached, and some were not suffered to preach for their very texts sake, whereupō they purposed to preach? Alas Mother, are our diseased so desperate, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the plaister. And good Mother, I pray you well &amp; thriftily to discipline such your sonnes, as being Licencers of Bookes, dare answer, that they must not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence any bookes against <hi>Arminius</hi>; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> yet any Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes. But I forbeare. I may feare, least, as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> for bringing the euil report of his brethren to his Father so I to you, may incurre their hatred, as he did. Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>he Lord looke mercifully vpon you, &amp; your goodly family, least <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Leui</hi> Brethren in euil, indanger the whole house of <hi>Iacob</hi> to the vncircumcized.
