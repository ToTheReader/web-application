   <head>THE STATIONER
TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His, being one of the <hi>Authours</hi>
first <hi>Poems,</hi> was composed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares agone; and vnknown
to him, gotten out of his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
by an acquaintance of his.
And comming lately to my
hands without a Name, it was thought to haue
so much resemblance of the <hi>Maker,</hi> that many,
vpon the first sight, vndertooke to guesse who
was <hi>Author</hi> of it: And, perswaded that it was
likely also, to become profitable both to them,
and mee.</p>
   <p>Whereupon, I got it authorised, according
to Order: intending to publish it, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiry. But, attaining by chance a more
perfect knowledge to whom it most properly
belonged: I thought it fitting to acquaint him
therewithall. And did so; desiring also, both
his good will to publish the same, and leaue to
passe it vnder his <hi>Name.</hi> Both which, I found
him very vnwilling to permit; least the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="3"/>
lightnesse of such a <hi>Subiect,</hi> might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
disparage, the more serious <hi>Studies,</hi>
which he hath since vndertaken.</p>
   <p>Yet, doubting (this being got out of his
Custod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>) some imperfecter <hi>Coppies</hi> might
hereafter be scattered abroad in writing, or, be
vnknowne to him, imprinted: He was pleased
(vpon my importunities) to condescend that it
might be published, without his <hi>Name.</hi> And his
words were these.</p>
   <p>
      <q>When (said he) I first composed it, I well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thereof; and it well enough became my
yeares: but now, I neither like, nor dislike it.
That (therefore) it should be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ulged, I desire
not: and whether it be, or whether (if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
so) it bee approoued or no, <hi>I care not.</hi> For
this I am sure of: howsoeuer it be valued; it is
worth as much as I prize it at: likely it is also
to be as beneficial to the World, as the World
hath been to me; and will be more then those
who like it not, euer deserued at my hands.</q>
   </p>
   <p>These were his speeches: And (if you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for a <hi>Prologue;</hi> thus much he wished me to
tell you, in stead thereof: because (as he sayd)
hee himselfe had somewhat else to doe. Yet,
(to acknowledge the truth) I was so earnest
<pb facs="3"/>
with him, that, as busie as he would seeme to
be, I got him to write this <hi>Epistle</hi> for me: And
haue therunto set my <hi>Name.</hi> Which, he wished
me to confesse: Partly, to auoid the occasion
of belying my Inuention; and partly, because
hee thought some of you would suppose so
much.</p>
   <p>I entreated him, to explaine his meaning,
in certaine obscure passages. But, he told me,
how that were to take away the employment
of his <hi>Interpreters:</hi> Whereas, he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
leaue somewhat remaining doubtfull,
to see what Sir POLITICKE WOVLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEE,
and his Companions could picke out
of it.</p>
   <p>I desired him also, to set downe, to what
good purposes, this <hi>Poeme</hi> would serue. But
his Reply was: How, that would bee well
enough found out, in the perusing, by all such
as had honest vnderstandings: and they who
are not so prouided; hee hopes will not read it.
More, I could not get from him.</p>
   <p>Whether therefore, this MISTRESSE
OF PHIL'ARETE, bee really a <hi>Woman,</hi>
shaddowed vnder the name of VIRTVE:
or VIRTVE onely, whose louelinesse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb facs="4"/>
by the Beautie of an excellent <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
Or, whether it meane both together;
I cannot tell you. But, thus much I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for your money: that, heere, you shall
find familiarly expressed, both such <hi>Beauties</hi> as
young men, are most intangled withall; and
and the excellency also of such, as are most
worthy their affection. That, seeing both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tially
set foorth, by him that was capable
of both, they might the better settle their loue
on the best.</p>
   <p>Heereby also, those <hi>Women,</hi> who desire to
bee truely beloued, may know what makes
them, so to be. And, seeke to acquire those
accomplishments of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which may
endeare them, when the sweetest Features of
a beautifull Face, shall bee conuerted into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities.
And, here is described, that Loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of theirs, which is the principall obiect
of wanton affection, to no worse end: but,
that those, who would neuer haue lookt on
this <hi>Poeme</hi> (if <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> had beene
therein, no otherwise represented, then as they
are obiects of the Soule) might, where they
expected the satisfaction of their sensualitie
onely; meet with that also, which would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naute
<pb facs="4"/>
into them, an apprehension of more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and most excellent perfections. Yea,
whereas, the common opinion of <hi>Youth</hi> hath
been; that, onely old men, and such as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or past delighting in a bodily louelinesse,
are those who are best capable of the <hi>Mindes</hi>
perfections: And, that they doe therefore so
much preferre them before the other; because
their Age, or stupiditie hath depriued them of
being sensible what pleasures they yeelde.
Though, this be the vulger errour; yet, here it
shal appeare, that he, who was able to conceiue
the most excellent pleasingnesse, which could
be apprehended in a Corporall <hi>Beautie;</hi> found
it (euen when he was most enamour'd with it)
far short of that vnexpressible sweetnes, which
he discouered in a virtuous and well-tempered
Disposition. And if this bee not worth your
money, keepe it.</p>
