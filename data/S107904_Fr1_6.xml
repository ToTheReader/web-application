   <head>Thomas Churchyarde to the Reader.</head>
   <l>JF still my pen in silence slept, when wit the world awakes,</l>
   <l>And willing mynds with weary workes, great toyle &amp; trauel takes:</l>
   <l>My frendes might think I had forgot to honour learned men,</l>
   <l>And dulled spirites did daintie waxe, through piuish slouth of Pen.</l>
   <l>Wherfore though simple sight I haue in Bathes &amp; boiling Springs,</l>
   <l>I prayse the head that here vnfoulds, the force of secrete things</l>
   <l>Though sundry sercht by iudgements deepe, to hit the marke before,</l>
   <l>At rouers they but shot theyr Shafts, and dribbed wyde a skore.</l>
   <l>For Bathes did breede an heape of doubts, and few disclosed the same,</l>
   <l>Till he that wrote this skilfull booke, a forme therof did frame,</l>
   <l>And tells vs how, and when we ought, to vse the Bathes a right,</l>
   <l>Which frutes who skornes to know and keepe, is blind of sence &amp; sight.</l>
   <l>And seeking help he findeth harme, yea sometimes death withall,</l>
   <l>As doth the young babe that warmes his hand and so in fyre fall.</l>
   <l>Or as a chyld in sommer tyme seeking his thyrst to coole,</l>
   <l>Doth slip vnwares down cruel streams, &amp; drowns him self in poole.</l>
   <l>So men that seeke for medicine sweete, may sometime myschef finde,</l>
   <l>If they obserue not seasons due, to take eche thing in kinde.</l>
   <l>I wade no further in this case, read what doth follow heere,</l>
   <l>And robbe no spark of fame from him, that makes these douts so cleere</l>
   <l>Who thinks this labour well bestowed if thou therby mayst gaine,</l>
   <l>Or if in busie babling world, his works may shape disdaine.</l>
