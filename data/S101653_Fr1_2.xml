   <p>I am not so perversly minded, as not to discerne, nor so ingratefull as not to acknowledge Gods great goodnesse to our Nation
<pb facs="3"/>in granting and bestowing on us, as all things needfull for our bodies, so also plentifull and necessary instructions for our soules. Yea I behold with much joy many of the Sages of our Law, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in place of Government, adding to their skill in the Laws of this Land, and promptnesse in matters concerning mens temporall estates, the knowledge of Gods sacred Book, and heavenly skill: as for the Salvation of their owne souls, so also for keeping others from unjust courses prejudicing their eternall estate. I see this, I say, in many, I hope it in the rest: hence therefore I am induced to present this Treatise to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of all such as love Gods sacred truth, and be in place, and strive to promote faithfull and just dealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man: without which
<pb facs="3"/>two, props the Commonwealth may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but will hardly finde true safetie. So that their endeavour is highly to be commended, who imploy their thoughts and paines in upholding the same. Subtle heads may devise, and worldly policie may forge many shifts; but justice armed with insight into divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, will never, or not easily be deluded. Goe on therefore with noble and undanted resolutions, shew your selves still and ever men fearing God, and hating Covetousnesse. By rooting out of the vice in this Book treated of, take away the blemish of Merchandise, the subverter of faire and just dealing, the bane of Widowes, and Orphanes and many others, the underminer of Iustice, the staine of Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. So being faithfull in discharge of
<pb facs="4"/>your places for a short time here, God of his mercie and goodnesse will advance you to a place of endlesse blisse hereafter.</p>
