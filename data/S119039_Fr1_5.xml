         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Masters,</hi> You that slight the first Lesson of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> you that plot at home, like craftie Crowders, torcape the fruits of all painfull Trades without wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Cats feet, though the Fish bee neuer so dearely prized, you I say, who repos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> your chiefest Felicitie in playing on the Violl of Fraud, and in ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing a painted Strumpet, come not at <hi>Colchos,</hi> nor presume yee once, more then <hi>Tantalus,</hi> to touch the <hi>Golden Apples</hi> of our <hi>Hesperides.</hi> There lies a Couple of <hi>Dragons</hi> in the way. <hi>Pinge duos Angues, sacer est locus.</hi> The Place is not for you. They that labour not with sweate, shall not taste of our Sweete. Keepe yee then at home, like Clinicall Apes to your Clogges. As a blacke Sheepe among some of you is accounted a perillous beast; no lesse offensiue is the grimme Porter of the <hi>Golden Ile.</hi> Yea and the <hi>Ramme,</hi> which beares the precious <hi>Fleece,</hi> hath
<pb facs="6"/>
Hornes more piercing then Pikes to assault the assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Lozell. It is good sleeping in a whole Skin. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of <hi>Gryllus,</hi> who liked so well of his <hi>Epicurean</hi> and Swinish shape, that when the wise <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses</hi> had wrought the meanes for all his Companions to resame their manly formes from their sensuall and beastly shapes, into which the <hi>Witches</hi> of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting World had metamorphosed them, he vtterly refused to returne into a <hi>reasonable Creature,</hi> saying, that of all formes, hee best agreed with the Hogges, <hi>Epicurus de grege Porci.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is pittie therefore to reforme and reclaime any against their wills. If wallowing in mire doe so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light you, returne to your dunghils, vntill you grow fit for fat Bacon. Or else you may petition to <hi>Circe and Calypso</hi> to conferre on you the shape of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and to hisse brauely vntill the <hi>Foxes</hi> steale vpon you. O imprudent <hi>Readers!</hi> Will you still lull in the bosome of carelesse Securitie? Will you neuer leaue your carping at vertuous Proiects?</p>

      <hi>When the Raine raineth, &amp; the Goose winketh,</hi>

   <l>
      <hi>Little knowes the Gander, what the Goose thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</hi>
   </l>
   <p>Little know you what your Wiues and children are like to suffer after these stormes. Little know you, or at least your hearts, like <hi>Pharaohes,</hi> are so hardned that you seeme not to know it, that the chiefest Cause of our <hi>Decay of Trading</hi> proceeds by <hi>Prodigality</hi> &amp; the <hi>multiplicities of Law Suites</hi> nourished for some

priuat mens aduantage. <hi>Veritas non quaerit angulos.</hi> The way of <hi>Truth</hi> is plaine without indirect turnings. This is the effect and euent of your vncharitablenesse. I write not in passion, that our indicious <hi>Senatours</hi> should esteeme my words, like the fortune of <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> who was said to haue the <hi>Gift of true Prophesie,</hi> but withall such ill lucke, that none would belieue whatsoeuer shee prophesied. Now the Impost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>me is ripened, and <hi>Time</hi> the Discouerer of deceits hath made it manifest, that <hi>nothing hinders neighbourly loue, and the vnion of mindes for the execution of Noble Actions, as much as malicious rancour and ciuill discord at home.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is in vaine for mee to diswade you from enuying and inueighing at our <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> seeing our <hi>Preachers</hi> with their more <hi>Diuine</hi> admonitions haue missed to conuert you. Hisse then and spare not. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still in your customary courses of scoffing and scorning, vntill you smart at last for your <hi>Sardoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spleenes</hi> and ominous laughter.</p>
   <p>But what a preposterous thing is it, That the Member which Nature formed to vtter the glory of the <hi>Creatour,</hi> to serue like a Golden Trumpet, or sweet sounding clapper in the Bell of <hi>Gods</hi> Temple to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert Sinners, to comfort the sorrowfull should degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the proper Office, for which it was ordained? and now to become so much peruerted, as to flout at all good endeuours? Eyther leaue off your mocking, or make the World partaker of a better worke.</p>
