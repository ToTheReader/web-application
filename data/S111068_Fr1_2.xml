   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Excellent Prince, I lay at your Highnes feet this <hi>Buckler</hi> of the faith, wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and conflicts of error and truth are liuely set forth: Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseeching your Highnesse, that as I haue made it for the defence of that cause which your Highnesse maintaineth: so it may be vpheld by your Princely authoritie. Your vertue which exceeds your yeares maketh you a fit Iudge of these matters; and your princely affabilitie (whereof I haue had experience) encourageth me to haue accesse vnto you. Besides, I could not better adorne &amp; beautifie the frontispice of this my work, then by prefixing to it the name of so great a Prince:
<pb facs="3"/> who being now nursed by the Church, shall one day be a nursing Father thereof: who hauing sucked Pietie from his mothers breasts, and following the steps of his Royall father to frame himselfe to vertue, hath no need of any other examples then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall: Being the sonne of a great Prince, whose actions are rules, and his words wise instructions: Whose zeale not being confined within the limits of his owne Kingdomes, produceth noble effects in forreine countries. From whose mouth (most noble Prince) you haue learned, how difficult a matter it is to Command: How he whom God bath fauoured and aduanced aboue all, hath so much the greater account to render vnto him: How it is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy double commendation in a Prince, to obey the wil of God, because he hath more means to fulfill his owne: How hard a thing it is to procure to so many persons rest by his trauell, and secure repose by his vigilancie: How necessarie it is for him, to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him vertuous persons, whose eyes and eares he may make vse of, lest peraduenture otherwise he come last to know the truth: How carefully he ought to guide his actions, sith they are exposed to the view of so many millions, and subiect to euery ones construction: How his Wisedome ought to be armed with Courage, because a vertuous Prince must make
<pb facs="3"/> account to haue the diuell his enemie. These holy Instructions (most noble Prince) which are familiar vnto you together with the gifts of nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath abundantlie adorned you, call you to great matters, and promise great effects, and fill with great hopes the hearts of all those that feare God: Who esteeme you as a plant which God hath planted, which he dresseth with his owne hand, which he watereth with his grace, and will one day make fructifie to his glorie. For my part sith I can ad nothing to your praise, I will offer my vowes to God for your prosperitie: hoping that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will fauourably accept of my affection, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme me to be your Highnesse</p>
