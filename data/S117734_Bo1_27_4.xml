   <p>WHen you open this first leafe, imagine you are come within the doore of my
house, where according as you behaue your selues, you are courteously wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,

subiects, as <hi>the Praise of Hempseed. The Trauailes of Twelue-pence. Taylors

haue now sent you a <hi>Thiefe,</hi> that will neuer Rob you, nor picke your Pockets of more then
