   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y especiall good Lord,
the Loue which that
Honorable Knight <hi>Sir
Richard Leueson</hi> did
deserue from mee; hath
made my eare so impatient of any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by which he may be traduced to
the world, that passing amongst the
throng of variable sensures, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
how Emulation and Enuie of his
Worth, striueth to burie his Honour in
the same dust with his life-lesse body:
<pb facs="3"/>
I could not but wonder, that so many
faire parts of vertue and goodnes in him,
could be so slightly skipt ouer, and that
so cursory eyes as beheld them, could so
dwell vpon the errours and mis-heedings
of his youth. It concerneth mee (whom
he chose out of all his acquaintance, to
breath his last words in my eares, and to
make me the eye, and the tongue witnesse
of his ende,) to doe him this right, to
satisfie with my testimonie such, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better acquainted with his course of
life then my selfe was, might finde in it
more to dislike, and might therefore sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his death: to those, and for discharge
of my duetie to my honourable friende,
though departed, I haue caused these
Papers to speake more publiquely that,
which in a full hearing I deliuered to
those which were present at his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals▪
and I protest herein my sinceritie;
for as al my seruice done to him, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb facs="3"/>
in my loue of his vertue; So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my labour was mercenary with him▪
nor my penne hired: for it is sufficiently
knowen, that I neuer receiued from him
more then the rich reward of his thanks▪
&amp; acknowledgment of that cōfort which
he receiued from mee; which I hold so
deare a recompence, that I could sow dayly,
to reape but such an Haruest.</p>
   <p>What I haue herein deliuered, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto your Honour, beseeching you,
who haue vouchsafed to be the Patrone
of my Studies, to receiue this; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
my most humble duetie.</p>
