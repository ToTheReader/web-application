   <p>FIrst, it is a knowledge easely taught, and quickly learned, where there is a good Master, and an apt Scholler.</p>
   <p n="2">2 The exercise of singing is delightfull to Nature, &amp; good to preserue the health of Man.</p>
   <p n="3">3 It doth strengthen all parts of the brest, &amp; doth open the pipes.</p>
   <p n="4">4 It is a singular good remedie for a stutting and stamering in the speech.</p>
   <p n="5">5 It is the best meanes to procure a perfect pronounciation, &amp; to make a good Orator.</p>
   <p n="6">6 It is the onely way to know where Nature hath bestowed the benefit of a good voyce: which guift is so rare, as there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand, that hath it: and in many, that excellent guift is lost because they want art to expresse Nature.</p>
   <p n="7">7 There is not any Musicke of Instruments whatsoeuer, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is made of the voyces of Men, where the voyces are good, and the same well sorted and ordered.</p>
   <p n="8">8 The better the voyce is, the meeter it is to honour and serue God there-with: and the voyce of man is chiefely to bee imployed to that ende.</p>
