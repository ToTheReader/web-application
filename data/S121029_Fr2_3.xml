   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, S. <hi>Edward Gyles</hi> Knight, Accomplishment of all godlie desires, <hi>and continuance of the Loue of</hi> God and men.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR if wee ponder things duely in the Ballance of consideration; wee shall finde that the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> are cummonly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crossed and combred with the burthen of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a iuersitie; or else doe enioy (in more or lesse measure) quietnes and prosperitie.</p>
   <p>The first sort (for the most part) repine and grumble against Gods sacred prouidence; as though he that keepeth <hi>Israell,</hi> did slumber or sleepe, &amp; they are enfeebled, and faint, &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh faile, vnder the weight of tribulation; as though euen as Christ suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his glorie, So wee also should not through many afflictions enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: &amp; they turne aside to by-paths
<pb facs="164"/> out of the right course; seeking plenarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation in transitorie delights, where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found; forsaking the Fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing waters, and following broken Cesternes, that can holde no liquor; repairing to <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> the god of <hi>Ekron,</hi> as though there were no God in <hi>Israel,</hi> or Balme in <hi>Gilead.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The second sorte forgetting, that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (as fellow-members of one bodie) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed one in anothers Felicitie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to simpathize mutually, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate their ioy with their brethren; are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negligent in making their Election sure, by good workes, and in manifesting the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their Faith, by Loue and Charitie: Or, albeit they haue a most sure word of the Prophets, to guide them: yet they doe not take heede vnto it, as vnto a Light that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a darke place, vntill the Day dawne, and the Day-starre arise in their hearts: Or, they are insolent and proude of their vertues, and puffed vp, with an ouer-weening conceit of their imaginarie perfection: Or, they are tired, &amp; quickly wearied in the race of pietie, &amp; at last fall away from their owne stedfastnes.</p>
   <p>They that are attainted with these, and the like, daily and dangerous maladies, by adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed perusing, &amp; effectuall practizing of these following Treatises, shall (through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="164"/> of the God of all Consolation,) feele their infirmities, if not altogether cured and remoued, yet much diminished and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated: specially, if they applie the enioyned Medicines, in such manner as they ought; Namely, with reuerence, zeale, and faith; and if they bring a minde and longing desire to be recouered.</p>
   <p>For it falls out in spirituall diseases, as it doeth in corporall: when a Medicine is not takē in decent order, it becomes vnprofitable: And when the grieued person doth not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously couet health, all potions are vnfruitful.</p>
   <p>Neither onely the receits are here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; but their reasons are drawne out of that Booke, vnto which all humane reason must be subiect: least perhaps otherwise some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient might say, as the Prince of <hi>Philosophers</hi> did in his griefe to his <hi>Physitian;</hi> Come not to heale mee, as if I were a Neat-heard, or an Hedger, but yeelde me a reason of the things thou commandest, &amp; I will the more prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserue them.</p>
   <p>My doings shall be battered with detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Cauillation, Controlling. For some feede themselues with the gaule of Animaduersion, and bitternes of reprehension, as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Quaile liueth by poyson. But my comfort is this; that these backe-biters,
<pb facs="165"/> are not very powerfull, albeit they be fraught with carping; as the Serpent <hi>Porphyrus</hi> hath venome, but he hath it to himselfe onely, for that hee wants Teeth: and that they will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and push faintely, and so retire their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, because they can doe no more hurte; as the <hi>Waspe</hi> strikes, and then flies away, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her sting behinde her: and that by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ruinate the inuincible Bulwarke of Trueth, they will bewray their owne imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie, and fall groueling backward; as hee that throwes a stone against a Marble pillar, breaketh not the Marble, but by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repercussion breedes his owne perill.</p>
   <p>What curtesie soeuer the curious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant will affoorde me; seeing my purpose was to please, pleasure, and profite manie, and to displease, gaule, and offend, none that are godlie: whether hee that studies to doe good, though hee performe it not, bee not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; since he that is willing to doe harme, though hee effect it not, is to bee reiected; Let the vnkind traducer answere; as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> expostulated, when he departed from the <hi>Syracusane</hi> Tyrant.</p>
   <p>When <hi>Antimachus</hi> was forsaken of all his Auditors, except <hi>Plato,</hi> yet hee proceeded in reading his Booke, esteeming <hi>Plato</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize them all; So though the <hi>Criticke</hi>
      <pb facs="165"/> and disdainefull, shall contemne and deride my doings; yet if the well disposed, that hunger and thirst after righteousnes, that are poore in Spirite, and pure in heart; that mourne for iniquitie, shall entertaine them, they are to mee in stead of all, and I desire no more Readers. As for the daintie; I exhorte them to feede on the fine Flower of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whose manifold Bookes abound with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite cates; &amp; to passe by this course Beane, which is conuenient onely for hungrie Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes. But those that had rather suche dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions, out of eloquent wordes, then profitable instructions out of ordinarie termes; As though it were better to drinke poison out of a golden pot, then wholesome liquor out of an earthen cup: and those that consume the pretious <hi>Time</hi> of this <hi>Posting life,</hi> in long turning and pervsing of toyous and vaine discourses; As though it were safe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing with a Golden hooke in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where the labour will yeelde small aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but the loosing of the hooke may bee damageable.</p>
   <p>If they will not followe the Example of <hi>Marie,</hi> in chosing the good part, which shall not be taken away: yet I admonish them to consider, that though Heauen and Earth shall passe away, yet the word of God abideth euer;
<pb facs="166"/> and that howsoeuer the louers of this fugitiue world are deuoted, yet to the truely religious, the Lawe of the Lord is sweeter then Honie, or the Hony-combe, and better then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of golde and siluer; and that at last they that trie the inuentions of men in the conflict of Conscience, will crie out with the children of the Prophets, <hi>Death is in the potte;</hi> and with <hi>Ieremiah, What is the Chaffe to the Wheate?</hi> and with the patient <hi>Iob</hi> to his Friendes, <hi>Miserable comforters are yee all; Shall there bee none end of wordes of winde?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If you shall fauourablie vouchsafe to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance these few vnfiled Treatises, Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, that wisheth you the continuall multiplying of Gods graces; I shall account the fruite of my labour in some forwardnesse; and be strictly obliged euer to remaine.</p>
