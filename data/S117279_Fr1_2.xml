   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not so much the Nobility of your blood, as that of Grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you from the divine hand, which did so much interest you in the love and esteeme of that worthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ, and Author of this worke; in whom▪ Vrim and Thummim met, whose whole course being a reall, and
<pb facs="3"/>
vitall sermon, sweetly consonant to the tenour of his teaching, made him amiable living, and honourable dead in the opinion of as many as well knew him: This was the thing (I suppose) which wrought unto him from you (as well as from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of your Noble Stock and Ranke) more then an ordinary esteeme: and this is that which maketh me in nothing to doubt, but that his labours made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique under your names, shall be very welcome unto you: the worke is answering unto the man; and therefore worthy you, and your acceptance: onely this is the disadvantage; that though these Sermons had his owne toung to preach them; yet they
<pb facs="3"/>
want his owne pen to commend them unto your Honours: I well know that the expressions of holy truthes from a gratious heart by lively voice doe breed deeper impressions in thirsting and reverent hearers, then any publishing of them in dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can doe; yet this we finde in experience, that holy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary truths, this way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroad into the Churches of God, doe get the advantage to continue longer, and to become a more generall good; they may stirre up the affections, and set on-wards in the course of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse where the comforts are sure, and the honours honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring everlasting.</p>
   <p>In these ensuing Sermons you
<pb facs="4"/>
have variety the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and such notable descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the person, offices, love, and life of Christ, that by them you may not only be setled in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assurances to your further comforts, but also directed and incouraged (both in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to follow the example of Christ, the most blessed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring example unto all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. This Champion I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you both to follow unto your lives end; make it your worke to set up Christ, and his Religion both in your hearts, and in your houses. Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge none but Christ in matter of salvation; and none to Christ in point of affection: let Christ
<pb facs="4"/>
be Christ with you, and then if Christ (and if not Christ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can) be worth any thing he will make you worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he will proove unto you in life and death a Sun, a shield, even a full and an answerable good: with this Christ I leave you, and with you these ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, to be read and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for your spirituall furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the enjoyment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by Iesus Christ, desiring the great God of Heaven and Earth to looke upon both you and yours in much grace and mercie; giving unto you all the comfort and crown of Religion here on earth; and hereafter in Heaven. I rest,</p>
