                 <title>An ansvvere to the Ten reasons of Edmund Campian the Iesuit : in confidence wherof he offered disputation to the ministers of the Church of England, in the controuersie of faith. Whereunto is added in briefe marginall notes, the summe of the defence of those reasons by Iohn Duræus the Scot, being a priest and a Iesuit, with a reply vnto it. Written first in the Latine tongue by the reuerend and faithfull seruant of Christ and his Church, William Whitakers, Doctor in Diuinitie, and the Kings Professor and publike reader of Diuinitie in the Vniuersitie of Cambridge. And now faithfully translated for the benefit of the vnlearned (at the appointment and desire of some in authoritie) into the English tongue; by Richard Stocke, preacher in London</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holie Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> knowing his calling, and remembring wel his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which hee had receiued from Christ, saith: <hi>Christ sent me not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, but to preach the Gospell.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.</note> Not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hee had no commission to baptise at all, for then had he offended, when he baptised some; but that this was the speciall end, and the chiefest part of his calling, <hi>to preach.</hi> So to allude to it, I may say of my calling, that Christ sent me not to write, but to preach; so I iudge of that one talent Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me, if I be able to iudge aright of it. Which hath been the reason why I haue withstood so many motions of friends, who haue set vpon me with earnestnes to haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in print diuers things, God enabled me to vtter in preaching. And knowing the necessitie of preaching, and feeling the greatnes of the burthen, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</note> I finde all my priuate studies little enough for my publike Ministerie, that the more I attaine vnto, the more I may communicate to others. As the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher saith,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.9</note>
      <hi>The more wise the Preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge, and caused them to heare, and searched foorth, and prepared many parables.</hi> I am not of their mindes, who think that a man may gather Manna enough vpon the day before the Sabbath, to serue his familie or charge vpon the Sabbath it self. And though I know mē haue their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts, some men able to do that in an houre, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="6"/>cannot doe in three; yet I know and acknowledge my owne strength and abilitie to bee such, as that I must haue much more time than many others; which both hath made me vnwilling, and will so make me still, to distract my self, or intangle my minde with any other thing than with my ordinarie Ministerie. I haue often thought of <hi>Augustines</hi> obseruation, that our Sauiour Christ preached much,<note place="margin">De consens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Euangelist. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
      </note> but wrote nothing: and thence haue imputed it a fault to those who haue the roome of Christ, which are giuen to write much, and preach little; specially when their places in the Church requires preaching more than writing. I know well that writing is and hath bin very profitable to the Church; yet I find a corruption in our times that maketh it lesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, because I see men buy bookes more for the Author, than the matter, and delite more to haue such a booke in their houses, than by diligent reading to haue it either in their heads or hearts; by which they are neither able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in the truth, and informe in their duties such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them; neither to defend the truth of God, when they come in places where they meet with such as resist the truth, as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> did <hi>Moses,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.</note> Atheists and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists I meane, and such like, men of corrupt mindes, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the faith. And so their bookes are a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to condemne them for vaine foolish men, according to that of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.16</note>
      <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the foole to get wisedome, and he hath no heart?</hi> But beloued, let it not be so with you, or so no more, the times are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, there are many deceiuers abroad, and many daily deceiued, for that they haue had a price and opportunitie all these golden and happie daies of the Gospell to haue got wisedome, but haue no hearts, but only for wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pleasure, and such like. And if you haue neglected the opportunitie with them, thinke it high time to lay hold of it, lest it be too late, when the fit occasion is altogether past; and labour and pray for hearts to seeke Wisedome, while she cries in the streetes and seekes for you; lest you seek her when she will not bee found. And the rather, because <hi>when
<pb facs="7"/>there is no loue of truth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11.12.</note>
      <hi>God sends strong delusions, that men should beleeue lies. That all they might be damned, that beleeue not the truth, but haue pleasure in vnrighteousnes.</hi> It is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of men when they heare that many false coyners are abroad, to looke well what siluer or gold they receiue, and if they haue not either the scales and weights, or the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Goldsmith, or the skill to vse them to trie that they receiue, they will aske, and being men that haue much to receiue and their state stands vpon it, they will both haue them, and learne the skill to vse them. Should it not bee so with you? shall these be wiser in their generation, than the children of light? or will you bee wiser for the world, than for heauen? If you loue heauen, I say, not as you ought, but euen in any sort as you loue the world, and haue in any measure the like care for your spirituall estate, as you haue for the temporall, in these dangerous times get to you the ballance of the Sanctuarie, not to haue it in your houses on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in your hearts and memories. The exhortation of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is not so necessarie for these times:<note place="margin">Commentar. in Coloss. <hi>3.16.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Prouide for your selues Bibles;</hi> for most haue them in their hands and houses. But that hee saith in another place is fitter for our times:<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>3.</hi> de Laza.</note>
      <hi>When you are at home, giue your selues to a continuall reading of the holy Scriptures.</hi> A thing verely much neglected of most in our times, to whom his complaint will well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: <hi>Which of our people goe about any thing worthie the name of a Christian?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hom. <hi>13.</hi> in Joan.</note>
      <hi>who searcheth out the sense of the Scriptures? vndoubtedly none: but the Chesse-board and dice-play we finde often and euery where; but their bookes are seldome in hand.</hi> For your bookes are seldome in hand, but when you goe to Church: they lie in your houses couered with dust, and as it were spread ouer with spiders webbes, as if it seemed you durst not touch them; when the Tables are kept cleane with vse, and Cards worne blacke with continuall play. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued these things should not be so, if either you regard the commandement of Christ,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.39.</note>
      <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> which is as absolute and generall, as that Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adulterie,</hi> or <hi>steale:</hi> or if you reuerence the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb facs="7"/>of the Apostle, which is as much as a commandement: <hi>Let the word of God dwell plentifully in you in all wisedome.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.16.</note> As good schollers therefore in the schoole of Christ, giue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to these things, and vse a continuall and constant reading of the word, at least euery day some part of it: which because it is obscure, not in it selfe, but by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans vnderstanding, as men doe to weake eyes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie some holesome salue, not to make the light more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, but the eyes more able: so vse the helpe of some other writers, by which you may more profitably reade it, and enable your selues the better to conceiue of it, and to know how to applie to euery occurrence the things, which are there set downe in their most excellent and wise order, though somewhat hidden and infolded to those, who haue not their senses, as they ought, exercised therein. And if any desire some direction for himselfe, in studying both the Scriptures and other bookes, which may helpe for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them, and their better instruction in the matters of saluation; I woul intreate them first to heare the ancient and worthie Father and Elder of the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church (when as, though not without some blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,<note place="margin">Note that it is neither new, nor hereticall, nor dangerous for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to read the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Rome, in her purer times. <hi>Hieron. ad Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam de institut. siliae, epist.</hi> 7.</note> it held the foundation, which now it hath quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne) <hi>Hierome</hi> I meane, whose counsell I would make the ground of my aduice fitting our times. He directing <hi>Lata</hi> for the education of her daughter for this point, adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thus: <hi>Let her first reade the Psalmes, that by such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly hymnes she may withdraw her selfe from vaine delites. Then the Prouerbes of</hi> Salomon, <hi>that thence she may haue excellent instructions for the gouernment of her life. Then</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes, <hi>that by it she may learne to contēne al worldly things. After these the booke of</hi> Iob, <hi>that she may follow the examples of vertue and patience: let her proceed to the Gospels, and neuer lay them out of her hands: the Acts and the Epistles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, let her studiously reade and make them the delite of her heart. And when she hath furnished the storehouse of her soule with these riches, let her heedfully reade the Prophets, the fiue bookes of</hi> Moses, <hi>the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles, and
<pb facs="8"/>the small volumes of</hi> Ezra <hi>and</hi> Hester. <hi>And in the last place the Song of Songs; lest if she reade it first of all, she may happily be wounded, while she is not able to vnderstand the spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Song, set out vnder carnall words. But let her take heed of all the bookes of</hi> Apocrypha: <hi>and if at any time she will reade them, not for the truth of doctrine, but for the reuerent resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they may seeme to haue with the holy Scriptures; let her take this instruction withal, that they were not written by those, whose names they carrie, and that in them also there are many corrupt things scattered here and there: and therefore it is a speciall point of wisedome to cull out the gold from the drosse. Let her haue with her the bookes of</hi> Cyprian: <hi>let her runne ouer the Epistles of</hi> Athanasius <hi>and bookes of</hi> Hilarie, <hi>without feare of error. Let her delite in their writings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>its, in whose books is deliuered the sound doctrine of faith. Other mens workes let her so reade, that she may rather censure them, than be tied to follow them.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Hierome.</hi> Which direction of his, as touching the forepart of it, the Scriptures and Apocrypha, if any think they could better aduise, let them for me enioy their conceit, vnder their correction I will subscribe fully to it. In the latter part, because he speaketh of Authors not in our naturall tongue, in stead of them I would commend these vnto you, written originally in our owne tongue. For matter of controuersie, Doctor <hi>Bilson,</hi> now Lord Bishop of Winchester, his true defence betweene Christian subiection and vnchristian rebellion against the Iesuites. Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> his answere to the Rhemist Testament, and diuers other of his workes: and Doctor <hi>Willets Synopsis.</hi> For matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, the Workes of Master <hi>Greenham</hi> and Master <hi>Rogers.</hi> For matter both of conscience and soundnes of faith, the Workes of Master <hi>Perkins.</hi> Many other particular Treatises of speciall things there are, written by good and learned men; which you may reade as occasion may offer it, and the aduice of discreete men may encourage you. Now with the bookes of the first kinde would I commend this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular book, which, at the commanding request of an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person, I haue both reduced into one booke, written
<pb facs="8"/>by seuerall Authors in seuerall Treatises, and translated into English for your benefit. In which the greatest part of the controuersies betwixt vs and the Church of Rome, you shall finde in some part touched. The state of the question plainly laid downe, and some manifest, short and pithie answere or resolution of it. Two Papists are the opponents, <hi>Campian</hi> an Englishman, and <hi>Duraeus</hi> a Scot; one English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a famous light of our Church hath answered them both. The answere to the first was more sparing, because the aduersaries obiections were either slender, or sleightly vrged. But there is so full a supplie made thereof by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the second, that he had little stomacke or abilitie to make a reioynder.</p>
   <p>The whole worke I assure you (if you dare take my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) will be very profitable, if so be you will be attentiue &amp; diligent readers. For besides that good which is in it self, it will be a notable introduction to all other Treatises of controuersies, that with more ease and facilitie you may reade them, and with more profit be conuersant in them. The text (as I may so call it) is <hi>Campians</hi> and Doctor <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> the marginall notes are composed of <hi>Duraeus</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections in defence of <hi>Campian</hi> and the Romish errors, and the replie of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> in defence of the truth and his owne answere. <hi>Duraeus</hi> is noted thus; DVR. Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> thus; WHIT. I haue as fitly as I could placed euery obiection with his answere neere vnto that which is excepted against: and if any thing happen, by the ouersight of the Printer, or length of the note to bee not so aptly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, take a little paines to looke ouer the precedent and subsequent pages.</p>
   <p>I confesse I haue in <hi>Duraeus</hi> omitted many things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they either were not pertinent for the defence of <hi>Campian,</hi> or but the multiplication of many testimonies out of the Fathers, which haue their full answere in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or answered in some other place before.</p>
   <p>The number in euery answere noteth the page where it is to be found in Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> his replie, that any man
<pb facs="9"/>may turne and reade the answere at large, if he vnderstand the tongue, and receiue more contentment. Yet this know, there are seueral impressions of the bookes, which also dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; that which I followed was imprinted <hi>anno</hi> 1583.</p>
   <p>For the most part I haue onely in quotations set downe the booke, chapter and verse, both of the Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and seldome recited the whole words (because the margent would not beare it) but when the substance of the answere consisted in thē; and therfore you must both helpe me &amp; your selues in vsing your Bibles to peruse the places.</p>
   <p>The superiours directing you to what place euery note belongs, are the letters of the Alphabet. If there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a note and no superiour, you must conceiue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto the former note, where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> superiour is. And if the number be somtimes omitted, you must so vnderstand that the answere is in the second page where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> former is noted.</p>
   <p>The obiection you shall often finde to haue diuers parts and particulars in it, and so also the answere semblably. Therefore you must take paines for your profit to compare one thing with another, and one part with another.</p>
   <p>If you follow these directions, you shall reade the whole with no small fruit to your selues. And yet to make it more profitable vnto you, I haue in reading the sheetes ouer, as they were printed, gathered the summe of euery answere and the chiefe matter in it, not in any order, I cōfesse, which had bin a thing impossible, because no method is in it; not from any error of the Answerer, but because he was forced to follow a fellow that rode a wilde goose chase. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which epitomie may be this: If you reade the summe of euery answere, before you reade each particular answer, it will well prepare you to conceiue of the answere it selfe; if after, which I could wish also you would doe, then it will present to you the whole as it were in a mappe. When you haue read both and the whole booke, if at any time you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member some thing you would see more particularly, and can but tell or make some nie coniecture in what answere it is laid downe, with reading of one page you may finde in
<pb facs="9"/>what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> be found. Finally, let it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ther to reade this Treatise, because you shall finde in it whatsoeuer is by our late Papists in their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>phlets and Treatises, which they haue audaciously sent abroad in these few last yeeres, (when the lawes haue been laid asleepe and the iust seueritie of them greatly qualified) I say, whatsoeuer is in them either obiected against our Church and doctrine, or spoken in their owne defence, is here to be found, and a solid answere giuen vnto them, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing would giue them satisfaction. If you bee but well exercised in this one booke, out of it you may gather some smooth stones, as out of a brooke, by which, though you should not be enabled to hold any long warre with a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Papist, yet you may smite him in the forehead, and fell him groueling to the earth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the vncircumcised Philistine. The Apostle exhorts that we <hi>earnestly contend for the maintenance of the faith,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Jude vers. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>which was once giuen vnto the Saints.</hi> A naked and vnarmed man may well contend, but shall neuer be able to maintaine any thing committed to him, but it will soone be taken from him; so may I say for the truth, it is not words but weapons, and weight of diuine reason that must defend it: therefore must euery Christian souldier, that thinkes to haue the crowne, take to him such armour as Gods Armourie will affoord him. Now those weapons if so be you cannot fetch so readily in the word of truth it selfe, because of your infirmitie, they are here brought to your hand, and you withall are led by the hand to the particular places where they are in the word it selfe. Now the Lord of hosts strengthen you in the truth, and arme you with his grace, that you may be able to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the enemies of your saluation,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.8.</note> and that you may fight a good fight, and finish your course, and keepe the faith that you may obtaine the crowne of righteousnes, which the Lord the righteous Iudge will giue at the last day vnto all those that loue his appearing.</p>
