   <head>The Excellent worth
of a Penny.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Penny is a small piece of Siluer,
and therefore soonest spent: a
Penny is a very faithfull Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
&amp; the best errand it goes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is when a Rich man sends his
commendations by it to a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
The Rich-man giues, and the Poore-man
takes; no, the Poore-man giues, and the Rich-man
takes, for the Prayers of the Poore, encrease the
blessings of the Rich. Poore Penny, how much
good therefore art thou able to doe; nay, how
much good doest thou daily and hourely, when
those that are thy betters, and a thousand times
beyond thee in substance and estate, will not part
from a far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>hing. A Penny is the Doale for which
a wretched creature cries, Good Master bestowe
a Penny vpon mee: hee does not begge Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
but a Penny, a single Penny. A Penny will
content a Carier, when a pound will not satisfie a
Curmudgeon.</p>
   <p>Land in olde times no doubt was sold good
cheape, for men vsed to say, They bought it with
their Penny: But in these dayes the case is altred
<pb facs="4"/>
(quoth <hi>Ployden;)</hi> Law hath raught Land-buyers
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> speake another Language. A Penny had wont
to pay for a Pot of happy Ale: but now a Pot of
Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> defies the company of a Penny. And yet for
all this, a Penny will be a braue companion still:
olde men loue it, and are therefore called Penny-Fathers:
Trades-men loue it, for they cry, Take it
for a Pennymore. Water-men loue it, for they aske
but a Penny to crosse the Water, and when a man
hath not a Penny in his purse, then he sweares hee
hath not one crosse about him. So that as a Penny
is the least Crosse that a man can carry, there can
be no greater crosse than for a man to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Penny. A Blacke Wench, if she be Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>white,
passes for current money, where a Faire
Wench that hath no pence, shall be nayled vp for
a counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>et.</p>
   <p>A Penny then being in such extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
for the generall good it does to so many,
how much more ought wee to make of it, when
for a Penny a man may buy Wit? That Market
does now begin; And how much Wit a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
had for so small a piece of Siluer, lend your
Attention, and the History of that Penny-bargain,
shall be worth at lest two-pence to any man that
heares it.</p>
