   <head>TO MY VERY LOVING FRIEND, Master THOMAS VVHYTE, a Citizen of BRISTOVV.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I was at <hi>Norwich,</hi> in the yeere <hi>1597,</hi> I writ this Treatise vpon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as appeares therein, and delivered it unto that Hereticke, that by himselfe, if <hi>God</hi> would, he might consider and be perswaded. Since which time I have kept it by me: and though some of my private friends desired copies; yet allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wisedome of <hi>Solon,</hi> who would make no law against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricide, lest the mention of the fact might give occasion to commit it: and withall considering that it is too simple and poore for the publike view, I refused to make it common. Yet after perceiving a present necessitie, because that some began to wander in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth: and withall remembring, that if any weakling shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after entertaine this opinion, he may, before he be wholly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therewith, find the absurdity of it and be reformed; that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a novice in Christianity, who therefore doubts of the truenesse of his Religion, because he finds no familiar reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
<pb n="212" facs="228"/> but onely the racke of authorities to constraine him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; may perhaps bee hereby satisfied and finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and that they who are already strong, may by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, triumph in the goodnesse of <hi>God,</hi> who requires them to beleeve no more, then they may by that understanding, which hee hath given them, bee perswaded of: I have for their sakes who may reape benefit thereby, neglected all froward Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, not guilty unto my selfe of any offence which I can commit in making it publike. Such as it is, accept (kinde Sir) as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of that assertion, which may hereafter follow, of every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Christian faith; if <hi>God</hi> shall vouchsafe me understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, leisure, and maintenance thereto. I therefore offer it unto you, both because I know you are diligent in reading of bookes of good argument; and because I have none other meanes, whereby to shew my selfe thankefull for your manifold kindnesses and your love.</p>
