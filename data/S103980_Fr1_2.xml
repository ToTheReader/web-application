   <head>¶ We Herman by Gods grace archbishop of Colone, Archchaunceler in Italye of the holye Romayne Empire, And prynce E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectour, Duke of Westphalia and Angaria administratour of Padebourne, wysheth to al them that shal reade, heare, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this our boke, grace, peace, and blisfulnes from God our father through our Lorde, and onely sauiour Iesus Chryst.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is knowne to al men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly that our most redou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted Emperour Charles, our moost gratious Lorde hath ryght diligently sought son<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dry waies in many counsels wyth the prynces Electours, and other prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and states of the holye Romayne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Germany, wherby these daūgerous and pernicious dissēcion, &amp; altercatiō in holi religion myght be taken away, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and christian consent, and reformation of congregations myght be appoynted and in troduced through the whole nation of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manye. But because the Emperours maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie could not hitherto deuyse and constitute this general and godly concorde, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiō of churches, he, for a godly cause, and very christian purpose, enioyned, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, in the counsayle last assembled at
<pb facs="3"/> Ratespone, with the bishpop of Romes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, to al prelates, that among them selues and their diocesanes, they shoulde begyne a christian correction of ecclesiastical matters which myght helpe to a comely and holsom administration of the congregations, and that they shoulde propoune the same to the congregation to be obserued, and mayntain it with ernest diligence, and suche faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as becometh ecclesiastical persos in thys matter, neither should haue any regarde of theim, whiche woulde hyndre or staye thys godlye purpose, because he trusted that by this meane a more cōmodious way myghte be made to the ordring &amp; refurming of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that mens mindes might be prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red the soner to cōsent to a cōsultatiō of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Besides this the states of our domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haue earnestlye required of vs in manye conuocations that we would make a godly and christian reformation. And moreouer, in the last Conuocation at Bone, the Erls, Knightes, Gentilmen, and cities of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: committed vnto vs, that after the sayd maner, we should procure a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of congregations to bee gathered to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to bee pubblished, and propouned to the congregations committed vnto o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">

      </gap> charge, whiche they shoulde obserue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="3"/> hereunto that we our selues by most certain arguments of God, do perceiue daily, howe grate nede of amēdement our cōgregacions haue, because they be vtterlye destitute of godlie, and lerned ministers, and therefore no sincere, and certayne doctrine is handled amōg our men, where as yet the same ought alwaies to be preched, and taught before old men, and younge. For we perceiue that of thys neglectinge of perfecte, and pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, horrible ignorance of God, pernitious supersticion, vnbelefe, most greuous fautes and confusion of all good thinges folowe necessarely.</p>
   <p>Therefore whan we perceyued that the saide thynges preuailed horribly it semed that we ought to make no longer delaie, but rather we thought vpon the emendation of these thinges, and consulted aboute the same ernestly, &amp; cheifely in this our extreme olde age which surely warneth vs, that we must shortely come before the iudgement seate of Christ, where we knowe that we must giue an accompe of this office enioyned vnto vs. Wherefore that we myght first shewe oure selues obedient to our saniour, and the Lord Christe the prynce of pastours, and to hys flocke, and secōdly acknowlege our supreme officer the emperour and finally seke the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruacion,
<pb facs="4"/> and correction of religion among the people of Christe committed vnto oure charge, accordinge to the office of a bishoppe enioyned vnto vs, we haue applied our hole diligence hereunto, accordinge to our simpli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>citie, and the gifte, which the almightie hath graūted to vs, that we might finde out some meane to reforme ecclesiasticall doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge so necessarie in thys greate perturbaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thinges, which afterwarde we mighte propoune to our men wherein if we should not do our dutie, surely we shoulde stirre vp greater anger of God to warde vs, and all godlie men perceiue that vndoubted, and vn couerable destruction of soules wold folow thereof. Wherefore we nether woulde nor coulde delaie our purpose of a reformacion. Therefore we called to our cōsultation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men, and those exercised men, and endued wyth the feare of God, and wyth spirituall wisdōe, and lerninge, with whom after that we had had longe communication, we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered al thinges faithfulli, and at the last we ordanied the forme, and preparation folow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge of restoringe ecclesiastical doctrine, and discipline amonge our men. And thought I be their vnworthye bishop, yet I was lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made both archbishoppe, and curate of soules. And sette not furth this same forme,
<pb facs="4"/> and maner of a reformation as thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge coulde be amēded, or chaunged in it, or as though other ought in anie wise to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it. Thorough the grace of God we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the weaknes of our faith, and the slendernes of our iudgemēt in these matters of so greate difficultie, cōcerning the heauen lie kingdome of our Lorde Iesu Christe, and our saluation. But because our dere Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus Christe praised his father and gaue hym thāckes also for that, that he had hidden the misteries of the heauenlie kyngdome from the prudent and wise mē of this world, and had opened them to the simple, and despised and commaunded his holesome gospel to be preached without differēce to the lerned and vnlerned that they might attain euerlasting saluacion, and moreouer promised hys spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, by whom we vndrestande, and receiue those thinges, whiche he hymselfe giueth vs in the gospel for our euerlastinge saluation, asmanie as would seke the same in the name of his dere sonne our Lord Iesus Christ, as Christe hymselfe witnesseth, it shoulde not haue becomed vs, whiche professe the name of Christe, &amp; execute the office of a bishoppe (though we graūte we do not satisfy in both I meane in Chriistan life, and in the office of a bishoppe) to doubte of grace and gifte of
<pb facs="5"/> God and to distruste God our most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heauenlie father, as though he myght not be moued with our praiers, and the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie praiers of oure men to gene vs mercifulli his hollye spirite, whereby we myght lerne of his gospel to adourne our office enioyned by him, and to dispose, and ordain that the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple cōmitted to our charge be faithfully and diligently taught by godlie, and mete minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters howe thorough true, and liuelie fayth they shoulde acknowledge oure Lorde Iesus Christ, and confesse him to be the only saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and calle for his helpe in al trobles with a verie trust and exercise them selues in such worckes as in dede be good and fruteful, in the holye sacramētes, and other ceremonies of the church accordinge to Christes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that godlines maie daily encrease more and more, and that al thinges which be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie to Godes worde, all sinnes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that be crept in to the church of God maye be abolisched wherefore attributinge nothinge ether to our wisdome, or to the wis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, and doctrine of other but only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and trusting in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true grace, and sure promise of God the father; and in the merite and strenghth of our Lord Iesus Christ the only hed, and vigilant pastour of hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, we haue determined to set furth
<pb facs="5"/> accordynge to oure simplicite, these thynges thus gathered after diligent deliberacion, and correction, asmuch as coulde be done in shorte tyme, and asmuch as God helped vs wyth hys grace, for some reformacion of Christian discipline. For we graunte that it is our office to fede christes shepe, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to loke to the congregacions cōmitted vnto vs. And we cal God our creator to wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, whiche is euerlastinge truth, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the hertes, and seeth al thoughtes, that we in al this matter of reformation, seke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our owne glorie, nor oure priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modite, but only haue respecte hereunto that the glorie of the almightie maye bee mooste largely set furth to the euerlastinge saluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of oure men.</p>
