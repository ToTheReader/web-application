   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Had thought (curteous and gentle Reader) not to have troubled thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvith these lines; but that in the neglect thereof I shoulde either scorne thee as careless of thine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (a thing savouring of a proud hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour) or dispaire to obtaine thy favor, vvhich I am loth to conceive of thy good nature. If I were knowne I vvould intreat in the best manner, and speake for him, vvhome thou knewest: but beeing not knowne, thou speakest not against me, and therefore I much care not; for this kinde of poetrie vvherein I vvrote, I did it onelie to trie my humour: and for the matter of love, it may bee I am so devoted to some one, into vvhose hands these may light by chance, that she may say, vvhich thou nowe saiest (that surelie he is in love) vvhich if she doe, then have I the full recompence of my labour, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems have dealt sufficientlie, for the discharge of their owne duetie. This age is learnedlie vvise, and faultles in this kind of making their vvittes knowne: thinking so baselie of our bare English (vvherein thousandes have traveilled vvith such ill lucke) that they deeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves barbarous, and the Iland barren unlesse they have
<pb facs="6"/>
borrowed from <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> their best and choicest conceites; for my owne parte, I am of this mind that our nation is so exqaisite (neither vvoulde I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weininglie seeme to flatter our home-spunne stuffe, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the credite of our brave traveilers) that neither <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi> nor <hi>France</hi> can goe beiondvs for exact invention, for if aniething be odious amongst vs, it is the exile of our olde maners: and some base-borne phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses stuft up vvith such newe tearmes as a man may soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner feele vs to slatter by our incrouching eloquence than suspect it from the eare. And for the matter of love, vvhere everie man takes upon him to court exactlie, I could iustlie grace (if it be a grace to be excellent in that kinde) the Innes of Court, and some Gentlemen like stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in both Vniversities, vvhose learning and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up together, vvith their fine natures makes so sweet a harmonie, as vvithout partialitie, the most iniurious vvill preferre them before all others: and therefore they onelie are fittest to vvrite of Love. For others for the moste parte, are men of meane reach|, vvhose imbased mindes praie uppon everie badde dish: men unfitte to knowe vvhat love meanes; deluded fondlie vvith their owne conceit, misdeeming so divine a fancie, taking it to bee the contentment of themselves, the shame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the vvrong of vertue: and the refiner of the tongue, boasting of some fewe favours. These and such like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (errours hatefull to an upright minde) common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by learnlesse heades are reputed for loves kingdome. But vaine men naturallie led, deluded themselves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. For <hi>Love</hi> is a Goddesse (pardon me though I speake like a Poet) not respecting the contentment of
<pb facs="6"/>
him that loves but the vertues of the beloved, satisfied vvith vvoondering, fedde vvith admiration: respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting nothing but his Ladies vvoorthinesse: made as happie by love as by all favours chaste by honour, farre from violence: respecting but one, and that one in such kindnesse, honestie, trueth, constancie, and honoar, as vvere all the vvorld offered to make a change, yet the boote vvere too small, and therefore bootles. This is love, and farre more than this, vvhich I knowe a vulgare head, a base minde, an ordinarie conceit, a common person will not, nor cannot have: thus doc I commende that love vvherewith in these poemes I have honoured the voorthie <hi>LICIA:</hi> But the love vvhere with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus sonne</hi> hath injuriouslie made spoile of thousandes, is a cruell tyrant: occasion of sighes: oracle of lies: enemie of pittie: vvay of errour▪ shape of inconstancie: temple of treason: faith vvithout assurance: monarch of tears: murtherer of ease: prison of heartes: monster of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: poisoned honney: impndant courtizan: furious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard: and in one vvord, not <hi>Love.</hi> Thue (Reader) take heede thou erre not, aesteeme <hi>Love</hi> as thou ought. If thou muse vvhat my <hi>LICIA</hi> is, take her to be some <hi>Diana,</hi> at the least chaste, or some <hi>Minerva,</hi> no <hi>Venus,</hi> fairer farre; it may be shee is Learnings image, or some heavenlie vvoonder, vvhich the precisest may not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: perhaps under that name I have shadowed <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> It may be, I meane that kinde courtesie vvhich I found at the Patronesse of these Poems; it may bee some Colledge; it may bee my conceit, and portende nothing: vvhat soever it be, if thou like it, take it, and thanke the vvorthie Ladie <hi>MOLLINEVX,</hi> for whose
<pb facs="7"/>
sake thou hast it; vvorthie indeed, and so not onlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by me in private affection of thankefulnesse, but so equallie to be esteemed by all that knowe her: For if I had not received of her and good <hi>Sir RICHARD,</hi> of kind and vvise <hi>M.</hi> LEE, of curteous <hi>M. HOVGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,</hi> all matchlesse, matched in one kindred, those unrequitable favours, I had not thus idlely toyed. If thou mislike it, yet she or they, or both, or divine <hi>LICIA</hi> shall patronize it, or if none, I vvill and can doe it my selfe: yet I vvish thy favour: do but say thou art content, and I rest thine: if not farewel till we both meete. <hi>Septemb. 8. 1593.</hi>
