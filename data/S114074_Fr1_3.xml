   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader; thou hast here the summe of diuers of my Lectures vpon that most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Chapter the 8. to the Romanes; and also vpon those three difficult Chapters next following, viz. the 9. 10. and 11. wherein I haue endeuoured plainly to open the words; diligently to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the Argument; briefely to comprise the doctrine; and (being euidently proued) liuelily to apply the same. In which Application, I haue had a principall respect of these three things: namely, to comfort the distressed sinner; to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the obstinate; and to exhort and prouoke the penitent to more obedience.</p>
   <p>Also those mysterious points of Predestination, Reiection of the Iewes, Vocation of the Gentiles, and Revocation of the Iewes, are here soberly and diligently discussed and made plaine. Beside, diuers dangerous Positions of the Romanists, and of <hi>Arminius</hi> oppugned; &amp; many other material doubts and questions cleered by the way.</p>
   <p>As I haue laboured to doe thee good; so I desire thee, not to requite me with euill. If in some things thou thinkest otherwise; abound in thine owne sence, but censure not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; remembring that it is easier to pluck downe a house, then to build one. If thou blamest the stile as too homely, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that wise men desire rather a carefull, then an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Physician.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>If thou readest therein, read to profit thy soule: which if thou doe not; we are both losers: but thou must giue account for both our losses. For as for vs, we are vnto God a sweet sauour of Christ, both in them which profit by our paines, &amp; in them which profit not. That thou mayest profit, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to God; to whom also I desire thee to commend this labour, and</p>
