   <p>I Knowing the great honor which Almightie God hath graciously giuen vnto you, for you are his children, &amp; his holy Ghost is in you; doe therfore acknowledge my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dutie next after God, vnto you, and accordingly with humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence dedicate this my Confession, first to God, &amp; then to you his deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued children.</p>
   <p>I wrote it in deadly disease of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and in dolefull trouble of minde: my purpose was to glorifie God, and to shew vnto all people the horrible bondage of sinne; that they might plainly see it, truly feare it, and timely preuent it. Herein if any shall thinke

me ouer-harsh, and too too plaine, I beseech them to weigh in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, what it is to be at the doore of death, and the gate of hell; terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the sight of Gods wrathfull iudgement, and in continuall danger of sudden death. This is no time to couer, or to colour my sinnes, but to lay them open, that it may please God mercifully to couer them. To this ende, I doe humbly craue your Christian furtherance, in earnest praier to God for my confession, and for me. For my confession, that it may prosper against sinne: for my selfe, that I may be deliuered out of hell, and receiued into your heauenly companie: I aske no more, but to be the very lowest of all people that shal be saued. Which if it shall please the blessed God, through your praiers in Iesus Christ to vouchsafe vnto me most vnworthie, then shall I be in good hope to liue, and set forth an

      <hi>Hallelu-ia,</hi> that you may praise God for his mercie, his maruelous mercie towards you and me. Then shall you know the poore sinners name, that nowe beggeth the benefite of your praiers.</p>
   <p>Hallowed be the name of God, and his blessing be vpon Christened people, men, women, and children for euermore, Amen.</p>
   <p>Thus I humbly take my leaue.</p>
