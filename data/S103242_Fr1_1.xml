   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE AND VERTVOVS <hi>LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE, THE LADIE HARINGTON.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ADAME, the late pestilence in <hi>Couentrie,</hi> which occasioned my translation &amp;c. of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, moved me also, in part, to addresse the same unto your Honour.</p>
   <p>For being altogether restrained then, from free practise of my profession abroad, &amp; no lesse impatient of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at home, I could not readily thinke of a better course to spend that vacation, than in an Argument having a reference to mine old Grammaticall Muses, and according; in some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ort, with my latter studies in Physick. What howres therfore, either the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or diseased estate of my neighbours, together with the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine owne mortalitie would afford, I employed gladly in the said Subiect.</p>
   <p>Againe, for as much as the selfe same cause debarred me from accesse unto your house at <hi>Combe</hi> (a dutie that otherwise the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie of our aboad did require) I fully resolued at the finishing of those my Sedentary labours, to presēt the same to your view: therby to sheild my selfe (whom it pleased you before time to grace with kind entertainmēt) from the iust imputation of rude negligence in that behalfe. But now, since the same citie so dangerous the yeare before, is become a retyring place of safety for your Houshold, &amp; hath to mee alreadie yeelded fit opportunitie to excuse my former absence personally by word of mouth, I have presumed nevertheles to dedicate the same unto your Honour, as a token of my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for your bounteous favour, farre above the proportion of my
<pb facs="2"/>
deserts, and an earnest penny of that propense minde, which I carie to honour your name, in the best maner I could deuise.</p>
   <p>And verily calling to my remembrance how courteously you have vouchsafed heretofore to accept even at second hand my trauailes in this kinde, and with good words testified oftentimes the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you received therin, I had no reason to doubt the like accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that which out of a loving and devote heart I offer first unto your selfe.</p>
   <p>Lastly, when I consider, how together with sincere pietie, rare wisdome, and other eminent vertues, there is seated in your person a singular affection to advance good literature, with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie respect of learned men, I knew no means out of my small fortunes to do you greater honour, than by entituling you as Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that, which may benefit young Scholers, my countrimen, that would be learned: to give knowledge unto the word, that all the profit or pleasure whatsoever, which shall grow unto them, from these endeavours of mine, are derived immediatly from you and for your sake bestowed upon them.</p>
   <p>These motives, right Honorable, as well of my first enterprise, as of chusing your Patronage, if it please you to approue, (the onely thing that I humbly crave at your hand for this present) <hi>I</hi> shall not only thinke my pains well taken and choise as well made: prising your acceptance to the worth of a competent guerdon: but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my hearty prayers unto the Almightie for your perfect health, proceeding in a vertuous course of life, with increase of true Honour here upon earth, and after the revolution of many new yeares, for eternall happinesse in the highest Heaven.</p>

      <signed>Your Honours most readie at command, Philêmon Holland.</signed>
