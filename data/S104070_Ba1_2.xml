      <l>THere is a gift that's sacred, lent to man</l>
      <l>By God and Nature, by which Art he can</l>
      <l>Of all diseases know the perfect ground,</l>
      <l>And render the cras'd body, whole and sound.</l>
      <l>If this Art please thee then, whose hight to gaine</l>
      <l>Must be the labour of a polisht braine;</l>
      <l>Thou into Natures secrets must inquire,</l>
      <l>And (farre as humane wisedome can) aspire.</l>
      <l>From best approved Authours seeke direction,</l>
      <l>Till thou into all medcines hast inspection:</l>
      <l>And when thou shalt be frequent in all these,</l>
      <l>Thou shalt be held a new <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
      </l>

         </gap>ed <hi>Machaon,</hi> and <hi>Phillerides,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>With th' <hi>Epidaurian,</hi> godlike skill impart,</l>
      <l>And bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> Patron of that Art.</l>
      <l>Thou shalt be health to Nations, people save,</l>
      <l>And such as are expired, keep from grave.</l>
      <l>To animate the dead thou shalt have skill,</l>
      <l>'Tis at thy pleasure whom to save or kill:</l>
      <l>Hence shall great sums of wealth to thee arise,</l>
      <l>With fame, and honour, such as never dyes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But as we see in diverse flowers and weeds,</l>
      <l>Where sweetnes is, thence bitternes proceeds,</l>
      <l>And from one stalke how many thousand ills</l>
      <l>From the same Lymbeck drop, that good distills,</l>
      <l>How many discommodities attend</l>
      <l>Vpon this Art, which all so much commend;</l>
      <l>On it, how many thousand labours waite,</l>
      <l>By turning over Bookes, earely and late,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="159"/>
Assiduate study, with an infinite care,</l>
      <l>For all the sundry maladies that are,</l>
      <l>To provide wholesome medcines, how to please</l>
      <l>The sicke mans taste, and find th'unknowne disease,</l>
      <l>To know what hurts, what helps; his care being such</l>
      <l>Not to prescribe too little, nor too much.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No night in which thou downe to rest shalt lye,</l>
      <l>But ere sleepe fastens on thy tender eye,</l>
      <l>Lowd at thy gate, some one or other knocks,</l>
      <l>As if he meant, to force both bolts and locks,</l>
      <l>Calls for the Doctor to get up in hast,</l>
      <l>The patient's ready to expire his last.</l>
      <l>His bowels ake, or he complaines his head,</l>
      <l>Tossing and tumbling on his restlesse bed,</l>
      <l>Still clamoring till he perforce must rise:</l>
      <l>Thus (be it night or day) in post he flies.</l>
      <l>He feeles his pulse, to know how slowe they beate,</l>
      <l>Then must he make conjecture from his sweate,</l>
      <l>And to find out where the disease doth dwell,</l>
      <l>Forc't sometimes at his chamber-pot to swell,</l>
      <l>Then Antidotes are suddenly prepard</l>
      <l>With Amulets, and Pills, made round and hard,</l>
      <l>Emplasters are to such a place applyde,</l>
      <l>Vnguents, and Salves to this or to that side.</l>
      <l>Suppositories, Clisters, fomentations,</l>
      <l>Pultesses, opening veines, boxing, frications,</l>
      <l>Electuaries, sweating, and what not?</l>
      <l>According to the Fever, cold or hot.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He searcheth where the paine lyes most extreame,</l>
      <l>Whether it rise from Choler, or from flegme.</l>
      <l>The Megrim, Pleurisies, great or small Pox,</l>
      <l>The Measils, Wormes, the Scouring, or the Flocks.</l>
      <l>Consumption, Ptysick, laundies, black or yellow,</l>
      <l>Convulsion (or what scarce can find a fellow</l>
      <l>For suddaine killing Squinsy in the throat,</l>
      <l>Obstructions, Dropsies: each disease of note</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="160"/>
Is knowne unto him how and whence it grows,</l>
      <l>The Ague, Cough, the Pyony, the Pose.</l>
      <l>Aches within, and accidents without,</l>
      <l>Strangurian, collick, Apoplex, the gowte,</l>
      <l>Ruptures, the fretting of the guts, the Stone,</l>
      <l>Who's troubled with the Spleene, who Liver-growne,</l>
      <l>Cramps, numnes in the joyntures, Inflamations;</l>
      <l>Swelling i'th secret parts, Impostumations,</l>
      <l>Warts, Blisters, Tumours, Pimples, Tetters, Wheales,</l>
      <l>Even Leprosie itselfe, his medcine heales.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And yet when he hath used all his Art;</l>
      <l>If suddenly, the patient doe not start</l>
      <l>From his cras'd couch, and instantly head-strong,</l>
      <l>The vulgar murmur, and the Artist wrong,</l>
      <l>And say; who first begot this superstition,</l>
      <l>That the sick-man should seeke to the Physition?</l>
      <l>What madnes ist, their trifling Art to trust?</l>
      <l>If they could keepe themselves from being dust,</l>
      <l>And their owne bodies free from all disease,</l>
      <l>Not yeeld to death, when so the <hi>Parcae</hi> please,</l>
      <l>As all else doe; I should approve their skills,</l>
      <l>And yeeld to taste their Potions and their Pills.</l>
      <l>Till then; I hold them made up of abuses,</l>
      <l>Meere cheating with their Cordials, and their Iuices.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus, though they oft redeeme men from the grave;</l>
      <l>This, for their merit is the meed they have.</l>
      <l>To adde to these: the Doctor is still tyde</l>
      <l>Amongst sad folkes, and mourners to abide.</l>
      <l>Where nothing's heard but sighing for the sicke,</l>
      <l>And most contagious maladios raigne thicke,</l>
      <l>Nay, though the Plague, or pest itselfe be there,</l>
      <l>In him there must be found no cause of feare:</l>
      <l>Such are the hazards and the toyles we know,</l>
      <l>Best Artists still are forc't to undergoe.</l>
