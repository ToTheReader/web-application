And also know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall how barbarously within these his Maiesties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they are (to the shame of our time) broken downe, and vtterly almost all ruinated, their brasen Inscriptions erazed, torne away, and pilfered, by which inhumane, deformidable act, the honourable memory of many vertuous and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons deceased, is extinguished, and the true vnderstanding of diuers Families in these Realmes (who haue descended of these worthy persons aforesaid) is so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance is thereby partly interrupted: grieuing at this vnsufferable iniurie offered as well to the liuing, as the dead, out of the respect I bore to venerable Antiquity, and the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to continue the remembrance of the defunct to future po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie; I determined with my selfe to collect such memorials of the deceased, as were remaining as yet vndefaced; as also to reuiue the memories of eminent worthy persons entombed or interred, either in Parish, or in Abbey Churches▪ howsoeuer
<pb facs="5"/>
some of their Sepulchres are at this day no where to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither their bones and ashie remaines in any place to bee gathered. Whereupon with painefull expences (which might haue beene well spared perhaps you will say) I trauailed ouer the most parts of all England, and some part of Scotland; I collected the Funerall Inscriptions of all the Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the one, and in some of the other, and euer by the way gathered such as I found in Parochiall Churches▪ I likewise tooke view of many ancient Monuments not inscribed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of the Church officers, or others the inhabitants, for whom such and such Tombes or Sepulchres were made and erected, which was told me according to that truth which was deliuered vnto them by tradition: after all this scrutinie, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so few, or none at all in many Churches (time, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie of wicked people, and our English profane tenacitie, hauing quite taken them away for lucre sake) I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discouraged to proceede any further in this my laborious and expencefull enterprise; vntill I came casually into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my deare deceased friend, <hi>Augustine Vincent,</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Windsor Herald, &amp; keeper of the Records in the Tower, who perswaded me to goe forward as I had begun, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gaue me many Church-Collections, with diuers memorable Notes, and Copies of Records, gathered by himselfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and by his meanes I had free accesse to the Heralds Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to write out such antiquities as I could there finde for my purpose.</p>
   <p>But aboue all, I am most bound to loue the foresaid <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> memory, for that he made me knowne to that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> Knight and Baronet; who forthwith apprehending the scope and drift of this my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (his generous disposition being alwaies ready to afford his best furtherance to other mens industrious labours) gaue me his able directions, and withall, lent me out of his inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Librarie, such Bookes and Manuscripts as were most fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for my vse.</p>

   <p>He died at his house in Westminster the sixt of May, about ten of the clocke in the forenoone, <hi>Anno</hi> 1631. being aged, threescore yeares, three moneths, and some few odde dayes:
<pb facs="6"/>
He tooke to wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> one of the daughters and heires of <hi>William Brocas</hi> Esquire, by whom hee had issue, onely one Sonne, Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> Baronet, now liuing; who married <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of the Lord <hi>William Howard,</hi> grandchild to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of Norfolke, by whom hee hath issue, one Sonne, named <hi>Iohn,</hi> and two Daughters, <hi>Lucie</hi> and <hi>Francis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But to returne: I haue had many helpes, I confesse, from Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> Knight, and <hi>Iohn Selden</hi> Esquire, the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antiquaries now liuing of our times: nor haue the helpes beene few which I haue long receiued from the well furnisht, and daily increasing Librarie of Sir <hi>Simonds D'Ewes</hi> Knight, whose iudicious directions, and ready assistance, were as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vouchsafed vnto mee, as I had occasion to request, and whose long studied, and still intended labours for the publique good, though in another kinde, may in due time make his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and themselues deare vnto posteritie: Diuers of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds haue much furthered these my intended designes; namely, Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> Saint <hi>George,</hi> Knights▪ <hi>Iohn Philipot,</hi> and <hi>William Le Neue,</hi> Esquires, which I shall euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as occasion presents it selfe.</p>
   <p>Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> when hee compiled the Chronicles of the English Saxons, had all the helpe that might be of the Bishops and learned men of this Land. <hi>Cymbertus</hi> wrote vnto him all that was done in Lincolnshire: <hi>Nothelmus</hi> also sent vnto him all that he had gathered together in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent. <hi>Alcuinus</hi> gaue him his labours and collections for the Prouince of Yorke. <hi>Daniel</hi> of Winchester made him priuie of all that was done amongst the west Saxons: And from all other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Land, were Letters, Scrowles, and writings, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto him by messengers, to aide and assist him in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, as he doth himselfe acknowledge in his Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to <hi>Ceolnulph,</hi> King of the Northumbers.</p>
   <p>Now generous Reader, as hee had these helpes for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of his Ecclesiasticall Historie, and as I haue had the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable assistance of many of my good friends, studious in this kinde, for the finishing of this first part, and the rest of the worke now in hand, which is already in a good forwardnesse,
<pb facs="6"/>
let me intreate thy furtherance in the same thus farre, that, in thy neighbouring Churches, if thou shalt finde any ancient funerall Inscriptions, or antique obliterated Monuments, thou wouldst be pleased to copie out the one, and take so much rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other as tradition can deliuer; as also to take the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and Epitaphs vpon Tombes and Grauestones which are of these times; and withall to take order that such thy collections, notes, and obseruations may come safely to my hands; and I shall rest euer obliged to acknowledge thy paines and curtesie.</p>
   <p>And I would earnestly desire the Tombe-makers of this Citie of London, and elsewhere, that they would be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of posteritie, as to preserue in writing the Inscriptions or Epitaphs which they daily engraue vpon Funerall Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from whom I shall expect the like kindnesse, and to whom I will euer remaine alike thankfull. For, I intend, God willing, hereafter to publish to the view of the world, as well the moderne, as the ancient memorialls of the dead through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Maiesties foresaid Dominions, if God spare me life; if not, it is enough for me to haue begun, as <hi>Camden</hi> saith in his Epistle to the Reader of his booke <hi>Britannia,</hi> and I haue gained as much as I looke for, if I shall draw others, when I am dead, into this argument; whose inquisitiue diligence and learning, may finde out more, and amend mine.</p>
   <p>It may seeme, peraduenture, vnpleasing to some, for that I do speake so much of, and extoll the ardent pietie of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in the erecting of Abbeyes, Priories, and such like sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Foundations.</p>
   <p>To the which I answer with <hi>Camden,</hi> that I hold it not fit for vs to forget, that our Ancestours were, and we are of the Christian profession, and that there are not extant any other more conspicuous and certaine Monuments of their zealous deuotion towards God, then these Monasteries with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, for the maintenance of religious persons, neither any other seed-plots besides these, from whence Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and good literature were propagated ouer this our Island. Neither is there any other act of pietie more acceptable
<pb facs="7"/>
in the sight of Almighty God, then that of building Churches, Oratories, and such like sacred edifices, for the true seruice of his heauenly Maiestie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the first Christian King of Kent, hauing built S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church London, and diuers other Churches and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous structures, as I shew hereafter, is thus commended to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie by this Epitaph following, which passed with applause no question in those dayes.</p>

      </note>The pious care likewise and gracious intention of our late Lord and Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory, had, for the repairing of the foresaid Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the earnest desire and purpose, which our dread Lord and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne now hath (proceeding out of his zeale to Gods glory and his diuine worship) for the repairing and vpholding, as his Father intended, of that venerable large Fabricke and goodly Pyle of building, will be had in remembrance to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and their names will be registred in the booke of the liuing.</p>
   <p>And the munificent allowance towards the said worke from <hi>William Laud,</hi> now Lord Bishop of London, of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds by the yeare, while he doth contiune there Bishop, shall be commended, and had in remembrance of all his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours for euer.</p>
   <p>It may, perhaps, bee distastfull to some for that I write so fully of the fall and backsliding of Religious Persons from their primitiue zealous ardour of piety, making that the maine cause of the dissolution of Abbeyes: which I doe, for that some are of opinion,<note place="margin">

            <desc>〈1 paragraph〉</desc>

      </note> that because many of these Monasteries were built vpon the occasion of rapine and bloud, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereby thinking to expiate their guilt, and make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="7"/>
for their sinnes (an errour in point of Diuinitie) these sacred structures howsoeuer consecrated to the seruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, could not stand fast, nor continue in one and the same state for many ages; therefore I thinke it meete and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to discouer and lay open to the world, the manifold enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the professed votaries residing in such religious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; that it may euidently appeare that it was not the sinnes of the Founders (of whose pious intentions we ought to haue a more reuerend opinion) that their donations were of no longer continuance but that the delinquencies of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders themselues, were the sole cause of their owne vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter subuersion.</p>
   <p>I may, perhaps, be sound fault withall, because I doe not chorographically and according as Churches stand, neare or further remote in one and the same Lath hundred or wapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, emprint and place the Funerall Monuments in this my booke; but slip sometimes from one side of a County to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before I emprint and Epitaph. To which giue me leaue to make this answer, that hauing found one or two ancient Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall inscriptions, or obliterated Sepulchers, in this or that Parish Church, I haue ridden to ten Parish Churches distant from that, and not found one. Besides I haue beene taken vp in diuers Churches by the Churchwardens of the Parish, and not suffered to write the Epitaphs, or to take view of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents as I much desired, for that I wanted a Commission; which would greatly haue encouraged me (and still it would) as that of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight did <hi>Iohn Leyland,</hi> in the prosequution of this businesse.</p>
   <p>I conclude the Epitaphs and Funerall inscriptions in this booke as I finde them engrauen, with a <hi>cuius anime propitietur Deus</hi>: or with God pardon his soule; which some may say might haue beene as well left out of my booke, as they are in many places scraped out of the brasse: And I write the Latine in the same manner as I finde it either written or imprinted, as <hi>capud</hi> for <hi>caput, nichil</hi> for <hi>nihil,</hi> and the like; as also E vocall, for E dipthong, dipthongs being but lately come into vse. And now I hope that neither the conclusion of the one, nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb facs="8"/>
of the other will seeme any way offensiue to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Reader.</p>
   <p>I likewise write the Orthographie of the old English as it comes to my hands; and if by the copying out of the same it be any manner of wayes mollified, it is much against my will, for I hold originalls the best; whereby some may obiect the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of my vnlaboured stile, and the rough hewen forme of my writing. To which I reply, that this my kinde of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is incapable of all eloquent speech.</p>
   <p>When I cite <hi>Ouid</hi> or <hi>Lucan,</hi> I vse those exquisite translations of <hi>George Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>dys,</hi> and <hi>Thomas May</hi> Esquires.</p>
   <p>Some will say, that the Epitaphs of London are already prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and true it is that some are, especially such as are of later times, with which I do not meddle at all, onely I set downe those of more antiquitie, which haue either beene omitted in the collection, or for which I haue some historicall elucidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the better vnderstanding of the qualities of the parties defunct and interred.</p>
   <p>Hauing had the helps and collections of many, my Reader may finde errours in some, which hereafter I shall studie to amend; intreating in the meane time a fauorable construction.</p>
   <p>Many are the errataes, I am afraid, which will be found in the printing, the greatest I haue met withall I haue amended, not doubting but some also of consequence haue escaped mee; and for those of lesser note, I haue passed them ouer, desiring my Reader to correct and pardon.</p>
   <p>Thus, curteous Reader, submitting my selfe, and this worke, to thy learned and friendly censure, I take my leaue.</p>
