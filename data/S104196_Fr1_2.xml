   <head>TO ALL THE FAITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
flocke of Christ, grace and
peace from God the Creatour, Christ the
Redeemer, and the holy Ghost the
comforter.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie are the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(beloued in the
bowels of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus)
and volumes of
the faithfull left as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
to the Church
of Christ: which as
they are y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true riches
(for they are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:)
so ought they to
be reuerenced, not onely with outward seruice of
body, but also with inward submission of soule.
Among which monumentes, being the treasure
of the Church, and such iewels in deede as the
price of them is inualuable: this excellent worke,
(though wanting bignesse, yet ful of brightnesse)
of that most learned, godlie, faithfull, zelous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and in all points praise worthie Protestant,
Maister Iohn Hooper, Bishop of Glocester and
worcester, challengeth no small title of dignitie.
<pb facs="3"/>
For, if the wordes of our Sauiour be true, (which
to improue what incestuous mouth, without
horrible blasphemie, a trespasse vnpardonable,
dare presume, seeing he is the verie substance of
truth it selfe?)<note place="margin">Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance required in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the trueth.</note> that he is a true disciple of Christ,
which continueth to the end: then is it the dutie
of vs all, except we hide our profession vnder the
hiue of hypocrisie: not onely by looking at the
life of such a loadesman, to reforme our defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:
but also, by tracing ouer and through the
testimonies of the trueth (such godlie bookes I
meane as are left in writing to the worlde, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
assurances of an vnspotted conscience) to
thanke God for so singular an instrument of his
Gospell: &amp; to beseech him to worke in vs the like
loue his law, that we may be partakers of such
glorie, as (no doubt) this notable Martyr of God
doth immortally enioy. Of whom breefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and say somewhat (because the brightnesse of
such a glittering starre, cannot bee ouercast with
the cloudes of obscuritie and darkenesse) shall be
a meanes to make the worke more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
although (in very deed) precious things haue
their proper price, and therefore consequently wil
haue their deserued praise.<note place="margin">An abridg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of Bishoppe Hoopers life, and death, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cūstances.</note> And first to touch his
blessed beginning, blessed (I say) euen frō aboue
with the dewe of Gods grace, his education in
Oxford, his prosperous proceeding in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Diuinitie, his forsaking not onely of the
Vniuersitie, but also his common Countrie, his
flight into Germanie, his returne into Englande,
<pb facs="3"/>
his painefulnesse in preaching, his fame and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
among the people, his obteined fauour with
the Kings maiestie,<note place="margin">Bishop Hooper in estimation with King Edward y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sixt.</note> his aduauncemēt to more thā

of papistrie, his supplantation by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
cōspiraces, his faithfull continuance notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in sowing sincere doctrine, his painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in hearing publike controuersies, his visiting
of scholes and founteines of learning, his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of godlie discipline, his want of parciali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in iudgement betwixt person and person, his
Bishoplike behauiour abrode in his Dioces, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection at home towardes his house and
familie, &amp;c. do warrant him the name of a Saint
vpō earth: &amp; surely God hath registred him in the
Kalendar of his chosen seruāts in heauen. Againe
the falling away of his fauourers when religion
languished, the malicious practises of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
threatening his destructiō, the bloudthirstie
broching of his persecution, his appearing before
the Queene and her Councell, the tyrannicall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies

his milde purgation, his vndeserued depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his cruell imprisonment, his harde intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his lamentable lodging, his succourles sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
his pitifull complaintes, his restlesse tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
his streight examinations, his apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
aduouchments, the cōmitting of him to the
Fleete, the tossing of him from the Fleete to the
Counter in Southwarke, from the Counter in
<pb facs="4"/>
Southwarke to the Clinke, from the Clinke to
Newgate, his vniust degradation, his cruell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and his lamentable execution, &amp;c. all
these pageantes considered, as they were done,
woulde make a flintie heart to mealt, and stonie
eyes to sweate, not onely water, but also bloude:
and to be short, the whole bodie, though all the
lims thereof were as strong as steele, euen for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake to tremble. This comming within the
compasse of my poore consideration,<note place="margin">If Christe the heade haue bene persecuted euen to the death, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers must needes bee subiect to affliction.</note> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that Christ Iesus, the onely begotten sonne
of the almightie &amp; eternal God, had passed the like
yea and worse perilles: as by the historie of his
death and passion may appeare: that the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr,
S. Steeuen had his tormenters, S. Paule
the Apostle his persecuters, and other of Christes
disciples their afflicters: then thought I, that these
sanctified vessels made their vocation honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
euen by their deathes, which were opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
and therefore, howe can it bee, but that this
our Martyr, worthie Bishop Hooper, offering
vp his body a burnt sacrifice, liuely, reasonable, &amp;
acceptable vnto God, shoulde giue good credit to
his doctrine, assure his profession, affirme his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp; liue in euerlasting memorie, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
of his bookes, though his fauour be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and his body consumed? Of such a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
so valiantly fighting vnder the ensigne of his
Capteine, I cannot say sufficient. Of this I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
that although his earthly tabernacle bee
destroyed:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> yet hath hee a building giuen him of
<pb facs="4"/>
God, euen an house not made with handes, but
eternall in the heauens, where God graunt vs all
to reigne,<note place="margin">The lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of his life for the Gospels sake, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth be liefe and reuerence.</note> as ioynt heires with Christ his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
To proceede and approch neerer to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(for the premisses are effectuall enough, to
breed beleefe, and to kindle reuerence, in the heart
of any true Christian, towardes this our excellent
Martyr, replenished with the abundance of Gods
holy spirit) I commende vnto thy minde (good
reader,) a good work of this so good a mā: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Certaine expositions vpon the 23. 62. 72. and 77. Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the Prophet Dauid,</hi> of the which the three
last (being gathered together by a godly professor
of the trueth M. Henrie Bull) were neuer before
printed. Their beginnings are vsually read in this
maner. 23. <hi>The Lord feedeth me, &amp; I shal lack nothing 62.
My soule truly waiteth vpon God. 72. Truly God is louing
vnto Israel, euen vnto such as are of a cleane hart. 77. I wil
crie vnto God with my voice, euē to God will I crie with my
voice, &amp; he shall hearken vnto me.</hi> The expositions of
which psalmes to be pithie, &amp; profitable, this may
be a substantial proofe: because they were written
in the time of his trouble, whē (no doubt) he was
talking in spirit with God: &amp; being so occupied,
his exercises could not but be heuenly, &amp; therfore
effectuall, fruitfull, and comfortable. Come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> sorrowing soule, which gronest for reliefe
to this spring. Come hither, &amp; heare what a good
man wrote <hi>ex carcere &amp; vinculis,</hi> out of bonds and
imprisonment, for thy consolation. Heare him
once, heare him twise, heare him often, for thou
<pb facs="5"/>
for thou canst not heare him enough. He giueth
thee a pleasaunt Pomander, vouchsafe it the
smelling: he soundeth swete musicke, it deserueth
good dansing: he bidds thee to a sumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
bee not deintie in feeding: he presenteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee a pretious diamond, it is worth the taking:
Oh giue God thanks for all, &amp; glorifie the Lords
name, whome it hath pleased to plant in his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard
so fruitefull a vine, which beareth grapes
Gods plentie, of whose iuice ô Christ vouchsafe
vs to tast, that our vessels beeing seasoned with
true sanctification, they may be made sweete to
receiue and preserue the water of the riuer of life,
flowing from the liuely rocke Christ Iesus: to
whom, with the Father, and the Holy ghost,
one Trinitie in Vnitie, be all laud
and praise euerlasting,
Amen.</p>
