   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, <hi>ROBERT,</hi> Earle of WARWICK: And to the Right Honourable, the Lady <hi>SVS ANNA,</hi> Countesse of WARWICKE; His pious CONSORT.</head>

      <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two things common to man, whose nature is capable of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: one is an appetite of Honour; the other a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himselfe about the matter or way of Honour: Ambition stirres up the one, and Ignorance causeth the other; that swels, this poysons the heart of man.
<pb facs="3"/>
The first Humour did so farre transport some Ancients, that they placed very Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie in Honour, and made strange and unnaturall Adventures for the same. The second, as an Evill, made them to make that to be Honour, which is not; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that to be Honour, which is Honour indeed. It is no Honour, to be wicked; nor yet a way to Honour, with God, or good men: and yet some men doe <hi>glory in their shame,</hi> accounting Besenesse it selfe to be their Honour.</p>
   <p>It is the highest Honour (and indeed, nothing so truly ennobleth) to be truly gracious, and godly; and yet, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men, Religion and Godlinesse are thought staines and blemishes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ignobling Greatnesse it selfe, which they shun, as the greatest shame. The Scriptures make Godlinesse the formall and intrinsecall Cause, and Root of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Nay, it is and was the opinion of the most moderate Philosophers, That Vertue is the proper <hi>Basis</hi> of Honour; and that it doth belong to Vertue, as a Debt; and so much as vertuous, so much
<pb facs="3"/>
honourable: and though it did not make, yet it did dresse a Morall happinesse. The Honour of being vertuous, is great to all; most, unto Personages whose bloud runnes Noble, and Places are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: the World eyeth such most, and are willing to see, if they will shine; and readie to commend, if they will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When great ones are but in the common way of honouring God, which is meerely formall, and verball; this is pleasing, and many times winning name and fame unto themselves: But, when they are found upon the speciall way of honouring God, which is radicall, and vitall, the heart being inwardly affected with the love and purpose, and the life full of the courses and discourses of Godlinesse; this makes Nobilitie it selfe glorious, and eminently to shine: And certaine it is, that such shall have from God the Honour of secret Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, speciall Protection, externall Publication, and of eternall Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they being all Heires under Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>This honour, in all eminency, I wish unto your Honours, by how much the more God hath already advanced and enlarged your Names and Families, not onely in many outward, but also in many choise and spirituall respects For your further helpe herein, I make my selfe bold to present you with certaine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, heretofore preached by D. <hi>Sibbs</hi>; a man whose pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For mee to commend the Author unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, were to make the World to judge him either a stranger unto you, or a man that had not ingratiated himselfe with you, whilest hee lived neere unto you: I well knew, that he had an Honourable opinion of you both, and of yours; and that maketh me not blush, to passe these his owne Labours under your Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

dead) yet speaking unto you. Looke upon the Worke with acceptance, for the Fathers sake; and let the World know, that he was a man so deservedly respected of you, that his learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shall profit you; and you by them, may be quickned in all the passages of your life, to Honour that God who hath so much Honoured you: which is the heartie desire of</p>
