   <p>THere are two bookes that goe under a mothers name; <hi>A Mothers Blessing; A Mothers Legacie:</hi> now thou see'st a <hi>Mothers Teares.</hi> And this last containes all. In this a sorrowfull Mother <hi>weepes for her Child, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for her Child, and cannot bee comforted, because he is not:</hi> Call it a <hi>Mothers Teares.</hi> In this a sorrowfull Mother pleades for her Child, begs for her Child, prayes for her Child: <hi>That the good will of him that dwelt in the Bush, would incline his heart to feare the God of his Fathers,</hi> according to the patterne of wholesome words, call it, <hi>A Mothers Blessing.</hi> And because thy Mother, almost worne out with <hi>yeares</hi> and <hi>teares,</hi> is now lying downe in sorrow, and not likely to see thy face, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou wilt hasten; shee bequeathes this unto thee as her last will and Testament. Call it a <hi>Mothers Legacie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now Child, I think fit to satisfie thee in two things, both touching the Impression of this
<pb facs="3"/> booke. The first shall giue the reason of it: the second shall (I hope) put away the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thou mayst take at it. To the first I haue this to say, that finding most things (as I thought) coutcht in thy letter, which haue and may draw, and hold, the unstable minds of <hi>nouices,</hi> who haue not <hi>laid the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples right,</hi> I could not, whether for want of witt, or too much propensitie to talke (both if thou wilt, it is no great impeachment to a woman) coutch my answer within the scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a letter. Whence it hapned, that a friend desiring a Copy, tooke a readier way for 500, then he could with his pen transcribe one, and so printed it beyond the seas. And before any of them came to my hands, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse were dispersed, being first taken at the Custome house, then shrifted for Papists, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dismist by a large indulgence: Whence the bookes came to me just in the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Papist returnes from his confessour. The booke had its pardon: It's true; and his outside was as faire as <hi>Pilates</hi> hands, but the inside was <hi>in statu quo prius</hi> as foule as before. The truth is, the booke had so many faults, as that it was not fit to passe with them. That put me upon some second thoughts, which made the booke much bigger; and now it is free for any hand. The <hi>white</hi> it aymes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, is
<pb facs="3"/> thy returne, which if it hit not, yet I hope it will keepe some from going to thee. I know not, said a wise man, whether I shall profitt him, I doe admonish; but this I know, If I warne many, one or another will receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Spread thine hand, and let the seed fall, some may fall in good ground; <hi>Sen. Epist.</hi> 29. <hi>Let thy hooke alwayes hang,</hi> It is a <hi>Prouerb;</hi> that may bite, thou look'st not for, in a time thou think'st not of. <hi>Cast thy Nets;</hi> So is that, though thou tak'st not a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, thou maist a Trout; suppose it bee a lesse fish, it will bee welcome. If I cannot catch men, I can bee contented to catch boyes, yea Children: I am a debtor to them. If any thing come: <hi>why should I sacrifice to my nett?</hi> If nothing, and so my night labor be lost: I know the reason. The Lord teach his professed <hi>Fishers to cast their netts on the right side of the boate, that they may finde:</hi> Sure this is the time, the waters are troubled. And so much for the first, wherein I desire to giue full satisfaction, so doe I in the second; which followeth.</p>
   <p>If thou shalt say, thy renting from us will be knowne now. Alas Child, if that could haue beene help't, thy mother would haue put to <hi>both</hi> hir <hi>shoulders.</hi> Yea but this will make it more notorious. I cannot tell y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>; but
<pb facs="4"/> be it so; then also it will make thy returne the more gracious. And the more shall take notice of thy departing from us, the more will praise God for thy returne unto us: so that this will be no more thy disgrace, then was that letter of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> a disgrace to <hi>Onesimus,</hi> onely let thy returne be like his, <hi>who departed for a season, that hee might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for euer.</hi> But say what can be said, this is certaine, hee that is truly turn'd, little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes his owne grace: so God may haue the glory. I find the Saints boasting of their infirmities, blazing their faults, none more; <hi>I was a Publican,</hi> so <hi>Matthew: I was a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> so <hi>Paul:</hi> But sparing in setting forth their excellencies, their abilities; if it must be done as sometimes it must, that God may haue the glory; it shall be done in the third person; <hi>The Disciple whom Christ loued:</hi> So <hi>Iohn</hi> of himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>I knew a man; whether in the bodie▪ or out of the bodie.</hi> I cannot tell &amp;c. So <hi>Paul</hi> of himselfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. And why so? God must bee exalted, man must be laid low. I adde, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with it, <hi>when it shall please God to reueale his Son unto thee, thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> not then consult with flesh and blood. Gal.</hi> 1. 16▪ So much to the Child.</p>
   <p>Something to thee Reader, at large: the
<pb facs="4"/> bait is laid for thee too: for I <hi>go a fishing.</hi> This book concernes that particular relation thou stand'st in, as a parent, or as a child, or both. Thou see'st a <hi>Mothers Teares;</hi> thou see'st al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Child hath caused them. Art thou a Child? <hi>then heare the Instruction of thy Father, and forsake not the Law of thy Mother;</hi> why shouldest thou cause thy <hi>Parents Tears?</hi> Thy Mother hath groan'd for thee already, make her not grone againe: How canst thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>A Mothers Teares?</hi> Art thou a Parent? Thy child is a doubtfull commodity: There is a peradventure in all things good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill under the Sunne, that may befall him, except one. It is borne, perhaps it may grow up, perhaps not, and so on, perhaps so, perhaps not. Thou canst not say, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may die, perhaps not; that is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as other things are uncertaine: if it doe <hi>grow up like the floure, it shall be cut downe like the grasse:</hi> no peradventure there. But in all things, else there is nothing thou canst looke on, that is subiect to more hazard. It may miscarry for want of thy care, so may it notwithstanding all thy care. See what a barren piece of mould thou hast let unto him! It brings forth nothing of it selfe but <hi>briars</hi> and <hi>thornes;</hi> and doe what thou canst doe, they will shut forth. That thou maist
<pb facs="5"/> make it happily fruitfull; thou must to <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> thou must to <hi>watering;</hi> so much thou art bound to doe, for thou art his debtor; more thou canst not doe, thou art but a man: weedes come up of themselues, good corne not so: flesh is propagated, not spirit. Thou canst but speake to the eare, by all thy <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by all thy <hi>wat'ring;</hi> it is <hi>God that boares it,</hi> so <hi>giuing your increase.</hi> Thou canst not adde to the <hi>stature,</hi> the one or the other: yet let me thrust in one thing by the way; I finde obedience pre'st upon the parent in many places, as a speciall meanes to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aile a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the child; <hi>And it shall be well with thee.</hi> Is that all? No. <hi>And with thy seede after thee.</hi> A strong motive to obedience. But still here is a brittle Barke, and it must passe through a tempestuous sea; every little gale tosseth it, a greater indangers it. Pray, that grace (a commodity thou canst not stoo in him) may set him vpright, and keep him so. I say, <hi>pray,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> in another case, oft and againe, that the <hi>keeper of Israell</hi> would so steere him off the Rockes, where there will be ship wracke, as that he may not cause his <hi>Parents Teares:</hi> they will be bitter ones; for I can tell in experience, that one Child is unto the Parents as the two basketts of <hi>Figgs</hi> to the Pallet: when good, very good,
<pb facs="5"/> then sweet, very sweete: he is their <hi>Isaac,</hi> the <hi>Parents ioy.</hi> When bad, very bad; then bitter, very bitter: he is a <hi>Benoni,</hi> all their sorrow: hence <hi>A Mothers Teares.</hi> Beleeue it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Child is a kind of a thing lapt up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like a pretty bundle, thou maist call it a bundle of Cares, but that's to generall: There are three things wrapt closely in it; one, as thou maist be, thou shalt feele before thou see'st it, and that is <hi>Labour</hi> or <hi>Sorrow,</hi> the other comes to thy hand presently, and sticks to it like bird-lime, thou canst not shake thy hands off it; and that is <hi>Care.</hi> The other, which is <hi>Comfort,</hi> thou maist meete with, but thou knowest not when, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, it may slip from thee, thou knowst not how soone; but in place of it, thou shalt be sure to feele the first againe perhaps in more extremitie. God giue thee comfort in thine. Now say as much for mee: And thee thine againe.</p>
