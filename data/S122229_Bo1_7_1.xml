   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccept, J pray you (my deare countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) as thankefully this Pamphlet that J offer vnto you, as louingly it is written for your weale. J would be loath both to be faschious, and fectlesse: And therefore, if it be not senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, at least it is short. Jt may be yee misse many things that yee looke for in it: But for excuse thereof, consider rightly that I onely lay downe herein the trew grounds, to teach you the right-way, without wasting time vpon refuting the aduersaries. And yet I trust, if ye will take narrow tent, ye shall finde most of their great gunnes payed home againe, either with contrary conclusions, or tacite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, suppose in a dairned forme, and indirectly: For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="192" facs="118"/>is to instruct, and not irritat, if J may eschew it. The profite I would wish you to make of it, is, as well so to frame all your actions according to these grounds, as may confirme you in the course of honest and obedient Subiects to your King in all times comming, as also, when ye shall fall in purpose with any that shall praise or excuse the by-past rebellions that brake foorth either in this countrey, or in any other, ye shall herewith bee armed against their Sirene songs, laying their particular examples to the square of these grounds. Whereby yee shall soundly keepe the course of righteous Judgement, decerning wisely of euery action onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie thereof, and not according to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged conceits of the committers: So shall ye, by reaping profit to your selues, turne my paine into pleasure. But least the whole Pamphlet runne out at the gaping mouth of this Preface, if it were any more enlarged; I end, with committing you to God, and me to your charitable censures.</p>
