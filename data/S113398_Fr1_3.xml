we are so vngrounded and vnreasonable, as they imagyn.

   <p>It is a sure and certaine veritie which the Catholik churche alwayes confesseth, that God is in euery place: for so he himself hath<note place="margin">Hierem. 23.</note> avouched, that he filleth both heauen and earth, and therefore there is no place where in he may not be honoured and called vpon.

Which māner of worshipping God (by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages) ended not after wards, for that our Sauiour fore-told the Samaritane that: <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>True, Yea most true was that predictiō, that the Father of heauen should neither be in the former sort adored either in <hi>Garizim</hi> or in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> yet were it very fond to inferre there<note place="margin">M 4. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

And therfore he threatneth to pū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those persons most seuerely▪ that shal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly shed the blood of Man, for that he is the image of God: as yf thereby he would forbid men to abuse, break, and consume his image: and here vpon conclude, the image of God is good, therfore it may be had, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be honoured for his sake.</p>
   <p>The reason of which doctrin (yf thou marke<note place="margin">The ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of al these pointes.</note> wel curteo{us} reader) cōsisteth in these poincts? First, to worship and honour God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as being the Fountaine of all goodnes: then his saincts, for that he hath imparted and deriued vnto them the abundance of his vnspeakeable graces and glorie: &amp; so the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them both are to be worshiped as their representations, and for that they notably apertaine vnto them: and thus consequently Catholiks do very wel if for the honour of God and of his Saincts, they discreetely and
<pb facs="33"/>
orderly loue, and reuerence any thing that concerneth them. Which honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as they may professe with their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, or by their wordes, so may they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the same accordingly and in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by their outward gestures and actions. For which cause they are much to be blamed who blame the deuotions of Catholiks, for honouring the Reliques of Saincts, or such things as belong vnto them, or to their very images. As we see the good deuout Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks here, for the honour they beare to God, to worship his worthie Mother and for her worship, they reuerence her Image: &amp; for the reuerence of her Image, they beare also a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent esteeme of the very wood of the tree wherein the said Image was placed.
