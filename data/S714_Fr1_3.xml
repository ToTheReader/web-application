      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here, good Christiā reader, the paraphrase of Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospel, that is to say, a treasour &amp; in manier a ful library of all good diuinitie bookes. For whatsoeuer thing any of the auncient doctours of the church left behind him, whatsoeuer in any catholike writer is conteined, whatsoeuer any notable good exposytoure hath sette foorthe for the sincere &amp; playne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claracion of the new testament: the pith and substance therof hath this man with a clerkely iudgment compendiously and briefly, as it were in a summe, couched together in this one weorke. Neither was there euer any weorke so easy to be vnderstāded of the reader, which hath more cunning shewed in it, as by his owne annotacions vpon his trāslacion of the new testament it may euidently appere, in which annotacions he approueth &amp; declareth himselfe with such diligent obseruacion and marking to haue perused al libraries, al writers, al bookes: as very few studentes dooe vse to reade and labour any one autour in any one particuler facultie or discipline. Accepte this autour therfore, deuout reader, and with glad wil enbrace so profitable a meane &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumēt, wherby thou maist (without any ferther trauail then onely reading marking, &amp; bearing it away,) so easily attain to the clere vnderstanding of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospel. Reade it with a pure &amp; a charitable hert &amp; with a single iye void of al maner parcialitie of affeccion or of enuy: &amp; thou shalt espy therin such edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as may be mete for thy state of knowlage &amp; aptitude or capacitie, what euel it be. For like as in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most holy &amp; blissed testamēt there is both pappe for yoūg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Accept it willingly &amp; rendre thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes first to God, who of his infinite mercy &amp; grace hath in these our daies sēt such a numbre of suche good writers (and emong them Erasmus as one of the chiefe and principal) not onely to geue clere light, but also to open a way vnto the pure &amp; perfeict knowlage of Gods worde: and than to your moste excellent Soueraine good king Edward the sixte, who emong the other his most princely and most Christian actes, doeth so soone and so effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn first with the promoting of Gods worde and glory, being the fountain and ground of al good successe, welth, and prosperitie: and thirdly to Quene Katerine by whose good meanes and procurement this present weorke hath been by soondry mennes labours turned into our vulgare toung, wherby the kinges Maiestie, (whose principal desire &amp; trauail is to doe all thinges

For a paraphrase is a plain set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of a text or sentence more at large, with such circumstaunce of moe and other wordes, as may make the sentence open, cleare, plaine, &amp; familiar, whiche otherwise should perchaunce seme bare, vnfruitful harde, straunge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

How muche therefore art thou bound deuout christian reader, (and especially ye priestes, and Curates that either haue not ben brought vp in studie of letters &amp; of diuinitie, or els haue not such store of bookes, as may be sufficiēt for mainteining of your studies) how much are al ye bound (I say) vnto the kinges moste exellent Maiestie and his most honorable &amp; worthy Counsaillours, who of a speciall regarde and cōsideracion of the ignoraūce &amp; defaute of litterature (which hath reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in most part of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Clergie of England aswel to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great detriment, harme and decay of religion in the christian flockes to their spiritual charge cōmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as also to their owne intolerable peril and daungier, whan at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day of accoumpt and audite to be made at the throne of God, it shall bee required at their handes how and what they haue taught to the ignoraunt multitude, for whose solles (as touching their institucion in the feith &amp; in the lawes of God) they must answer before a rightful iudge, whome no mā shal be hable to corrupt, beguile deceiue, or escape) haue by their most good poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie founde a meanes, howe both ye and all the people may with a great dele lesse time, study, labour, yea &amp; also charges, then were won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Whatsoeuer ignoraunt person is desirous of knowlage, &amp; can be contēted to learn: whosoeuer is not of an hert so indurate but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he can abide such good bookes, as may further Christes doctrine, whosoeuer is not of an extreme malignaunt stomake against the due setting foorth of Gods worde: whosoeuer is not such an enemie to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> glory of God, that he enuieth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Christes bloud vnto England: whosoeuer is not eyther of such blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that he cannot see the trueth, or of such peruerse &amp; froward malice that he wil not, or of such cancard obstinacie that he wil against the spirite and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his conscience wilfully withstand &amp; resist al good thinges which may induce men to the knowlage of God: whosoeuer doth not hate the light of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospel: whosoeuer is in his herte a fauourer of the trueth, and of the kinges Maiesties most godly procedinges, hath no lesse cause but to enbrace Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, whose doctrine the most &amp; best parte of al Christiā Royalmes &amp; vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities hath euermore allowed &amp; iudged to be consonaūt to the truth, &amp; also is boūd with immortal thankes to pray for the kinges most excellēt Maiestie, for this his most gracious setting forth &amp; publishing this present weorke to the vse of such as haue nede therof. And where the sayd Erasmus fer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then a great nūbre of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scholastical sorte, &amp; other vnlettred expositours
<pb facs="15"/>
of these last blind seasons, hath written these his paraphrases in as ornate a stile as he hath the most parte of hys other volumes: is not (as some barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bloundreers haue for safegard &amp; defence of their owne poore honesties alleged) a thing vnseming for bookes of holy scripture matiers. For diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie like as it loueth no cloking, but loueth to be simple and playn, so doth it not refuse eloquēce, if the same come without iniurie or violacion of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth. For who writeth more ornately then the Greke diuines, Basilius, Gregorie Nazianzene, Theophilactus, Chrisostome? or who in laten more elegauntly than Lactancius▪ Hierome, and diuers others? Albeit in this English para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase the translatours haue of purpose studied rather to write a plain stile, then to vse their elegācie of speche, partely because there cānot in al pointes be expressed in the English tong the grace that is in the laten, much lesse (of my self I speake) the plesauntnesse that is in the stile of Erasmus, a man of moste excell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nt learnyng and exquisite eloquence in this kinde (thoughe in dede not altogether a Ciceronian, but yet feact, pleasaunt, swete, elegaunt, &amp; sensible) &amp; partely because there was a special regarde to be had to the rude and vnlettred people, who perchaunce through default of atteigning to the high stile, should also thereby haue been defrauded of the profit and fruict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of vnderstanding the sence, which thing that they might doe, was the onely pourpose why it was first translated, and now by the kinges most excellent Maiestie willed to be read. For as for the learned are hable enough to helpe themselfes without any translacions at al. Neither are these translacions to be depraued, because some reader would perhaps otherwise haue turned sōe thinges then he shal here rede it. For no two enterpreters there bee, that in translating out of any one tong into an other, would agree in al pointes of stile or enditing, as (best for this purpose) it may appere by the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Churche, whose allegacions of places of holy Scripture, moste commonly varie in wordes, &amp; agree not but in sense. And the same interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that would haue translated some part hereof better thē it now is, would in some other poinctes perchaunce haue doen i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> wurse. Therefore euerie mā ientilly take and interprete an others labours, &amp; beare with his infirmitie, if not in consideracion of his studie &amp; trauail, yet at lestewise for respect of his good zele &amp; godly entente to ferther knowlage. If it come to the handes of suche as can and wil without disdeigne or arrogancie take his penne and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any thing that his good and vncorrupt iudgement shal see mete to be corrected: I suppose that besydes the rewarde of God, &amp; the publique than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of his countrey, he shal also priuatly deserue and receiue immortal thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the translatours, whose desire is to haue it wel. Neither do I suppose any to be of such mind that he would disdeigne or be greued to see his thing bettered, as in this great weorke some thinges are in dede here &amp; there other wise penned, then the firste translatours wrote it. For thys is a common weorke of building, to the which are hired many sondry men of occupacion: and in case some man be making a doore, a windoore, or a frame: though an other of the same occupacion put his hande to the bettering and perfeicting of it, yet is not the so dooyng any displeasure, nor cause of grutche to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but rather a beautifiyng of his dooing▪ &amp; a cause of rendreing thankes to the partie that of good wille and zele without presumpcion, did put hys helping hande to a good purpose. And sembleably in this commō weorke of
<pb n="xv" facs="15"/>
the gospels vineyarde (for asmuch as euery labourer hath his iye directed to the onely marke of setting foorthe the glory of God, and hys moste holy worde,) no man meaneth any rebuke or derogacion to his felow, whan he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth something that was to be refourmed or altered: but rather semeth to craue the like help of the other agayn in his owne doinges, because it is euident that any man can ferther see, and can be a more indifferent iudge in an other mannes doinges, then he can be in his owne. Geuing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firste laude, prayse, and thankes to God for all his giftes, and than to our moste excellent king Edwarde the sixth for so gracious accepting, fauouring, and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning honest and godly studies: leat euery man employ his good talentes that God hath geuen him, to the publique vse of seruing and prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
