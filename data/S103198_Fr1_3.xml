   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any matters (Christian Reader) called into question at this day, are offered to the viewe of the World; and not a fewe of them very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and vnprofitable: but there are also matters which doubtlesse cannot bee denied to bee of singular importance for the furtheraunce of our most holy faith and true Religion. And amongst the waightiest of these, there is almost none of greater vse nor of more necessity to be vnderstood, nor being vnderstood to bee more carefully obserued then this which hereafter ensueth touching the nature and quality of the Lords day commonly called Sunday or the Christian Sabbaoth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, there are diuerse, who (not by reason of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulty in this controuersie, but) being led with the variable conceit of their owne vnsettled minds, do think diuersly: and many such there are who doe speake and wright thereof so loosely, yea so profanely, that if their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions were imbraced among men, there could nothing but Atheisme and irreligious behauiour growe vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and abound. Sundry of these points this Treatise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing doth with great diligence lay open vnto thy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and withall setteth downe plentifully a true and right resolution of this matter. Namely, that the first Day of the weeke (called Sunday, as before sayd) is
<pb facs="6"/> in a peculiar regard, the Lords day, and sanctified to the performing of the solemne worship of GOD, vpon the grounds of Gods Morall or perpetuall lawe in the fourth Commaundement of the Decalogue; And by the speciall will of Christ establishing it through his Apostles prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice &amp; doctrine to the same purpose, instead of the Iewes Sabbaoth. Which Assertion certainly, if it were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and belieued, would make very effectually to the great increase of godlinesse, and to the cutting downe of much sinne and impiety; which euen by meanes of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and neglect hereof doth euery where ouerflowe. The Lord in his good time will dispell the errors and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of vngodly men, and wil aduance in greater bewtie the kingdome of his sonne Christ, by dissoluing the works of Satan, and treading vnder foote all his malice. In the meane while, it behooueth the seruants of God to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant (and nothing slacke) in shewing forth the wisdome of Serpents, aswell as the simplicitie of Doues: That they being wise in the truth, may cause the same to shine among others in these euill dayes; and yet withall in their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie may find fauour not with God alone, but also with men. Reade, trie and holde faste that which is good: and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things. <hi>Farewel.</hi>
