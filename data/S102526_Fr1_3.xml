<pb facs="5"/> other bodyly exercises: And on the other side, how few there be in the world that will either abate their sleepe, for-goe their pleasures, abridge their dyets, or seeke after the spirituall Physition or prepare physick to purge and expell those dangerous &amp; peccant humors, of notorious and hainous sinnes, which in time will both breed and bring foorth the most deadly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of Desperation, the very Peste of soule and body for euer.</p>
   <p>It is a wonder to see,<note place="margin">The third thing to be wondred at.</note> how many abhor, and are afraide of worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and for the auoyding thereof, and for the loue and liking of transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie riches, will with great carke and care rise vp early, and late take their rest: they will fare hardly, and go clad full barely: they will hazard both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and soules; they will toyle and teare their flesh in vnmeasurable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures by land and sea, be the weather faire, be it foule, <hi>per mare pauperiem fugientes, per saxa, perignes:</hi> And yet
<pb facs="6"/> on the other side, how few can abide any costes, charges, or paines, to escape and remedie spirituall decayes: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde pouertie of conscience, or in time before it be too late, to beware that they be not plunged ere they be aware into the most deadly and diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish gulph of Desperation; as though saluation, and peace of a godly consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were a matter not worthy the talking of, or labouring for.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">A thing to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>It is a lamentable thing to behold, how many in the world will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and attempt any thing, be it neuer so chargeable and troublesome, not sluggish not sleepie; not carelesse and slouthfull, but most earnest &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, most carefull &amp; painefull, at euery assay; by prudence and prowesse, by witte and by warinesse, by counsaile and by cunning, by learning and by labouring; ambitiously to hunt, gaine, and gape after honour, and vnfatigab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye seeke to attaine fame, and highly account of it to be gazed on, and talked
<pb facs="6"/> of, with the eyes &amp; tongues of all men: And againe, how few take any cate at all, or once endeuour themselues to auoyde shame, and confusion in the presence of the Almightie, to become glorious in the sight of God and his Angels, and to vse and exercise any of those good meanes and instrumentes ordeyned and appoynted of God for the increase of Fayth, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and for the weakning and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of all desperation &amp; diffidence in Gods infinite mercies, and infallible promises.</p>
   <p>It is a lamentable thing to marke and consider how vigilant, carefull,<note place="margin">The second thing to be lamented.</note> &amp; heedfull many of the wyser, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecter sort of men of this world will be to escape, and auoyde, all the penalties, paynes, and punishmentes, prouided and set downe, for offenders of mortall mens lawes; how painefull they will be in Penall Statutes, &amp; how skilfull in euery braunch of the Ciuill Lawes, least they should ignorantly
<pb facs="7"/> incurre the dangers of imprisonment, of losse of landes, forfeytures of their goodes, or death it selfe.</p>

         </gap>hen of Gods lawes.</note>But the mightie God, the only high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Law-giuer, that Lord of Lordes, and King of all Kinges; Let him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne, publish, and proclayme his Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinaunces, to be harkened vnto, obserued, and kept, and that vnder neuer so rigorous and seueere conditions, punishmentes, and penalties, How few men will search his Booke of Statutes and Lawes?

      </gap> thankfully embrace his couenant of Reconciliation, set foorth in his most ioyfull, and comfortable Gospell?</p>
   <p>And yet most certaine it is, that all these aforesayd thinges, so much to be wondred at, and so greatly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for; so lightly looked on, so
<pb facs="7"/> smally regarded, and so little thought on, &amp; many such other of the like fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie &amp; order of disorders, &amp; sinnes, being delighted in, and securely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, without all care or indeuour to forsake them in time, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and true returning to the Lord, do first breed and ingender, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes bring foorth Desperation; then the which, all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uries, and Diuels in hell, can not lightly excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate nor finde out a greater torment, or a more intollerable paine, and that because that all other tormentes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and paines, are but temporall, and pursue men no further then bodily death: but this endeth not with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death, but becommeth eternall. Whosoeuer then he be, that is once surely catcht in this nette of Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee needes no moe accusers to come against him, then his former vnrepented sinnes, which lye at the doore to arrest him; his owne heart will giue euidence against him, and
<pb facs="8"/> his owne iniquitie will plead him to be guiltie, and that to his owne face.</p>
   <p>Vpon consideration of these things, I haue now in this Treatise following, (good Christian Reader) endeuoured my selfe to set downe, First, a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Desperation;</hi> then the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnesse thereof: after this, certaine principall causes thereof; togeather with remedies for the same: and lastly, a generall Preseruatiue against <hi>Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> arysing of what cause so euer: To the intent, that the children of God, falling by some occasions into some degrees of it, (for if it rage in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, in the opinion of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writers, it is an euill incurable, and vnrecouerable) may with the more ease and quietnesse be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and saued as it were out of the Diuels clawes; euen out of as great danger as euer was the poore Sheepe that <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke out of the Beares or Lions mouth.<note place="margin">1. Sam 17.34 35.</note>
   </p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>Accept hereof (gentle Reader) with no worse a minde, then I haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the writer; and then I doubt not, but it shall either minister vnto thine heart some comfortable Phisicke, or els giue thee occasion to seeke, reade, or collect a better.</p>
