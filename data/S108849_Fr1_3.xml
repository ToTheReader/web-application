   <head>THE TRANSLATORS <hi>PREFACE, IN DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Prayers of this Booke, to the Saints of God in Heauen.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>GEntle Reader, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou bee; This Booke is so fit for thee, that I doubt not thou wilt con mee thanke for hauing taught it to speake English. For if thou frequent the vse and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of it, it will teach thee the language of Heauen. Wherein whensoeuer thou speakest to GOD and his Saints, they will answer thee: and whatsoeuer thou demaundest of them, they cannot deny thee. And though fearefully reading here &amp; there a little, thou shouldst only take
<pb facs="5"/> it in thy handes to sipp thereof, as men are wont to doe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, when they intend no more but to taste it: yet it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that the lippes and the hands of thy soule, which are thy will &amp; thy vnderstanding, should not receiue some Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and retaine some taste of the sweetnesse of it.</p>

      </gap>t because, it may so fall out with thee, that hauing been brought vp as it were in some defiance with the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and thereby thinking all honor too much which is done them, and euery request to bee no lesse then Idolat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/> either to detest, or cōtemne the Booke it selfe; I haue thought good, to set thee downe two wayes; how thou mayst both read, and vse the foresaid pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: not onely without scruple and offence of conscience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of thine owne Masters, which is the first way: but also according to the profession of Ours, with great delight, &amp; true spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; which is the other.</p>
   <p>The first is (supposing thou canst not thinke better) to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, all the Prayers of this Booke to the Saints of heauen to be but a figure of Rethorick, called <hi>Apostrophe;</hi> or which is all one, a fayned speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to excite affectiō made vnto those thinges w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> cannot heare vs; as to a Rocke, to a Riuer; to Birds or Beasts. For in such
<pb facs="6"/> figuratiue senses, the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors of thine owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, do vnderstand those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable prayers to Saints, which euery where they reade in the holy Fathers; &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will here yeeld thee some few examples in their speeches alone to our Blessed Lady.</p>

Hayle full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; Blessed doe all the holy Quires of men and Angels call thee; Blessed art thou among women, &amp; Blessed is the fruit of thy wombe. Mistris, and Lady, &amp; Queene, and Mother of God, make intercession for vs.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>St. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who liued in the same age, &amp; was of such fame,<note place="margin">Ephraim</note> that in some Churches after the Scripture, his writinges were publickly read, &amp; whose pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers most patheticall to our B. Lady, in his Sermō of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the most holy Mother of God, and in diuers other places are too long to be recited; in a proper Prayer to our B. Lady.
<pb facs="7"/> among other things he saith as followeth. <hi>Bee present with me mercifull, Clement, and Benigne Virgin, especially in this present life; feruently protecting me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the assaults of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Conducting mee to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>y death, preseruing my miserable soule: driuing away the darkesome visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wicked Spirits; deliuering mee in the terrible day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from eternall Damnation: and lastly making me heyre of the inaccessible glory of God thy Son. Which I beseech thee againe, and againe, most holy Lady and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, that I may obtaine by thy intercession and fauour, through the grace and mercy, and humanitie of thy onely begotten Soone our Lord and God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ.</hi>

      <hi>which they receiued from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the same they deliuered to their children.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now therefore my friend, if
<pb facs="8"/> these speeches of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy Fathers to our blessed Lady be lawfull, certainly there is no prayer of this book as made to Saints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, for if they be not lawful as prayers, they bee lawfull as <hi>Apostrophes.</hi> And if thy stomack rise not against these wordes of the Fathers, no reason it should detest the like speeches of ours. And if these may faynedly be vsed to exite affection, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also may be likewise pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised to inflame our deuotion.</p>
   <p>Wherfore, if thou canst frame thy conscience to beleeue, that all these prayers and the like, are nothing else but fayned speches; this will be one way, according to the doctrine of thine owne masters, not onely to serue thy selfe, but also to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie others, that shall obiecte the reading of this Booke, or
<pb facs="9"/> the practise thereof vnto thee. But if according to truth and reason, thou be so perswaded, that neither wee, nor the holy Fathers, either doe, or may vse such <hi>figmatiue</hi> or fayned pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; it will import thee, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the other way, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with vs, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally spoken vnto the Saints; not as vnto walles and woods, but as vnto those, that verily heare vs, and are able to help vs.</p>
   <p>And therefore, because I do not thinke thou wilt easily cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the holy Fathers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, wherein no ignorance can excuse their damnation: but rather will desire some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction in this point according to the Scripture, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thy Masters would seeme to make the onely ground of their Religiō: That I may the better
<pb facs="9"/> content thee, I will set thee down here in this Preface, such euident proofes out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for prayer to Saintes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> may be sufficient, not onely to quiet thy own minde: but also to conuince the most learned Protestant, that hereafter shall attempt to speake against it.</p>
   <p>But before I begin, I desire to informe thee of 4. short perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers; wherof the two first are such, as may suffice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alone to resolue this question.</p>
   <p>The first is, that many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Protestants, haue agreed with vs in this point. For the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> in his owne words was this that followeth.<note place="margin">Luther in purgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quorū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum.</note>
      <hi>Of intercession of Saints, I thinke and iudge with the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, that the Saints are to bee honoured by vs, and also to be
<pb facs="10"/> inuocated.</hi> With whom doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note n="a" place="margin">acts &amp; mon: pag 462.</note>
      <hi>Bilnay,</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">acts and mon pag 1312.</note>
      <hi>Latimer,</hi> canonized Martyrs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Calender. Wherefore this being the beleefe, not only of their first Apostle; but also of their latter Martyrs; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, how it may stand with the reputation of a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Protestant, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn vs, or to mislike vs for it.</p>
   <p>The second perticuler which I would haue thee well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, is this; That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground whereon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants doe especially build their deniall, or rather their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of this Doctrine, is most vaine and friuolous; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, Inuocation of Saints to be altogether vnlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is no where expresly commaunded or approued in holy Scripture. For, I wold but
<pb facs="10"/> aske a Protestant, where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Hunting, or Hawking to be expresly commanded, or cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Word of God? which, vnlesse he loue Hawkes and Dogs, better then Saints or Angels, were enough to make him see, the impertinencie of this position. In a word, I will demaund, where he findeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Assertion it self, which they make the ground of their beleife; to bee expresly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or (to giue instance in some other particulers) where he can shew me, The eating of Blood and strangled meat: the celebration of Christmas, and of the Feastes of the Apostles: the vse of Surplisse, Cappe, and Typpet in the seruice of Christ: Or in fine, The abrogation of the Iewes Saboth, which is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, to be expresly either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
<pb facs="11"/> or approoued in holy writ? Which, not being able to performe, he not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth himselfe in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practise of all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers, if hee stand to his owne ground: but also maketh the Ground it selfe, to ouerthrow it selfe, as being no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly taught in holy Scripture. Wherfore, though no laudable example of prayer to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, could be found in the written Word: yet this is no sufficient cause to cōdemne it. From whence also it foloweth; That vnlesse y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Protestants can shew (which they will neuer be able to doe) that prayer to Saints is euidently forbidden, either by the word of God, or light of nature, or lawe of the Church; They can neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended or excused, from great
<pb facs="11"/> impietie and damnable scisme, in deuiding them selues, not only from the Catholicke bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: but also from the Saints themselues by this occasion.</p>
   <p>Thirdly therefore, to come nerer the question in hand, that we dispute not of wordes, but of the matter it selfe, now in controuersie betwene thee and me; Thou must vnderstand, that the worde Prayer, is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for a request made vnto him, whom we honour as the first omnipotent cause, and infinite Author of all thinges. Secondly, for a petition made vnto those, whom we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be indued with that excellencie, which is only foūd in the friends of God that are in heauen: and lastly, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest made vnto any other, with that respect, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="12"/> to bee due vnto those, that haue the meanes to helpe vs. In the first &amp; second sense, this word is vsed, when we are said to pray, or to make our prayer vnto another: in the last sense, when wee pray our friends or our betters to doe this, or y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> for vs; For although we pray them; yet wee are not properly said to pray, or to make our prayer vnto them. By Prayer to Saincts therefore, we vnderstand a request made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, not with that worship which is due vnto God, as the Author of all things: but with that honour and reuerence w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is due to the Saints of God aboue all other Creatures. And in this sense the Protestants thēselues will graunt, That if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make any request vnto them, it ought to be done with
<pb facs="12"/> that reuerence which is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; &amp; by consequence, that in this sense, it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray them (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at all) but also to pray vnto them.</p>
   <p>Lastly, to the end that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be taken against the proofes that follow, as not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently deliuered according to my promise out of Scripture, thou must consider that two māner of wayes a thing may be proued out of Scripture. First, by the expresse wordes thereof in which manner we proue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. As for example, <hi>That man is iustified by workes and not</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 24 Iohn 20▪ 22. 23. Math. 26<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> 27.</note>
      <hi>by Faith alone;</hi> That Priests <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Holy Ghost to forgiue sinnes;</hi> That the Blessed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the body &amp; blood of Christ</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> 14.</note> and the like. But in this māner
<pb facs="13"/> the Protestants cannot direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, any one point of their Religion against vs. Therfore no reason that in all points, they should exact this kinde of proofe at our hands. Secondly a thing may bee prooued by Scripture, as following by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence out of scripture, which kind of proofe and no other the Protestants (though failing therein no lesse then in the former) pretend to be the very ground of their Faith, in those points wherein they differ from vs; And after this manner, I intend to make it euident that prayer to Saints may bee lawfully vsed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures.</p>

      <p>Supposing the Creed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to bee the infallible worde of GOD, and if not Scripture, yet certainly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture; I prooue the lawfulnesse or rather necessitie of prayer to Saints, out of our Beliefe of the Communion of Saints. Which doubtlesse for this cause among other reasons it hath pleased God, to make an Article of our Creede, to
<pb facs="18"/> excite vs so much the more thereby to this kinde of pyous worship &amp; inuocation of them. For if sinfull men on earth, are truely vnderstood, to bee here comprehended vnder the name of Saints: much lesse may the Blessed soules of Heauen, be here excluded from that tytle. And who can imagine that the Soules of the iust, are seperated by death, from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church wherein they liued? For as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, why doe they run so fast to the Sacrament of Baptisme in extreame danger of death, that were neuer in the Church before? Or why doe they make such hast to be reconciled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto before they dye, that are deuided from it? vnlesse it be to inioy after death, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it? Wherefore, I do
<pb facs="18"/> not see, how we can beleeue, that there is one Communion of the Saints in heauen, and the Saints on earth according to our Creed: except we beleeue a Communion, or which is all one, a <hi>Communication</hi> of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall offices betweene them; wee praying to them, and they praying for vs: the greater hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the lesse, and the lesse in all their necessities, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto the greater.</p>

      <head>THE <hi>THIRD ARGVMENT,</hi>
      </head>
      <p>Is also in explication and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the former. And supposing that if it be lawfull to pray the Saints of Heauen, it is no lesse lawfull to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as I haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the third consideration; It may be framed in this māner.
<pb facs="19"/> It is lawfull to recommend our wants by way of prayer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie, vnto all the friends of God, that are desirous to heare vs and are able to helpe vs in perticuler. But such are all the Saints of Heauen; Therefore it is lawfull in such manner to commend our selues, and our wants vnto them.</p>
      <p>The Maior is so euident, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the light of Nature, that there needeth no Scripture to confirme it. For as now at this day, so no doubt before the Scripture was written, it was lawfull for the childe to recō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himselfe, vnto the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Father, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy man, because it was beleeued, that such kinde of men, were able and willing to helpe them by their prayers. And the onely reason of any
<pb facs="19"/> waight, which the Protestants alleadge for their not praying to Saints, is especially this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thinke the Saints of heauen doe not heare them; Wherefore if they heare and can and will helpe vs, there is no further doubt, but that wee may pray and beseech them to relieue vs.</p>
      <p>The Minor therefore, that the Saints in Heauen are most desirous, and likewise most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to heare and helpe vs, is prooued first, a <hi>Posteriore,</hi> or from the effect: and secondly a <hi>Priore,</hi> or from the cause: a <hi>Posteriore,</hi> thus; They doe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually present or recōmend our prayers vnto God; <hi>The foure</hi>

         </note>
         <hi>Beasts, and the 24. Elders, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing golden vialls full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints.</hi> Therefore they not onely know
<pb facs="20"/> our prayers in perticuler (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou wilt imagine, that they Offer them sealed vp in a Bag, as ignorant of that which is contained in them) but also are a meane to God for vs, and helpe vs to obtaine them.</p>
      <p>The same is also prooued a <hi>Priore</hi> three manner of waies.</p>
      <p>And first, by the perfit loue and charitie, which is between the Saints in heauen, and their brethren here on earth. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Charitas nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam excidit,</hi> Charitie (which is the loue of God and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) neuer falleth away, but remaineth with his Saints for euer. And the reason thereof is manifest. For, louing God so perfitly as they doe, they must needes loue all those, whom they know to bee so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of him, as that he gaue
<pb facs="20"/> his onely Son to redeem them. This therefore being supposed out of Scripture, and the Minor consisting of two parts; The first, that the Saints of heauen, desire to heare and helpe vs, And the second, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe both the one &amp; the other. The first part I proue by the latter, in this manner: The Saints of God desire it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot want y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> means to performe it.</p>
      <p>That they desire it, is proued first out of the Nature of all true loue in generall. For the which you must vnderstand, That <hi>Loue</hi> being the first act of the <hi>Will:</hi> and the <hi>formall</hi> obiect of both the act, and power of the will, beeing that which is good; to loue another, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to <hi>will</hi> him that which is good, especially for
<pb facs="21"/> this reason, because it is good vnto him. So that, the finall and formal cause of true loue, being the good of another; To loue one truly, is to wish him all the good that may be; and to loue very much, is to <hi>will,</hi> or to wish the same very much vnto him.</p>
      <p>And because it is the Nature of the will, and by consequence of loue, to doe that which it willeth, vnlesse it be hindered, Therefore it produceth in vs, not onely a desire to heare and vnderstand, the good and euill of the partie beloued: but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs likewise by all the meanes wee can, to prosecute the one, and to auoyde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the which cause, loue is said to bee more effectuall then affectuall; <hi>Plus enim facit quam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>fficat,</hi> and according to Saint <hi>Gregorie, Probatio amonis
<pb facs="21"/> est exhibitio operis.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Loue without these acts and fruits of loue, is worse then the Fig-tree which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cursed, and is indeed no loue at all.</p>
      <p>From whence also it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that albeit wee may loue those whom we know not in perticuler, as belonging to such an One, or as the parts of such a Communitie which is principally beloued of vs, and may content our selues with that generall good which we are able to doe them: yet if our loue be perfit it is impossible we should not desire to know them, and to doe for them also in perticuler if we be able, or if our attendance to the perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler knowledge and seruice of them, do not hinder some grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, which otherwise we
<pb facs="22"/> might performe in generall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. By which it is manifest, that either the Saints in heauen desire to heare vs, &amp; to releiue vs, not onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but also in perticuler when we call vpon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one in them can be no hinderance to the other: Or else it must needs be granted, that they doe not loue vs. For that without this desire, it is very plaine they care not for vs.</p>
      <p>I know some Protestants do here obiect against this perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer care, the same which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Atheists haue also obiected against the prouidence of God; Affirming that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Caluin. instit: lib. 3. cap: 20 per. 24</note> cannot giue eare to our Prayers, or attend to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without some trouble and impeachment to their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. But the Protestants gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="22"/> as they doe, that this is no trouble at all, neither to the person of God, nor to the soule of Christ, nor to the Angels themselues (<hi>Psal. 90. 11. Dan. 10. 13. Zac. 1. 12. Math. 18. 10 Lue. 15. 10. Acts. 12. 15. Apoc.</hi> 8. 3.) make this Obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Saints of God, with lesse reason and more malice, then it was made by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters before them against God himselfe.</p>
      <p>Secondly therfore, this desire of theirs will yet better appeare by the consideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Charitie in perticuler.</p>
      <p>For according to that, which hath bene said, as to loue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to will the good, and by consequence the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is also the reason that a wicked man, because he willeth not his owne good, as
<pb facs="23"/> he is wicked, can neuer be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued: so to loue God, is nothing else, but to will, the will of God; and therefore in effect to desire that it may be perfitly fulfilled, both in our selues, &amp; in all other Creatures.</p>
      <p>And because, as the Apostle speaketh <hi>This is the will of God,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Thes: 4. 3</note>
         <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </gap>fication,</hi> or which is all one, the saluation of our selues and others. Therefore to loue God about all thinges, wherin consisteth the nature of all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, includeth a will to attend aboue all other thinges vnto the sanctification &amp; saluation, first of our selues, and secondly of all our Brethren. Now then to goe forward, as nothing is desired, but that which is good: so the greater the good is, if it be well knowne and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the more it is desired; And
<pb facs="23"/> therfore, as there is nothing so good as the will of God: so nothing by many degrees can bee so much desired, of those that truely loue God, as that his will be most perfitly fulfilled, in the sanctification and saluation of all men.</p>
      <p>Againe, as the will of God himself is the end of all things: so the loue of his will, and the desire of dooing thereof, is the end of all other loues, and all other desires. And therefore, as God himselfe hath ordained, so it must needs bee, that our loue of his will, and desire to fulfill the same, if our loue be right, doe exceede with like proportion all other worldly loues or desires whatsoeuer.</p>
      <p>Wherefore to conclude this point; if true loue in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, not onely of grace,
<pb facs="24"/> but also of Nature, produceth in vs a perpetuall and constant desire, not onely to heare and vnderstand, the good and euill of the parties beloued: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to endeauour by all good meanes and courses to releeue them; how great must the floud and Torrent bee of that desire, which floweth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the highest degree, from the Fountaine and sowrse of all loue, which is God himselfe, into the Soules of the Saints of heauen, to complie, and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with his eternall will, by all the meanes they can, in the sanctification and saluation of others.</p>
      <p>And if the zeale of men on earth, not onely in the time of grace: but also vnder the dead letter of the Law, extend it selfe with such desire, not only
<pb facs="24"/> to heare and vnderstand, but also to succour and redresse by their daily prayers, infinit dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp; continuall labours and miseries of their brethren; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing both Sea and Land (as our Sauiour saith) <hi>to make one</hi>
         <note place="margin">Math, 23 15,</note>
         <hi>Proselite,</hi> or to conuert one soule vnto Christ; how much more doth the inflamed chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Saints in heauen, transforme their soules into the like desire?</p>
      <p>And admiring so much as wee doe, the vehement loue of <hi>Moyses,</hi> and zeale of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> while they liued amongst men, to their Naturall brethren the<note place="margin">Exod. 32 32.</note>
         <hi>Iewes;</hi> not refusing <hi>to bee struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Booke of life,</hi> and to bee <hi>made an Athema,</hi> if need<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3</note> should be for their saluation; How wonderfull and vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable thinke you, is the desire
<pb facs="25"/> of the Saints of heauen, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the saluation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren here on earth? and how effectuall to recommend their perticuler prayers, which here euen in this world, is the least, and most easie office, that one friend can do for an other? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this desire in these gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vials, must needs so farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the former in those earthē vessels, as the easines of the one exceedeth the difficultie of the other; And as their knowledge and loue of God whome now they see, exceedeth the obscure knowledge which they had of him, and their imperfect loue towards him when they could not beholde him.</p>
      <p>Adde vnto all this, that the felictie of the Saints of heauen, is much increased and perfited, by the saluation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb facs="25"/> on earth. And therfore, as much as they desire y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> perfectiō of their owne felicitie, they can no lesse desire to receiue, and to recommend our prayers vnto <hi>God;</hi> w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they know to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest meanes both on our parts and theirs wherby to obtain it.</p>
      <p>Thus, as I take it-hauing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed how exceedingly the Saints desire both to heare and helpe vs in our necessities, according to that superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their loue and charitie towards vs, which passeth all humane vnderstanding; let vs now cōsider whether it follow hereof, that they are able to doe those good Offices for vs, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they so much desire. Which is easily proued as followeth.</p>
      <p>Whensoeuer Almighty God giueth a <hi>Loue,</hi> an <hi>Inclination,</hi> or <hi>Desire</hi> to any thing, hee giueth
<pb facs="26"/> also some power and abilitie to obtaine the same. As we see in the desires and inclinations of all Naturall thinges. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the inclination of the Elements to their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: in the Appetite of Birdes and Beasts, to those things that are necessarie for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Nature: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all the Naturall propenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and desires of Man. And the reason thereof is euident. For Almightie God hauing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the one to obtaine the other; and desire of it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not sufficient to procure the thing desired, hee should come short of his purpose, working in vaine, and leauing his worke vnperfit, like vnto him in the Gospell, <hi>Qui cepit aedifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore, this being true, and a generall rule in all his works vpon earth; how much more is it also true, and a certaine rule in Heauen, where all appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are satisfied, and all desires fulfilled? And hauing giuen the very possession and fruition of himselfe, and of his Sonne Christ Iesus, to reward his Saints; how, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith together with himselfe, <hi>Will hee not giue them all thinges,</hi> which their hearts can desire?

And as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, <hi>If hee were not able to</hi>
         <note place="margin">Gen. 28, 27.</note>
         <hi>conceale from Abraham</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which he intended, against the wicked Citty of <hi>Sodom,</hi> to the end, that by <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayers he might pardon them if it were possible, according to the ordinary Law of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence: and whereby also as it is probable, his cosen <hi>Lot</hi> was saued from that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fire; how can hee conceale from his friends in Heauen the good, or euill which hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to their brethren? to the end that by their prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="27"/> bringing all thinges to passe by Ordinary meanes, hee may conferre the one, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the other?</p>
      <p>Whereby it appeareth how vaine it is, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants doe here obiect, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Saints haue no eares they cannot heare vs. For albeit they haue no corporall Organ of hearing; yet Almighty God is not so poore of power, but that hee may easily prouide them of other meanes, For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels, nor the Deuils haue eares; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Protestants will not deny; that they haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to heare our wordes when we speake; or which in them is all one, to vnderstand our meaning. Neither doth the want of an eare, make this kind of hearing the worse, but rather
<pb facs="28"/> much the better. For beeing thereby freed from all those conditions and circumstances, which limit and contract the corporall passion and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sence of hearing, to place and distance, &amp;c: no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be giuen, but that they may heare as well a farre off, as nere at hand; yea, our thoghts aswell as our wordes, when we are willing to haue thē known vnto them. For in this manner and no otherwise are we able to conceiue, how one Angell or Deuill should naturally heare or vnderstand another. Why then will the Protestants deny that power to any Saint in Heauen, which they know to be no more then is giuen to the Deuill?</p>
      <p>And truely though they had no meanes at all to heare our
<pb facs="28"/> prayers immediately &amp; direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they come frō our selues; yet they might easily know them, because as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, they haue the meanes to see them. And if <hi>Elizeus, while</hi>

         <hi>sayest in thy Booke, that while we line, wee may pray for each other; but after wee are dead, no mans prayer can bee heard for another: especially when the Martyrs pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue their blood reuenged, were not able to obtain it.</hi> Which reason of the Hereticke was most false; for their request was not denyed, but onely a
<pb facs="30"/> little delayed for the good of their Brethren. But heare what St. <hi>Hierome</hi> answereth; <hi>If the Apostles and Martyrs while they were in their Bodyes could pray for others, when it imported them to bee carefull of themselues; how much more after their victorious Crownes and Tryumphs? Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being but one, obtayned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God for sixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Armed men; And shall hee bee of lesse force, beeing now with Christ in Heauen? Paul</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>That 270. soules in the Ship with him, were giuen vnto him: And after his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when hee began to bee with Christ, must he shut vp his mouth and not be able, to speake so much as one halfe worde, for those, who through the world haue beleeued his Gospell?</hi> Shall <hi>Vigillantius, this liuing Dog, bee better then
<pb facs="30"/> hee that dead Lyon? For to this purpose, I might wel vse the words of the Preacher; If I beleeued Saint Paul to bee dead in spirit, the Saints are not said to be dead, but</hi> (to wit according to the body) <hi>sleeping or reposing.</hi> Thus Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Secondly therefore (to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) The willingnesse and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Saints in Heauen to heare and assist vs, is proued out of those Scriptures, which teach vs, that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the Saints on earth, are all Brethren of the same <hi>family,</hi> and <hi>Domesticals of God; hauing all receiued the adoption</hi>
         <note place="margin">Ephes: 19. Gal: 4 Ephe, 4 Gal. 4. Heb. 1 23.</note>
         <hi>of the Sonnes of God, and beeing all fellow members of the same Body, and Cittizens of the same Citty, which is the heauenly Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem our Mother, the Church of the first borne, including the
<pb facs="31"/> societie of many thousand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Which being supposed, wee may argue in this manner. In euery Mysticall body or socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the principall and more perfite members, haue power and abilitie more or lesse to helpe and assist the rest that are more imperfit, according to their particuler necessities. For this is the end of all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and therefore so true, that no citty or kingdome, or ciuill Body can stand without it. But the Saints in Heauen, are the principall partes of this Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body; Therefore it must needes follow, that they haue some kinde of meanes to heare and to helpe vs in perticuler, when wee call vpon them. For otherwise, they could neither make one Family, nor one citty
<pb facs="31"/> nor one Body with vs, which is directly against the Scriptures here before alleadged.</p>
      <p>Againe, in euery Societie, those members that are out of daunger and in prosperitie, are bound in duty to succour those that are in any great danger or necessitie, especially when it greatly concerneth the good of the whole Body. But such are the Saints of heauen, and such is the case between vs and them, especially when we finde our selues assaulted with some grieuous affliction, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Temptation in perticuler; Therefore according to their power, when such occasions happen, they are bound as may be said in duty to releeue vs. <hi>Hee</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn) that shall haue the Substance of this world, and shall see his Brother haue
<pb facs="32"/> neede, and shall shut his Bowels from him; how doth the Charitie of God abide in him?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Saints of God, <hi>hauing the substance</hi> of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other world: and possessing the Treasures of all Graces, wee must either fowly condemne them, for want of <hi>Charity;</hi> or else, wee must needs graunt, that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>their Bowels</hi> to releeue the necessities of their distressed brethren. And truely Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, seeing the want of this power in his Saints to help vs (if it were so as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants would haue it) and the Saints againe seeing our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or if they doe not, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not; how may it be thought, that either God himselfe can shut the Bowels of his Charitie from them, when they aske the one: or
<pb facs="32"/> they from vs, when we call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be releeued in the other? Wherfore to conclude this second reason, for the proofe of their Power to helpe vs; consider gentle Reader, whether it can stand, either with the vnitie of this mysticall body, that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen should not haue it: or with their Obligation not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it: or with their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not to inioy it: or with Gods goodnesse not to graunt it.</p>
      <p>Thirdly and lastly then, this willingnes and power of theirs is yet further proued, by their speciall Patronage and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of vs; for the one doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently include the other, and no man can imagine, how they can be truely said to guide and defend vs, who like the Idols
<pb facs="33"/> of the Gentiles, are neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare vs nor to helpe vs. Wherefore, their Pastorall care and protection ouer vs is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, first, by reason grounded vpon Scripture, and secondly, by the Scripture it selfe. And the first reason thereof, may be framed in this manner. In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ordered Body or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, the members which are the most potent pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and perfit, are appointed to gouerne and protect the rest. But the Saints of heauen make one body with vs, as hath bene proued by the expresse word of God; Therefore, as being the most sufficient Members thereof, they must be Ordained by God to gouerne and direct vs. According whereu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And although they assist Almightie God, not onely in his Diuine mercyes, but also in his punishments: yet they serue themselues more of the mildnesse, then of the furie of the Lambe, whome they followe wheresoeuer hee goeth.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Whereunto may bee added another reason, For hee that will contemplate a little, shall easily finde, that Almightie God, seldome or neuer doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing by himselfe alone, which may be brought to passe by meanes of those his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="34"/> that are apt to be made the instruments of his Diuine power. Not that hee hath any neede of them, but because it belongeth to his glory &amp; their perfection, as much as may be, to be serued of them. Which is not onely seene in the visible preseruation of this world, all thinges depending therein of more inferiour causes: but also confessed in the inuisible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and Gouernours thereof, his holy Angels. Who are therefore, in generall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring Spirits,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14</note> testified among other<note place="margin">Num. 20 16.</note> thinges, to haue had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Isralites,</hi> out of<note place="margin">Exod. 23 20.</note> Aegypt, and in the person of God, to haue giuen the Law it<note place="margin">Act. 7. 30 35. 53.</note> selfe vnto them.</p>
      <p>Wherefore the Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="34"/> being so much more fit to gouerne and protect vs, then the Angels: by how much they are nearer vnto vs both by Grace and Nature, and through their owne experience of our fragilitie, haue better learned to take compassion of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie: It cannot stand with the sweetnesse of Gods proul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to exclude them from the Patronage and protection of vs. For the which hee hath made them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o fit, and which many of them haue so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, not only by their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards vs, but also by their good gouernment of vs, while yet they liued heere amongst vs.</p>
      <p>For further proofe whereof, it is not hard to alledge many good passages, and pregnant places of holy Scripture. For
<pb facs="35"/> so our Sauiour promised, <hi>That the faithfull seruant, should bee</hi>

      <p>It is so naturall for men in affliction to call vpon all those that are able to help them, though meerly stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnto them, &amp; the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes thereof is so euident, euen by the light of reason, that it would seeme a point

      <p>This is also confirmed by the practise of the Church in the time of <hi>Iob,</hi> vnto whome one of his three friendes spake as followeth: <hi>Call, if there bee any that will answer thee, and turne thee to some one of the Saints.</hi> Where by name of Saints, Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth<note place="margin">S.

      <p>The second paritie, It is lawfull to pray to Saints that are liuing; Therefore, it is lawfull to pray vnto the Saints that are departed. The consequence is proued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Almightie GOD, is no more dishonoured by the

         <pb facs="46"/> him selfe, who in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmacion of this verie point of prayer to Saints, which he preached against the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes of his time that spake against it; Blessed certaine bread which the people off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Signe of the Crosse, and said; <hi>In this you shall knowe, that those thinges are true which we haue Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched If all your sicke, hauing tasted of this Bread, shall be restored to their former health,</hi> And when the Bishop there had said, <hi>If they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
               <desc>••</desc>
            </gap>iue it with a good faith they shalbe healed;</hi> Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> added, I doe not say so, <hi>but assuredly who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap> taste it, shall be healed, to the end they may knowe that we are true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers sent from God.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, a huge multitude of
<pb facs="46"/>
         <hi>sicke folkes</hi> hauing tasted that Bread recouered, that this worde <hi>was diuulged</hi> ouer all the Prouince.</p>
      <p>To conclude, in all the places likewise before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, those venerable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Authors haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so many Miracles in this poynt of prayers to Saintes, as if any Protestant would take the paines, either to read them, or to heare them reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would be more then sufficient to conuince him, For he that should deride or contemne the iudgements of those famous Saints, were verye prophane; And how can he think himselfe a good Christian, that will giue no credit or beliefe to the chiefe Pastors and Doctors of the Church of Christ? whome
<pb facs="47"/> shall we belieue; if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue not them? Were not this to take away all faith, and together therewith all Morall beliefe out of the worde?</p>
      <p>And this shall suffice me (Curteous Reader) to haue collected for the most part out of other Catholicke Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for thy satisfaction in this point of praier to Saints drawne by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence out of the Text it selfe of holy scripture, which the Protestants on the other side haue neither heretofore nor euer will be able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer hereafter; and much lesse to produce any solide Argument out of Scripture, for the proofe of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: without the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, though we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
<pb facs="47"/> no proofe at all, it were more then absurde to condemne any generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome or practise of Church or Common wealth; as hath bene noted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
      <p>Wherefore gentle freind now at the length to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this whole discourse; if thou rest satisfied therwith I shall think my labour well bestowed: but neither will I think it lost, if I may gaine so much of thee, as not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to venture thy Soule, with the auncient Fathers, vppon a truth so testified, not onely by the worde of God in Scripture: but also with the very hand of God in Signes and Miracles, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well at this present time, as in all former ages; thou
<pb facs="48"/> wilt bee content to make some tryall of the power &amp; abilitie, of the Saints to help thee, by recommending thy selfe seriously to their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for thee; desiring them to beseech Almightie God, that thou maist ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sufficient light to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his euery sauing truth, and effectuall grace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, And in perticuler, to recommend thy poore Soule to the prayers of the Mother of God, our Blessed Ladye; who, as Saint <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> saith, is the neck vnder Christ our head, whereby all Grace descendeth vnto euery member of his myst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Bodie. For I doubt not thou shalt finde that true comfort, and Reall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the excercises
<pb facs="48"/> thereof, with such a touch of Gods finger, as well bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perswade thy hart, then any other Pen can maister thy vnderstanding, vntill it please his diuine Maiestie to subiect it fully to the rule of faith; and to place it firmly on the <hi>Rocke</hi> which is <hi>the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and foundation of truth.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And so remitting thee to the Prayers them selues of this Booke, I desire to be pertaker of their good effects: &amp;c. rest.</p>
