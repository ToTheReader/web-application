   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Lords, I had intended to haue presented to your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ladie-mother, now at rest with God, the first fruits of my labours in this kind, containing a iust defence of Gods truth and the credit of Dorts Synod against some of <hi>Arminius</hi> his schollers here at home, who will not be reclaimed by the graue sentence of that late Councell, nor affrighted with the strange death of their maister: but as <hi>Arrius</hi> his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, after his fearfull death did labour to scatter his errors farre and neare, so do these with vs. But
<pb facs="3"/>your Honours may obiect to me, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. To which I answer, that partly <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and partly the importunitie of some enemies did draw me forth both by preaching and printing to assay to stop the mouthes of gainsayers. Now I humbly offer to your Lordships view the true Chhristian Noble-man, who by the Spirit of Adoption calleth God <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.15.</hi> and which <hi>Iob</hi> stiles Christ, Iob <hi>19.25. Goeli, My redeeming kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> and with <hi>Isay,</hi> Isa. <hi>5.1. Dodi, My neere kinsman.</hi> Your Honours may best challenge this little Treatise as your owne right, because that I gained the greatest part of my litle learning through my acquaintance with your honorable fathers house and family, where you had a most religious and truly noble breeding and education, by the zealous care of your pious and truly religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Ladie <hi>Bathshebah</hi> neglected not to teach her yong <hi>Lemuels</hi> humane and diuine knowledge, Prou. <hi>31.1, 2.</hi> Your truly noble fathers house for state and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment somewhat resembled <hi>Salomons</hi> Court, <hi>2.</hi> Chron. <hi>9.4.</hi> where <hi>Shebaes</hi> Queene obserued the meate of his table, the sitting of his seruants, and the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his ministers. And your famous Wilton house, like a litle Vniuersitie was a more excellent nurcerie for learning and pietie, then euer it was in former times, when King <hi>Edgars</hi> daughter <hi>Editha</hi> had her residence and regencie there: so that Popish <hi>S.F.E.</hi> had no need to seek the restoring of it to its former vses. Wilton house had in it that godly learned Phisitian and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mathematician M. Doctor <hi>Moffet</hi> my most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and kind friend; it had in it great <hi>Hugh Sanford</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>learned in all arts, sciences, knowledge, humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, <hi>vsque ad miraculum,</hi> whom I euer obserued as <hi>Horace</hi> did his <hi>Maerenas</hi> euer before him, <hi>singul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim pauca locutus,</hi> from whom I neuer departed without some profit. To passe ouer <hi>Gerard</hi> the Herbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, M. <hi>Massinger</hi> and other Gentlemen schollers. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer noble house had successiuely deeper Diuines, namely Bishop <hi>Babington,</hi> B. <hi>Parry,</hi> M. <hi>Connā,</hi> M. <hi>Walford,</hi> M. <hi>Parker,</hi> M. <hi>Bigs.</hi> In this noble House <hi>Babingtons</hi> rules of pietie and honestie swayed, swearing was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; yea the house-keepers and inferour seruants well knew and practised the grounds of Religion, as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> commendeth the ploughmen of Palestina for their Halleluiahs. These were the Trophees of your fathers house; he honoured God, and God honoured him, and you his seed enioy the blessing: whereas the seed of the wicked, <hi>lo ijqqare le holam,</hi> shall not be famous for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Isa. <hi>14.20.</hi> The seed of the righteous shall be great or strong in the earth, <hi>Dor iesharim ieuorach,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the vpright shall be blessed, Psal <hi>112.1, 2. Wisedome with an inheritance is good,</hi> saith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Eccles. <hi>7.12.</hi> God hath blessed your Honours with a goodly heritage, Psal. <hi>16.6.</hi> The price of wisedome is in your hands, Oh let your hearts be to it, Prou. <hi>17.16.</hi> To whom much is giuen, of them much is required, Luk. <hi>12.48.</hi> You cannot say with the Poet,
