Then also I printed a general &amp; perticular handling &amp; order of healing such diseases as are incidēt to the same parts, subiect to the Chirurgiōs cure &amp; administration. And now, lest for lacke

of choice of medicines in all those cases, the soile of this worthie Art should seeme to be barren, &amp; not able to yeeld plentifull varietie, to satisfie euery reasonable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Artist,</hi> in the most high &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult cures; I haue gathered and published this manuall <hi>Antidotarie,</hi> furnished as a fruitful medow, with some things seruing to necessitie onelie, &amp; other things affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding delight besides: also as a faire forest which (besides the large scopes &amp; delite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some chases) conteineth trees likewise of all growths, and required vses: for in like maner, here are medicins, some of thē bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, biting &amp; painful, seruing wher neither ease, nor delight of taste, but recouerie of health requireth to be cared for. Yea here are medicines, differing in groweth, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; strength: some of speedie, others of lōger preparation, some for new-grown, other for inueterat diseases; some for sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, others for malign &amp; depraued affects; some to be chosen for the tender &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, &amp; others more fit for the rusticall or harder natured bodies. Againe, whereas mens liking of writings, and tasting of

wines, are things verie agreeable to bee brought into cōparison: (for one saith of new inuentions; these are of none aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the ancient deuises are better: another saith of the old, these are stale, the later are fitter for our times &amp; bodies) I haue inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored (as farre forth as I might) to satisfie both affections: for which cause I haue not onely collected out of the best written practises both of old &amp; late yeres, &amp; obtei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned of my frends, verie rare &amp; tried medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as many as I could, but also, haue (as it were) emptied my self of mine own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar furniture, and deliuered of the verie secrets of my practise; lest any thing shuld be wanting, on my part, to the fulnesse of the work.
