      <p>The Latine, or Catholicke Romane Church, might conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
be placed in the second place. Her primate is called in

         <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or more commonly <hi>Papa,</hi> in English
<note n="i" place="margin">Father.</note> Pope, a name which all they of the East Church doe giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all their Priests. This Pope is acknowledged by the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, by some Germanes and Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and withall by some Americans and Indians, which of
late are conquered and conuerted by the Spaniards. The
Romane Catholickes do say and affirme themselues to be very
strongly vnited together, because that they depend vpon one
head or chiefe: Neuerthelesse, they are not all of one accord so
farre as his authoritie doth extend. Some doe attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him full authoritie ouer the Church and Councels, and ouer
Kings, and Common-wealthes, others doe contradict<note n="k" place="margin">Panor. de concil. Basil.</note> it.
Neuerthelesse these doe tollerate the Pope in his attempts
vnto the very execution of them, which is the cause that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
is noted to be in schismes and scandals, and her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in warres and dissentions.</p>
      <p>The third Christian nation, is the South or Meridionall
Church, which containeth the Nubians, and the<note n="l" place="margin">Theuet Cos. lib. 4 cap. 2.</note> Abyssins,
subiects of<note n="m" place="margin">King.</note> Negus of Ethiop, otherwise called<note n="n" place="margin">Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke.</note> Prester-Iohn,
and many that are scattered in Egypt, Arabia, and Chaldea,
which are called Iacobits or Israelites, because that they are
of the linage or race of <hi>Iacob,</hi> otherwise called Israel: But
some are of opinion that they take name of one <hi>Iacob</hi> an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke.
They are called of some in Greeke <hi>Cophites,</hi> or in
Hebrew<note n="o" place="margin">Broken or Cut.</note>
         <hi>Cophtes,</hi> because that they vse Circumcision.
Their Primate maketh his residence in Caire, and is called

The fourth Christian nation, are the Nestorians, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to hold the heresies of old<note n="q" place="margin">
            <hi>Isch-ja</hi> a man of God.</note>
         <hi>Nestor,</hi> which are dispersed

and is called<note n="s" place="margin">Sent from God.</note> Iascelich. The Historiographers doe not
exactly report the truth, what is, or in times past hath beene
their beliefe, which is the reason wherefore we do not aleadge
them very often.</p>
      <p>The fift Nation is that of Armenia,<note n="s" place="margin">M. Masius in praef. in lib Mosis de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad.</note> which (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
might be thought to be of the Romane Church, because
that they haue offered themselues to her in hate of the<note n="t" place="margin">Nichol. l. 4. cap. 19.</note> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and their<note n="u" place="margin">Vniuersal.</note> Catholike, (for so they call their chiefe
head) did submit himselfe to the Pope of Rome: but the truth
is, that the Romane Church doeth hold them all for<note n="x" place="margin">Alphons. de Castro de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. passim.</note> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
although that shee doeth deale more discreetly with
them, for to withdraw them by little and little to her<note n="y" place="margin">Vilamont. l. 2. cap. 23.</note> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
      <p>The Protestants or reformed Christians, doe make the
sixt Church of Christians, they inhabite a great part of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,
and the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, Denmarke,
and Swethia, and haue Churches in France, Flanders and
Poland. This reformation attempted and desired by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigeans,
and Valdians, was receiued in Bohemia, in the yeere
1400. or there abouts, and afterwards in the yeere of<note n="z" place="margin">Sleidan de Stat. Rel. lib. 1. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

established in the said Regions by the doctrine of <hi>Luther,
Melanchton, Zuinglius, Bucer, Caluin</hi> and others. The
reformed haue not Primate in common neither any generall
Synods, which are the<note n="a" place="margin">Cyprian de simpl. Cl.</note> Markes and Bands of Vnitie:
and from thence haue proceeded and entred amongst them,
with great scandale, the diuisions and names of Hussits, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,
Caluins and Puritans.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <head>¶Secondly, Certaintie of Christian Religion.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>FOrasmuch as we intend to intreate of diuers points of the
Euangelicall veritie: It seemeth necessarie vnto vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all things, to establish and shew the foundation: The
which shall bee of more authoritie if we insert here, the
end of a learned discourse of</hi> Gennade, <hi>Patriarke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Gennadius <hi>Confession</hi> Hist. Eccl. de Const.</note>
         <hi>made by him in the presence of</hi> Mahomet <hi>the
second Emperour of the Turkes.</hi> Besides these reasons
(<hi>saith he</hi>) there are seuen which doe altogether assure
vs of our faith. The first, because that the Prophets of
the Iewes, the which we doe receiue, haue foretold of
IESVS and all that which he did, and his Disciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him through his power: And in like maner the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Grecians by the permission of GOD, and
the Astronomers of Persia and of Greece, did foretell
of him. The second, because the holy Scriptures is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
conformable to our Faith; for that those which
did write them, had all one teacher; to wit, the grace of
God: for if the same had not beene, they had differed
and varied in some point. The third, because that
men receiued this faith (although new and strange)
with great care, among all nations, and in great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
And not onely the foolish, but also the wise and
prudent:<note place="margin">The Sybils.</note> and all Diabolicke deceit was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed
and ouerthrowne:<note place="margin">To wit, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</note> The fourth, because that this
faith contayneth nothing that is impossible, and which
disagreeth with it selfe: and that there is no corporall
thing therein, but rather spirituall, and it is the way
which leadeth the soule to the loue of God, and to the
<pb facs="7"/>
hope of euerlasting life: The fift, because that those
which haue receiued this faith, and that haue liued ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
according to the loue of Christ, haue receiued
great gifts of God, and haue wrought many miracles:
the which could not haue beene done, had not the faith
beene true. The sixt, because that all that, which may
be obiected against it, is easily refuted with firme argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The seuenth, because that the Kings of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme
Countries, haue made Warres against this faith
with infinite power and cruelties during many ages,
and haue profited nothing at all, but rather the faith
hath preuailed so well, insomuch that it doth persist
vntill this present, and when the Lord doth come he
shall finde it. To the same Iesus our Lord and true
God be glory for euer. Amen.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>¶Thirdly, the Subiect and end of this Treatise.</head>
      <p>IF the Schismes doe ruinate Christendome by the aduantage
that the Infidels doe take, it is nothing lesse endamaged
by the scandall which Christians themselues doe receiue the
one of the other: the one liueth vncertaine of that which he
ought to beleeue, the other perswadeth himselfe that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the right way, and animated out of measure against
the opinion of the rest, he doth but attend the houre to renew
those auncient Furors. If any man speake of a Councell, or
to correct and eschue those vitious and scandalous extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he is so soone reproued by those which haue the eares of
Kings and people.<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 120. 7.</note>
         <hi>I seeke peace</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>and
when I talke thereof, they are bent to warres.</hi> The say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="8"/>
of <hi>Zaga</hi> Bishop of Ethiope, and Embassadour of Prester
<note n="b" place="margin">Damian à Goes de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. Aethiop.</note>
         <hi>Iohn</hi> is more charitable: <hi>It is a miserable thing</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that Christian strangers should be so sharpely reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
as enemies, as I haue beene heere: and other things
which concerne not the true faith: But it should be farr
more conuenient to support all Christians, be they
Grecians, be they Armenians, be they Ethiopians, be
they of any one of the seuen Christian Churches, with
charity and loue of CHRIST, and to permit them to
liue and conuerse amongst other christian brethren
without any iniurie, because that we are all Infants of
one Baptisme, and doe hold truely the true faith: and
there is no reason to dispute so sharpely touching cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but rather that euery one should obserue and
keepe his owne, without hating or troubling the other,
and not to be excluded out of the commerce of the
Church; if being a stranger in other Prouinces hee
keepe and obserue the customes of his owne Country.</hi>
This is the Discourse of a Moore,<note place="margin">Impedit ira animum ne possit cernere verum.</note> which should make vs
blush: But seeing that ignorance obscureth the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and that anger stoppeth the eares, and shutteth the eyes
of the men of this world: It resteth for the Louers of peace
and trueth, to put in practise the commandement of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<hi>Take heede</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the leauen of the</hi>
         <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 16. 6.</note>
         <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees:</hi>
For who can assure himselfe that this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath not more scope? But, some man will say, what
meanes is there to discerne this leauen and these Pharisees,
in so great a conflict of reason? The answere is, that when the
Scriptures, the which all Christians doe claime, haue not
sufficient light, for to make the trueth in the doctrine of
controuersies, to bee apparently perceiued: Yet may a man
<pb facs="8"/>
now a dayes vse that meanes which S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> councelleth
<note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra haeres.</note> vs, which is, that he haue a recourse to the Churches, where
the Apostles haue conuersed for to learne the Apostolicke
tradition. But men are farre enough from taking this way.
The one perswadeth himselfe that the Apostolicke Churches
are perished, the other calleth them plaine heretickes: For it
is manifest, that we must beleeue the promise of the Son of
God, who said to his Apostles, yea, as well to them as to the
Colledge of their successors, <hi>Goe through the vniuersall
world, behold I am with you vntill the consumation of
the</hi>
         <note n="e" place="margin">
            <hi>Mat.</hi> cap. vlt. 20,</note>
         <hi>world.</hi> Here is the full But of this Treatise, to make
men see by Testimonie of Historiographers, being ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
witnesses, and of vnreproueable Authors, that there are
Churches in the Apostolicke Sees, and for to shew that they
are conformable among themselues, and to the Scripture, in
that which is necessarie to saluation. As for ceremonies or
curious Questions, it matters not, if euery one of them doeth
make, or beleeue that which seemeth him best: That which is
worst of all, is the diuision, which proceedeth of zeale, but with
little charitie, and it will not be amisse to recite the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth: <hi>If you</hi> (saith he) <hi>bee
otherwise minded, GOD shall reueale euen the same
vnto</hi>
         <note n="f" place="margin">
            <hi>Phil</hi> cap. 3. 15.</note>
         <hi>you.</hi> As for the rest, this Treatise is not for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sort, of whom we are willing to receiue both councell and
correction wheresoeuer it shall so fall out: It is but for to
solace those which desire to learne, and haue not the meanes
to read diuers authors, especially the Greeke and Latin, Those
also that search discourses garnished and painted out, with
all sorts of flowers and coulers, shall not bee here satisfied.
This subiect cannot permit any rhetoricall sentences, and
the fashion of the Treatise is farre wide from it, here is
<pb facs="9"/>
but a Collection of diuerse passages, Coppies and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of authors word by word, with briefe and simple Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The breuity is, to the end that the simplicity should
not be enuious, and the simplicity is, because that it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
both to the matter and argument: In like manner
because that which is most plainely spoken, should haue lest
suspicion and be more intelligible. I doe not doubt that this
breuity will giue any aduantage to the contentious: But I
shall haue better meanes hereafter to satisfie them, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Let it then suffice thee for this present (Catholicke
Reader) to haue here a beginning of the knowledge of this
subiect, a knowledge which will increase in thee, through the
loue of the truth. The ancient Bishop <hi>Meliton,</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi>
writeth)<note n="g" place="margin">Hist. Eccl. l. 4. cap. 22.</note> did visite the Churches of the East, for to learne
what were the Canonicall Bookes, and true writings
of the Apostles: If thou doest read this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment,
thou shalt imitate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any paine, the holy curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of this good man.</p>
