   <p>THe second sermon declareth what a Sacrament is, that the nature &amp; matter of the sygnes remayneth▪ that Christ affirmeth breade to be his body, and wyne to be his bloude for thre properties and similitudes, and not for any transubstantiatiō, and mutation of their natures. That his body &amp; bloude are the sustinaunce of mannes soule and spirite, which are not fed or nourished w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> corporall food. That both the spirituall eating, and the sacramental receit are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and commaunded. That by our worthy receyt of the sacrament, we are made Christes body, not by fayth only: but also realli. What a testamēt is, what the new testament is, &amp; what the ould is.


<pb facs="3"/>
That the ould christians before Christes cumming, did eat his body &amp; drinke his bloud, as truly, as really, and as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as we do. How Christes body and bloud be present in his holy supper, that they ar not to be honored in the forme of bread and wine with eleuatiō of handes or kneling, but by faith in them, by cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his supper, bi geuing of thanks and by offring vnto him frankēsēce and myrre, that is to say: by confessing him to be very natural man borne of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the fulnesse of tyme for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptiō: and very god begotten of his father before al tyme, that this is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike fayth, and the doctrine of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fathers of Christes church.</p>
