      <hi>GRimellos</hi> Fortunes were more then were spoken of, and such as are, you may easily consider of: Who runnes many courses, is some-time out of the way, and so was hee, and euery man cannot thriue, no more did he: yet his will was good, so may be yours: But his Fortune was so so, so may be yours. But what became of him in the end, is not spoken: and what you meane to doe, I cannot Iudge. Him I had litle acquaintance with, and you lesse: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his name I haue reade, but yours I know not, that I haue heard of: Of him I heare no euill, nor wish to heare any of you: Him I finde wittie, and you I hope to finde wise; if not, I shall be sorrie for your witte, as mine owne Fortune, to let my labours fall into your hands. But I will thinke the best, and so in the best thought I rest in hope of your patience.</p>
