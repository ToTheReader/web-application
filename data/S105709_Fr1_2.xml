   <head>TO THE COVRTEOVS Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian READER,</hi> Nothing is more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the worldlinesse of vs Christians. Our life is little else but a breach of our most solemne vow to the Lord of life. Wee renounced the world at our first entrance into the Church of God, deuoting our selues to the seruice of Christ. (These were good words, if there were any thing besides words in the most of vs.) But being growne wee renounce Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the seruice of the world in all our actions. Our deeds proue that wee doe but onely talke of God and Christ, and heauen: for what hath God but our breath? and with what doe wee seeke heauen, but with the tongue? the world hath heart and hands, and (if not all yet) most of all our strength. Being therefore (against my will, and earnest
<pb facs="3"/>entreatie to the contrary) commaunded to speak vnto this great congregation, I thought I could not discharge mine owne dutie, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the present auditorie better, than if I did labour to beate downe this vice, which hath gotten more ground against the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, (I thinke) then the diuels whole hoast of lusts besides. If I haue offended in any thing, it is in being too plaine: which whether it be a fault, yea or no, in a preacher, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine with my selfe, but I know well it is lesse faulty, then that other extreame which in our times is more in price and vse. Yet me thinkes the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hath giuen vs a very good direction, saying; <hi>it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue the beleeuers.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.21.</note> Doth the Apostle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace Gods ordinance by giuing it such a name? or doth hee not rather deride mens censures that so miscall it? For not the wise, not the learned, not the wittie, not the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent kinde of preaching, doth helpe mens soules to heauen; but that kinde, which the greatest part (out of their fleshlinesse) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme base and foolish, because it wants the excellencie of words, &amp; the enticing speeches of mans wisedome, as elsewhere the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith; <hi>If I should aime at any other
<pb facs="3"/>end in preaching, then the saluation of men: were I not accursed for doing Gods work negligently, or peruersely?</hi> If ayming at this, I should vse any but his owne meanes, were I not foolish, that would prefer mine own thoughts to his? If this kind of preaching please God, why not speaker? why not hearer? why not all? If it saue men, why should it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent those that come, the one to offer, the other to seeke saluation? To say the truth, I doe not vnwillingly confesse, that my learning is but small: For much learning requireth much reading, &amp; much reading many yeares, which all that know me, know to be wanting vnto me. Wherefore to make shew of much (by the helpe of an index or such like) when I haue it not, were but a cousoning tricke, and a pranke beseeming a bragger or a bankerout, of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>There is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himselfe rich and hath nothing.</hi> But say I had had the greatest abundance of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet it behoued me to remember, that a pulpit is not a place to shew schollership in, but faithfulnes, nor to declare how well read we are in other authours, but how ill practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the hearers are in the will and word of God the best author. Preaching was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to tickle the eare with a gay speech
<pb facs="4"/>and learned oration, but to peirce the heart, with a sharpe reproofe and earnest exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to winne credit and applause to the speaker; but to work knowledge and obedience in the hearer: not to make the auditorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vs, and say, <hi>sure hee is a good Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a man of good wit and great reading, &amp;c.</hi> But to condemne themselues, and say wee haue beene bad men, men of polluted hearts and liues. In a word, not to draw men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the gifts of him that speaketh, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him preferment; but to repent of their owne sinnes, and offer submission vnto Christ that sent him to speake. This if the Minister aime at, hee is happy, and the people also, if he attaine it; but whosoeuer aimes at credit or profit in preaching, may goe from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to hell, and take his wages with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite to whom it is saide, that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his reward. Loth would I be to buy praise or profit at such a price, neyther did I dare to hazard my selfe vnto God, for misintending his ordinance, and handling his word in a wrong manner. With this determination did I come to speake; with this determination should euery Christian come to heare. And if any twit me with the name of an English Preacher (a name taken vp to disgrace the
<pb facs="4"/>foolishnes of preaching which God commends) I haue to answere, that I speake to English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and, the most, no Schollers, otherwise it had not beene hard to haue heaped vp, and learned by heart, and spoken readily many a Greeke and Latin sentence fit for the purpose: but who would loose labor and time, &amp; make two speakings where one would serue the turne? And in this plaine manner <hi>(Reader)</hi> haue I encountred, by the sword of the spirit, this capital euill of the world, which is world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse I was willing to publish, being spoken, what I was not willing to speake, hoping to helpe some man against the sinne, (which I speake against) besides mine hearers, if but one Christian grow lesse earthly by benefit of this labour, my recompence is sufficient; if not one, yet I haue this fruite that I intended to doe good and endeauoured it. Now <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou meete with any fault, censure it with fauour, for I am but a man, and in reading apply nothing to any, but to thy selfe, &amp; I haue my desire. Thus I commend thee, and thy grouth in vertue, to the helpe and assistance of our gracious Father. </p>
