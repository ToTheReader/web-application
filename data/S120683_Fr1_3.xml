   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>I Have found nothing (good Reader) in Mr. Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons confutation worthie of any answere, but that which is borrowed from D. Morton or D. Denison, and hath been already answered in Perth assemblie. What is his owne, is new, but so absurd, that just lie he hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the change of his surname frō Michelsone to Nihilsone. The judicious Reader may finde as much in Perth assemblie untouched, as may serve for defence of that which he hath lightly touched: and may find further in the Solution of D. Resolutus his resolutions for kneeling. I have now added this defence of our reasons, not so much for reply to his confutation (for that was needlesse) as for illustration, and confirmation of that which hath been alreadie written in the two former, and to obviat such cavillations, as perhaps may be used by some other of our opposites. I will keep the same ordour, which our Antagonist hath set down̄e: howbeit he hath divided our arguments, to make them seeme the weaker, as Medea rent, and scattered the members of her brother, that ther by she might the more safely flee: which fault Peter Martyr objected to Gardinerus. His arguments for kneeling shal be answered in the defence of our reasons, as occasion shall offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> self: for his answers and arguments are all alike, and of equall strength. I will also, so farr as I may, eschew repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing already written in the two former treatises <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ent this argument: yet so that this Defence shalbe, as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ope, sufficient without them. Mr. Michelsone hath chosen a worthy Patron to his Pamphlet, my Lord of Scoone. The one keeped the doore sometime, when the other did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ordinance of the high Commission. Such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>tuce. He hath given so notable proofe of profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Divinitie, and subtilitie in handling this controversie in this worthie work of his, that the Bishop of St. Andros, (a man as voyd of learning, as of good manners,) hath made him a Doctor. He hath been sorning at the Treasurers gates for his wages, but he will not rest contented, till he get that which he gapeth for, a fatt bishoprik, the hope wherof will sharpen the witt of very mules and asses, lett be of so fine a witt, as Doctor Michelson hath.</p>
