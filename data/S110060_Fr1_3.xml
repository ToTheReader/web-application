      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present to the publike view an abstract of new England; which I have undertaken to compose by the incouragment of such genious spirits as have been studious of the inlargment of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Territories, being not formerly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by the relations of such as through haste, have taken but a superficiall survey thereof, which thing time hath enabled mee to performe more punctually to the life, and to give a more exact accompt of what hath been required; I have therefore beene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe my indevoure to communicat the knowledge, which I have gained and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together, by mine owne observation, in the time of my many yeares residence in those parts, to my loving Country men: For the better information of all such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be made partakers of the blessings of God in that fertile Soyle, as well as those
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>that, out of Curiosity onely have bin inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive after nouelties. And the rather for that I have observed, how divers persons (not so well affected to the weale publike in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) out of respect to their owne private ends; have laboured to keepe both the practise of the people there, and the Reall worth of that eminent Country concealed from publike knowledge, both which I have abundantly in this discourse layd open, yet if it be well accepted, I shall esteeme my selfe sufficiently rewardded for my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and rest.</p>
