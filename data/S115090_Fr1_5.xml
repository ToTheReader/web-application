Crashawe, Batchelour of Diuinitie, and preacher at the temple; iustified by the authour, both against papist, and Brownist, to be the truth: wherein, this point is principally followed; namely, that the religion of Rome, as now it stands established, is worse then euer it was</title>

   <head>To the Christian Reader whosoeuer, be he a true Catholicke, or a Romish.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prevent all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits that might arise vpon the so late cōming forth of this Sermon, so many weekes expected, I desire thee good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be satisfied; the cause thereof, was a long &amp; vnlooked for journey. And now that you haue it, let me desire all men in the reading &amp; iudging therof, to deale with that ingenuity and sinceritie, as I haue ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored in the writing of it. My cōscience speakes for me, I haue forged no new Author, I haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified none, I haue corrupted none, I haue to my knowledge misalledged none: I haue taken no proofe vpō bare report, nor haue I produced our men to proue what I lay against them: nor is there
<pb facs="6"/> one quotation of any Authour of theirs, which I haue not diligently perused afore-hand, and the whole scope of the place. If any should thinke of answere, I desire him let passe all personall ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and by-matters, and come directly to the points in issue: which be these;</p>
   <q>
      <p n="1">1 <hi>Whether the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teach &amp; practice in these xx. or xxi. points, as I haue charged her withall, or no.</hi>
      </p>
      <p n="2">2 <hi>If she do, whether they be healed of these wounds as yet, or no.</hi>
      </p>
      <p n="3">3 <hi>If she be not, thē how she can be the true Church, which is so wounded, and will not be healed.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>If they doe not teach and practice so, I will yeeld the Cause. And hee that can shew me that either she is healed since, or beeing not healed, how she can be the true Church, I shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare him, and thank him. I desire all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues Papists, or their fauourers, not to be so wilfull as to condemne what they know not, but onely to giue it reading, and then iudge as they see cause. <hi>Wright,</hi> in his Articles, layeth to our charge many strange Paradoxes: as, that <hi>wee are all Atheists, and Infidels by our doctrine;</hi> that <hi>wee are bounde by our doctrine to doe no good workes,</hi> and many such. And <hi>Kellison</hi> in his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaies,
<pb facs="6"/> thrusts vpon vs that <hi>wee deny Christ to bee the onely Sauiour,</hi> and <hi>Judge of quicke and dead,</hi> and many such abhominations; all which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and detest: yet, do what we can, we must haue them layd vpon vs; and our Writers &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue their speeches wrung and wrested, beyond their meaning to make them sound that way. I dare appeale to the iudgement of Gods Church, and all Iudicious Readers heereof, that I haue not done so with them, nor taken vantage of their words, when it's apparant they meant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; but charged thē onely with such points of doctrine and practice, as themselues cannot deny but to be their owne: and that not of one or two, but (for the most part) generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Commending it to thy reading, and my selfe to thy prayers, I leaue vs all to Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. At the Temple. May, 21. 1608.</p>
