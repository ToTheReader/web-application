   <head>Sebastian Serlius to the Reader.</head>
   <p>LOuing and friendly Reader, after I had collected certaine rules of Architecture, thinking that not only▪ those of deepe conceyt would vnderstand them, but that also each indifferent man of wit might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue them, as he is more or lesse addicted to such an Art; which rules are deuided into seuen Books, as hereunder shall be set downe: but for that this Art requireth it, therefore I thought it requisite to begin with this fourth Booke, and to set it out, first, which is more to the purpose, and more necessary then the rest, for the knowledge of many sorts of Building and ornaments thereof, to the end that euery one may haue some knowledge of this Art, the which is no lesse pleasing to the mind of those workmen that thinke vpon things that are to make, then also to mens eyes when they are made. Which Art, by the wisedome of the famous and excellent spirits that are now in the world, doth flourish in these dayes, as the Latine tongue did in the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> Then with glad and ioyfull heart receyue at least my good will, (though the effect ensueth not) which, in trueth, I haue (to pleasure and satisfie your minds) in this respect.</p>
   <p>In the first Booke, I will entreat of the beginning of Geometry, and of diuers cuttings through of lines, in such sort, that the workman may yeeld reason for that he worketh.</p>
   <p>In the second Booke, I will shew in Figure, and by reason, as much of Perspectiue Art, that if the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will, he may declare his conceyt or purpose, by reasons and figure.</p>
   <p>In the third Booke, workmen shall see the Ichnographie, that is, the ground: the Orthographie, that is, the raysing vp of a Building before. The Scenographie or Sciographie, that is, the insight, by shortening of the most part of the Buildings that are in Rome, Italie, &amp;c. diligently measured, and set by them in writing, with the places where they are, and their names.</p>
   <p>In the fourth, which is this, I will speake of fiue maner of Buildings, and of their ornaments, as Thus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scana, Dorica, Ionica, Corinthia and Composita, that is to say, mingled. And by these, the whole Arte is learned.</p>
   <p>In the fift, I will speake of diuers kinds of Temples, set downe in diuers formes, that is, round, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square, six-cornerd, eyght-cornerd, Ouall-wise, and crosse-wise, with their ground, heights and shortenings, diligently measured.</p>
   <p>In the sixt, I will speake of all dwellings, which, at this day, may bee vsed, beginning at the meanest house or cotrage, and so from degree to degree, proceeding to the most rich, fayre and princely Palaces, as well in Countrie villages, as in great Cities or Townes.</p>
   <p>In the seuenth and last, shall be set downe many accidents, which may happen to workemen in diuers places, strange maner of situation, repayring of decayed houses, and how we should helpe our selues with pieces of other buildings, with such things as are to be vsed, and at other times haue stood in worke.</p>
   <p>Now then, to proceed readily herein, I will begin with the greatest and rusticke order of Building, that is, the Thuscan, being the playnest, rudest, and strongest, and of least grace and seemelinesse.</p>
