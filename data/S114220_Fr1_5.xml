                 <title>A treatise tending to mitigation tovvardes Catholicke-subiectes in England : VVherin is declared, that it is not impossible for subiects of different religion, (especially Catholickes and Protestantes) to liue togeather in dutifull obedience and subiection, vnder the gouernment of his Maiesty of Great Britany. Against the seditious wrytings of Thomas Morton minister, &amp; some others to the contrary. Whose two false and slaunderous groundes, pretended to be dravvne from Catholicke doctrine &amp; practice, concerning rebellion and equiuocation, are ouerthrowne, and cast vpon himselfe.

   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <head type="sub">OF THE PRESENT DIVISION AND DISAGREEMENT About matters of Religion in England, and of many importune exasperations vsed by diuers sortes of men, to encrease the same: and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely by this Minister T. M. his iniurious Libell.</head>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>I DOE</hi> not see (deare Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) why I may not iustly (our tymes &amp; circumstances therof considered) begin these my first lynes of Preface with those wordes of Complaint and Admiration of the Poet <hi>Lucan,</hi> wherby in few verses he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and laid forth the rufull state of the
<pb n="2" facs="16"/>
rented Common-welth and Romane Empire by ciuill warres, saying:</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Bella per<note n="*" place="margin">Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos.</note> Aemathios plusquam ciuilia campos</l>
      <l>Ius{que} datum sceleri<note n="*" place="margin">Flemus.</note> canimus: populum{que} potētem,</l>
      <l>In sua victrici conuersum viscera dextra.</l>
   </lg>
   <p n="2">2. For if heere we change but <hi>Thessalian fieldes</hi> into <hi>English land,</hi> and the Poets <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> into our weeping and wailing, all the rest agreeth most aptly, if our diuision be not more rufull and lamentable then that of the Romanes. For first our wars may truly be said to be <hi>plus quam ciuilia,</hi> more then<note place="margin">Plus quàm ciuilia.</note> ciuill, in that they are not only internall, but domesticall also, in such sorte, as no one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, no one towne, no one village, no one howse or family is lightly to be found, where some parte or other of this warre and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">The pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

with his friend: and the neerest of kyn with those whome lawe of nature, &amp; bandof bloud did most straitly combine &amp; knit togeather.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Neither is this warre ended only in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, or in bare debate of mindes, iudgements, willes and affections, but it breaketh forth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so into workes, and hostile actions, to the sight and admiration of all the worlde, no aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Camps or armies standing more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and distrustfull one of an other, or vsing more stratagems of discouery, spiery, preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or impugnation, the one against the other, then we among our selues; wherof our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall searches, priuy intelligences, bloudy and desperate conspiracies, apprehensions, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, tortures, arraignementes, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and executions are most loath some and lamentable witnesses.</p>
   <p n="4">4 And as for <hi>Ius datum sceleri,</hi> neuer could<note place="margin">Iusque datum sceleri.</note> it be spoken so properly in the Romans misery as in ours, when in deed (though in some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense) that which was ius before, is now <hi>scelus,</hi> to uvitt, that which was law, right, and equity under Catholicke Religion, is now offensiue and punishable by the lawes of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
      <pb n="4" facs="17"/>
that which was then piety, is now ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that which by them was vsed for deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is now scorned for <hi>superstition,</hi> that which they reuerenced for highest Religion, is now held in contempt and greatest derision; such as then should haue byn hated and punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed for hereticks, are now esteemed for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and best reformed Catholicks, and they vvhich in those dayes vvere called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> as vvell by their enemyes as themselues, and sate in iudgement vpon the rest, are now brought into iudgement vnder them vvhose iudges at that tyme they vvere, in the self same cause, right and lawe being changed vvith the tyme, and equity vvith mens affections, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of olde faith become crymes of new treason, and finally all so inuerted and turned vpside downe, and the differences so pursued vvith such hostile emnity of exulcerated mindes, as the Poets conclusion falleth vpon vs euidently in<note place="margin">Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumque poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in sua, &amp;c.</note> the eye of all Christendome, that vve being a potent people, and dreadfull otherwise to all our neighbours, haue turned our victorious hands into our owne bowels, by this disunion in Religion, and therby haue iust cause to feare
<pb n="5" facs="17"/>
the euent and inference threatned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour (except his holy hand protect vs) that; <hi>Euery Kingdome deuided in it selfe shall<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> come to desolation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5. And that vvhich most encreaseth the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this misery is, that no man endeauoreth to mollify matters, but all to exasperate; no man applieth lenitiues, but all corrosiues; no man powreth in vvyne or oyle into the wound, but all salte and vinegar; no man byndeth<note place="margin">Exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> vp or fomenteth, but euery one seeketh to crush, bruze, and breake more; all cry and clap their hands to exulceration, saying with the children of <hi>Edom,</hi> in the day of <hi>Hierusalems</hi> affliction: <hi>Exinanite, exinanite, vsque ad<note place="margin">Psal. 136.</note> fundamentum in ea.</hi> Pull her downc, pull her downe euen vnto the foundation.</p>
   <p n="6">6. And to this effect haue vve heard and seene many speeches and sermons made, sundry Bookes and pamphlets cast abroad or set forth in print, some before the late cruell and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension.</note> conspiracy (which might perhaps be some incitation to the designemēt or hastening ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and some presently therupon, not only to exaggerate that fact (whose atrocity by it self
<pb n="6" facs="18"/>
is such, as scarsely it leaueth any place to exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration) but also to extend and draw out the hatred and participation therof to others of the same Religion most innocent therin, yea vnto the whole multitude, so far as in them lieth, a matter of exorbitant iniustice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate malice.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Of the former sorte of bookes and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets<note place="margin">Of boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phletes.</note> we haue seene one set forth the yeare past by <hi>Thomas Hamond,</hi> intituled: <hi>The late Commotion of certeine Papists in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Shire, about the buriall of one Alice VVellington Recusant, after the Popish manner, in the tovvne of Alens-moore, tvvo miles frō Hereford &amp;c.</hi> VVhich thing though it were but the fact of a few poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people Catholickly affected (as most are knowne to be in those partes) to bury the said<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</note>
      <hi>Alice,</hi> and that in a sorte they were forced therunto, least the dead corps should rot aboue ground (the Minister of the place most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly refusing to bury the same) and that some other false companion in like manner is thought to haue byn set a worke to induce them into that trap, as since hath byn vnderstood: yet
<pb n="7" facs="18"/>
was the matter so exaggerated euery where, both by bookes, preachings, and publike speeches of Magistrates, as if it had byn a most heinous attempt in deed: and not only these, but by this occasion all Catholicks generally were most odiously traduced, especially in this one point (that touched them neerest) to wit, that they would seeme to conceaue any least hope of his Maiesties clemency and mercy towardes them by way of toleration or conniuency for their Religion, or mitigation of their continuall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for the same.</p>
   <p n="8">8. To which end were brought into this booke and published in print not only the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of <hi>London</hi> his sermon at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse vpon the fifth of August then past, wherein he auowed his Maiesties protestation against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes<note place="margin">In the Epistle of T. H. 22. Iunij 1605.</note> to the contrary, but the speach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and charge of the <hi>L. Chancellour</hi> in the Star-chamber vnto the Lordes, Iudges, and communalty there present ready to departe into their countryes, was deliuered as from the Kings owne mouth, all tending to the same end of afflicting, and disgracing the said people, and depriuing them of all hope
<pb n="8" facs="19"/>
of any tolerance, yea<note n="*" place="margin">Auant false and lying Varlets <hi>(saith one)</hi> your vvordes are vaine, and your hopes are more vaine.</note> scoffing most bitterly and contemptuously at their folly, for concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any such vaine hopes, and inioyning the most seuere order for descrying, searching, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, imprisoning, and punishing them, which euer lightly was heard of, as though they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> the only or most grieuous male factors within the Realme, and this only for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
   <p n="9">9. Soone after vpon the backe of this, came forth S. <hi>Edvvard Cooke</hi> his Maiestyes At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneyes<note place="margin">Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cookes booke against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</note> Booke, intituled by him: his <hi>Fifth Part of Reportes:</hi> which though in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and fore-front it promised more calme and mild proceeding (and so it performeth in phrase and style of writing) yet was the drift and ending therof no lesse stinging, then the Scorpions tayle it self, against all sortes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks and their Religion. And to say somewhat of it in this place, his argument or subiect was new and strange, taking vpon him to proue out of the old and ancient common lawes of<note place="margin">His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note>
      <hi>England,</hi> that the spirituall iurisdiction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Act of Parlament to the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the first yeare of her raigne, and
<pb n="9" facs="19"/>
exercised afterwardes by her in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matters, was dew vnto her, not only by vertue of that Statute, but by vigour also of the said ancient common lawes, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and practised by the olde ranke of our foregoing Kinges and Princes: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion no lesse strange and paradoxicall in wise and learned mens eares, then that was of him who diuers ages after the warres of <hi>Troy</hi> ended, and the true successe therof published by all writers throughout the world, tooke vpon him to teach the contrary, to wit, that not the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but the <hi>Troianes</hi> had the victory in that warre, and so to reuerse and contradicte whatsoeuer had byn written, taught, or receaued before.</p>
   <p n="10">10. Let the histories of our Christian English Kings euen from the first conuerted <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> vnto King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight be examined whether this be so or not, and whether a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand monuments of theirs (in almost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares) doe not testify them all to haue byn of contrary iudgment, practice, sense, and beliefe (in the controuersy proposed) to that which <hi>M. Attorney</hi> by a few pieces of lawes
<pb n="10" facs="20"/>
distractedly alleadged, woulde haue men to thinke. Or if he delight (as I take him to be learned) to haue this argument more discussed (for it is both ample and important) let him<note place="margin">M. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneyes paradox of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Kings.</note> but procure licence for his Antagonist, to write and print his booke, and I doubt not but that he will quickly be answered by some of his owne profession, among whome I doe imagine that many fingers must needes itch and tickle to be doing in so aduantagious a cause: or if not, yet doe I dare assure him, that some Deuine of our side shall ioine issue with him in that point, for the<note n="*" place="margin">Novv I heare it is answered.</note> confutation of his whole drifte, and narration in those his <hi>Reportes,</hi> but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the ouerthrowing of his iniurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, wherby he would inferre, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did not belieue and acknowledge the said late Queenes Ecclesiasticall feminine authority, power, and iurisdiction in spirituall matters, was and is a traitor by the iudgment of the ancient common lawes of <hi>England,</hi> recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, helde, and practised euen vnder Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Kinges and Princes of former times.</p>
   <p n="11">11. Vnto which vntrue and improbable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, he addeth another no lesse stinging,
<pb n="11" facs="20"/>
nor better founded then the former, which is that for the foremost eleuen yeares of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, vntill she was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by <hi>Pius Quintus: No sorte of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of vvhat persvvasion soeuer in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<note place="margin">False &amp; odious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> refused to goe to the Protestantes Church</hi> (which is euidently false, both in many Puritanes and more Catholicks that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused openly in that time) and then: <hi>That v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that occasion Catholicks first began to refuse</hi> (which in like manner is false, both for that they refused before, and this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was altogeather impertinent to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall) and thirdly most iniuriously of all, he would further seeme to inferre, that such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse now, may in like manner be presumed to doe it vpon the same vndutifull minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his Maiesty. All which points doe tend to the exasperation and exulceration which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one seeth, and comming from a man of his place, roome, and neerenes in office about his Maiesty, could not but make deepe impression, and giue perhaps a great push to the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table precipitation of those vnfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that soone after ensued.</p>
   <p n="12">
      <pb n="12" facs="21"/>12. VVhich being hapned, came forth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this other odious pamphlet of T. M. his deuised <hi>discouery</hi> (wherunto now I am forced in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler to answere) it being in it self no lesse slaunderous and iniurious, then the fact of the conspirators was wicked and grieuous to all Catholickes. The booke beareth this title: <hi>An<note place="margin">The booke of T. M. about Romish doctrine</note> exact discouery of Romish doctrine in case of Conspiracy and Rebellion:</hi> But he that shall weigh it well, shall finde it a more exacte discouery of English Ministeriall malice, in case of sycophancy and calumniation; the Authour endeauoring to ascribe that to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke and generall doctrine, which proceeded from priuate and particuler passion, as also to drawe the temerity of a few, to the hatred and condemnation of the whole. Of which ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity we shall haue occasion to speake more afterward in due place.</p>
   <p n="13">13. Soone after this pamphlet appeared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, tending all for the most part to the same end of exulceration, or driuing rather to plaine desperation, euery one adding affliction to affliction, and heaping hatred and enuy vpon them that detested &amp; bewailed the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb n="13" facs="21"/>
happened, no lesse, but much more then these insolent insultors themselues. Of this kinde I might name sundry that my self haue seene (though being out of <hi>England</hi> I may presume to haue seene the least part of such as haue byn published and set forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> this fact fell out) as namely one intituled: <hi>A Discourse of the late intended Treason;</hi> wherin the discourser beginneth with this foundation: <hi>That all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, both at home and abroad, vvere so<note place="margin">A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vvithout name of Author or truth of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> fully in possession of contented peace at the time vvhen this treason vvas plotted, as,</hi> to vse his owne wordes, <hi>no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> grudge, no invvard vvhispering of discō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment did any vvay appeare.</hi> VVhich assertion if you consider it well, and compare it with our domesticall differences in Religion, and variety of punishments laied vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sortes of men at that time (euen before this fact fell out) for the same, will seeme a very great hyperbolicall exaggeration, and ouerlashing: for that the penalties of Recusancy and other like molestations were as rife then as at any other time before, &amp; complaintes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes in diuers countreys no lesse pittifull.</p>
   <p n="14">
      <pb n="14" facs="22"/>14. Another like Treatise followed this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled: <hi>A true reporte of the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arraignment, and execution of the<note place="margin">Another Treatise.</note> late Traitors, imprinted by Geffery Chorl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> VVhich so raileth vpon Catholicks, and Catholicke Religion from the very beginning to the end therof, as if none of them had byn free from the fact attempted, or that their common doctrine had publickly allowed the same; whereunto this seditious libell of the minister T. M. which now I am to confute endeauoreth to beare false witnes. I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit two other most virulent and spitefull Treatises intituled: <hi>Pagano-Papismus,</hi> and <hi>The picture of a Papist;</hi> in which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note place="margin">Two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bookes.</note> wherin all our auncestors both liued and died from the beginning of their Christianity vnto our daies, and so many worthy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, great Princes, and famous learned men doe professe round about vs at this day, and doe hope to be saued therby, is made worse then <hi>Paganisme,</hi> vea the horrible sinke of all <hi>damnable heresies,</hi> which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were condemned by the same Religion and Church in former ages, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
this censure sauoureth more of fury then of reason.</p>
   <p n="15">15. But to leaue of the recitall of any more bookes or pamphlets to this effect, there hath appeared further a matter of far greater importance, which is a Catalogue of new lawes suggested in this Parlament against the said Catholickes, wherin besides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heape of penall statutes made to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in precedent times, diuers new are proposed for an addition and aggrauation of their Calamities, far more rigorous (if they<note n="*" place="margin">Now they are passed.</note> passe) then the former; which being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by forreine people doe make the state of English Catholickes vnder Protestant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement to seeme vnto them much more miserable and intolerable, then that of the <hi>Ievves</hi> vnder any sorte of Christian Princes, or that of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or other Christians vnder the <hi>Turke,</hi> or <hi>Persian;</hi> or that of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subiectes vnder the <hi>Polonians, Svvecians, Moscouians,</hi> and other such Nations: so as all this tendeth as yow see (and as before we haue noted) to more desperate disunion of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and exasperation of hartes.</p>

Only I must confesse, that in two mens writings I finde more moderation, then in any of the rest; who yet being more interessed in the late grieuous designed delict, then any of the other that write therof, had most cause to be prouoked against the delinquents The first is his Maiesties speach both in his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Court of Parlament. In the former he professeth <hi>to distinguish betvveene all others, calling themselues Catholicks, &amp; the Authors of detestable treason, and<note place="margin">The Princely modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty in his speach.</note> that by good experience he vvas so vvell persuaded of the loyalty of diuers of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>, as himselfe.</hi> And in the second, his Maiesty speaking in Parlament, distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed betweene different sortes of Catholicks, allowing to the one sort both the opinion of loyalty and possibility of saluation, <hi>detesting in that point</hi> (to vse his Highnes wordes) <hi>the cruelty of the Puritanes, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it vvorthy of fier, that vvill admit no saluation to any Papist:</hi> VVhich is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Princely moderate meaning, not
<pb n="17" facs="23"/>
to condemne the whole for a part: though in our sense the distinction vsed by his Maiesty in that place of some Catholicks <hi>that holde some pointes of our Religion, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that holde all, cannot stand.</hi> For that we accompt them not for Catholicks at all (nor may wee) that holde not all, but a part, for that <hi>Catholicum</hi> is <hi>secundum<note place="margin">VVhat is Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S.

this late odious accident fallen out by the temerity of a few, as the world knoweth.</p>
   <p n="18">18. The second example of some mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before mentioned, (or at least wise meant) was my L. of <hi>Salisburies</hi> answere<note place="margin">My Lord of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury his booke.</note> to <hi>Certeine scandalous papers, as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> them; which though being written in the time and occasion they were, the answerer wanteth not his stinges that pearce euen to the quicke: yet supposing the pretended iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offered by that fond menacing letter, and the condition of men in his place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not accustomed to beare or dissemble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations of that kind, all may be called moderate that is not extreme: though for the letter it self (if any such were) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume so much of his Lordships wisedome and prudence, as he could hardly deeme or suspect any Catholicke to be so mad, as to write such a franticke commination, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it came from the forge of some such other, as togeather with the blowe to be giuen therby to all Catholickes, had furthermore a desire to drawe forth from his L. the answere,

therby to see and try his style, and to that end gaue him so vrging an occasion, as by his friendes is thought that in the conueniency of reason and honour, he coulde not well omit to accept therof as he did, and performed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise in such manner, as might be expected at his L. handes; to wit, as himself writeth of his Maiesties speach in the Parlament, <hi>Euery line declaring the vvorkeman.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="19">19. Only I may not let passe to note by the way, that in two points of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, touched by him of the Popes authority, concerning Princes and the lawfulnes of Equiuocation in certaine cases, as they are matters not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining<note place="margin">Against my Lord of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries Deuine.</note> properly to his faculty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: so must I thinke that his Deuine did somewhat mistake, or misinforme him therin. For of the first, thus he writeth: <hi>that he hath byn a long time sory, that some cleere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Papall authority hath not byn made by some publicke and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue sentence orthodoxall &amp;c.</hi> He addeth further this reason of his desire: <hi>That not only those Princes vvhich acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Superiority might be secured
<pb n="21" facs="25"/>
from feares and iealosies of continuall treasons and bloudy Assassinates against their persons, but those Kings also vvhich doe not approue the same, &amp; yet vvould faine reserue a charitable opinion of their subiectes, might knovv hovv farre to repose themselues in their fidelity in ciuill obedience, hovvsoeuer they see them deuided from them in point of conscience &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="20">20. To the former clause touching his L. desire to haue the matter defined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, his Deuine might easely haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that among Catholicke people the matter is cleare, and sufficiently defined, and declared in all pointes wherin there may be any doubt concerning this affaire. As for<note place="margin">The first question about authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer Princes.</note> example in three thinges question may be made: first whether any authority were left by Christ in his Church and Christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to restraine or represse, censure or iudge any exorbitant and pernicious excesse of Great men, States or Princes, or that he had left them remediles wholy by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority? In which case as in other
<pb n="22" facs="26"/>
common-wealthes that are not Christian, all Philosophers, law-makers, Senatours, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, Historiographers, and other sortes of soundest wisedome, prudence, and experience, either Iew or Gentile, haue from the beginning of the world concurred in this; that God and nature hath left some sufficient authority in euery common wealth, for the lawfull, and orderly redressing of those euilles, euen in the highest persons. Nor did euer Philosopher of name, or law-maker hitherto deny this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as founded in the very law of nature, nations, and reason it selfe.</p>
   <p n="21">21. So when Christ our Sauiour came to found his common-wealth of Christians in farre more perfection then other states had byn established before, subiecting temporall thinges to spirituall, according to the degree of their natures, endes, and eminencies, and appointing a supreme vniuersall Gouernour in the one, with a generall charge to looke to all his sheepe, without exception of great or small, people or potentates: vpon these suppositions (I say) all Catholicke learned men do ground, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> euer grounded, that in
<pb n="23" facs="26"/>
Christian common-wealthes, not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said ordinary authority is left, which euery other state and Kingdome had by God and nature to preserue and protect themselues in the cases before laid downe; but further also for more sure, and orderly proceeding therin, that the supreme care, iudgment, direction and censure of this matter was left princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by Christ our Sauiour vnto the said supreme Gouernour, and Pastour of his Church and common-wealth. And in this there is no difference in opinion or beliefe betweene any sorte of Catholickes whatsoeuer (so they be Catholickes) though in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cases, diuersity of persons, time, place, cause, and other circumstances, may moue some diuersity of opinions. And thus much of the first question.</p>
   <p n="22">22. The second may be about the manner<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond questiō.</note> how this authority, or in what sorte it was giuen by Christ to his said supreme Pastour, whether directly or indirectly, immediatly or by a certaine consequence. As for example, whether Christ, as he gaue the generall charge of his sheepe to <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his Successours
<pb n="24" facs="27"/>
directly and immediatly in spirituall matters, by that commission three times repeated in S. Iohn. <hi>Pasce oues meas;</hi> which wordes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, according to Catholicke exposition, not only authority to feed, but to gouerne also, direct, restraine, cure, represse, and correct, when need is, as we see it doth appertaine to a temporall sheepheardes office: so whether with this commission in spirituall affaires, our Sauiour gaue also immediatly and directly, the charge and ouersight of temporalities in like manner, or rather indirectly and by a certaine consequence: that is to say, that when the gouernment of spirituall affaires, to wit, of soules to their eternall blisse and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is so letted, or impugned by any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall gouernours, as the said spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission cannot be executed without redresse or remedy; in such cases, and not otherwise, the said supreme pastour to haue authority to proceed also against the said temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, for defence and preseruation of his spirituall charge. Of which question the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonistes doe commonly defend the first part, but Catholicke Deuines for the most part the
<pb n="25" facs="27"/>
second: but both partes fully agree, that there is such an Authority lefte by Christ in his Church, for remedy of vrgent cases, for that otherwise he should not haue sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the necessity therof. So as this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the manner maketh no difference at all in the thing it selfe.</p>
   <p n="23">23. The third question may be about the<note place="margin">The third questiō.</note> causes, for which this authority may be vsed, as also the forme of proceeding to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therin; wherabout there are so many particularities to be considered, as are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for this place: only it is sufficient for Catholicke men to know, that this may not be done without iust cause, graue and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent motiues, and due forme also of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by admonition, preuention, interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and other like preambles, prescribed by Ecclesiasticall Canons to be obserued, wherby my Lordships doubtes of feares, and ielosies <hi>of continuall treasons, and bloudy assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinates</hi> may iustly be remoued. For that this authority doth not only not allow any such wicked, or vnlawfull attemptes of priuate men, but doth also expressely and publickly
<pb n="26" facs="28"/>
condemne the same and the doctrine therof, as may appeare not only by the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>VVicklifs</hi> wicked article, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <hi>of Constance,</hi> wherin he affirmed: <hi>That<note place="margin">Sess. 15.</note> it vvas lavvfull for euery priuate man to kill any Prince vvhome he held to be a Tyrant,</hi> but also by like condemnation of <hi>Caluin, Beza, Ottoman, Bucchanan, Knox, Goodman,</hi> and others of that sect, who hold and practice in effect the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>VVickliffe,</hi> concerning Princes, if not worse, as shall more largely and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly be declared afterward in the first and fourth Chapters of this Treatise. And this I desire may satisfy his Lordship for the present, vntill we come to the foresaid places where better occasion in this kind will be offered.</p>
   <p n="24">24. As for the second point touched by his Lordship about the doctrine of <hi>Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
      <note place="margin">About the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> ambiguity of speach, amphibology, or mentall reseruation, in certaine cases law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (which doctrine his Lordship termeth <hi>strange, and grosse, and that it teareth in sunder all the bandes of humane
<pb n="27" facs="28"/>
conuersation)</hi> for that I am to handle this matter more largely and particularly in the ensuing Chapters of this booke, especially from the fourth forward (the whole bulke of our aduersaries calumniations consisting in these two pointes of Rebellion and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation) I will heere make answere to his Lordship, as to a man of science and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that I maruaile greatly, how he can thinke <hi>that doctrine to be strange,</hi> which is so ordinary and vsually to be seene in all the bookes of Catholicke Deuines for the space of these three or foure hundred yeares, by confession of his owne writers: how also he can tearme it <hi>grosse,</hi> that the greatest wittes of Christendome, for so long at least, haue held for learned, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not only vpon euident groundes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nature, equity, and iustice in diuers cases (and for such allowed throughout all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunales of Christendome, both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill) but warranted also by authority of many expresse examples of Holy Scriptures and Fathers, and in some cases so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for auoiding the sinne of lying, periury,
<pb n="28" facs="29"/>
discouering of secrettes, iniuring our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and other such inconueniences, as if I should heere set downe the said particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both concerning secrecy or safty of him that is forced to equiuocate (as afterward I shall doe in conuenient place) I presume his<note place="margin">The law fulnes, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatiō.</note> Lordship as so great a <hi>common-vvealthes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> would allow therof with due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as iust and necessary, and recall that part of his censure wherin he saith: <hi>That it teareth in sunder all the bandes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conuersation,</hi> especially if he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we doe except from the licence of Equiuocation, the common conuersation of men in contractes, bargaines, and other like affaires, wherby any dammage or preiudice may grow to another man, and much more in matters appertaining to the cleare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest profession of our faith. And thus much for this place, the refidue afterward.</p>
   <p n="25">25. And now hauing spoken all this by way<note place="margin">The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ensuing booke against T.
