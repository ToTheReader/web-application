      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ntiquity informes us, in the most
flourishing state of <hi>Rome,</hi> of an
Order of the <hi>Candidati,</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
because habited in white ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
betokning <hi>Innocence,</hi> and
those of the noblest Citizens, who in that garbe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the streets with humble lookes, and submisse ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
thereby to insinuate themselves into the
grace of the people, being ambitious after honour and
Office. Great Lord, it fareth not so with You, who
though for inward Candor and sincerity, You may
compare with the best of them, yet have beene so far
from affecting such popularity, that though You in
Your great Modesty would willingly have evaded
it; yet some places by importunity, and this Your
present Praetorship hath by a generall suffrage, and
the unanimous harmony of a free Election, beene
conferd upon You.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Neither can I omit the happinesse of Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Father, remarkable in three most fortunate
Sonnes: the one, for many yeares together, Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Metropolitane of all
<hi>England:</hi> another, a reverend Father in God,
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury:</hi> as memorable for his learned
Workes and Writings, as the other for his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
government in the Church, and Counsell in
State. And now lately Your Honour'd selfe, the
Lord Maior of this Metropolis, the famous City
<hi>London:</hi> In which, and of which, as you are now
<hi>Maximus,</hi> so it is expected you shall prove <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
Grave Sir, it is a knowne Maxime, that the
honour which is acquired by Vertue, hath a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assurance: nor blame my boldnesse, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to prompt Your memory in what You have long
studied: The life of a Magistrate is the rule and
square whereby inferior persons frame their carriage
and deportment, who sooner assimulate themselves to
their Lives than their Lawes, which Lawes if not
executed are of no estimation. But I cease further to
trouble Your Lordship, leaving you to Your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
charge, with that of the Poet,
