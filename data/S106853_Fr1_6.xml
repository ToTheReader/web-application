   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Allant minded young Gentlemen, and good countriemen in generall, which haue not yet marched vnder <hi>Mars</hi> his Colours, nor knowne the parts incident to his followers, for your instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions haue these discourses bene principally penned: the which although they be but rough, &amp; not polished with schoole termes, yet happily not so barraine, but you may reape some good fruit from them, being read, and noted with due regard▪ to your behoofe (perhaps) in these behouefull times. I am not ignorant that sundry haue treated vpon the like subiect, and all to good end: but yet they obserue not all one method, neither I my self (happily) such as euery one wold wish. It is somewhat hard to please few, but harder to please many, and none can please all: although mine intent hath bene (as others no doubt, the like) both to please and profit the most. These appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching times do require such vnpleasant matter, yet the necessitie is such: and therefore to be regarded. Accept it friendly, as I haue penned it willingly, so shall I hold my selfe both rewarded and satisfied.</p>
