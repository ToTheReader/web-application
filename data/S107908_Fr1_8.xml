   <head>¶ To the Christian <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as in one househould or familie (gentle Reader) the Chyldren, begotten betwene one Father and one Mother: doe differ one from another, aswell, in proporcion of body, as in wyt, disposition; and maners: Euen so, men of one facultie, in sundry things, be of sun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dry inuencions, iudgementes, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions: aswell Diuines, Lawiers, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, as Phisiciōs, no maruail ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, if others. So hard it is for any man, be it neuer so frēdly intēded: neuer so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously laboured: neuer so profitable, for, the wele publike: to set forth any thing, for al mens liking, that euen most of the wisest sort (as many men think) set forth nothing by printing: bicause, many now a daies are giuē, to the searching out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (if they cā) to blot him, with the lest matter (if there bee no greater) and let the common profyt, then too seeke the thinge that may all men benefyte, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="6"/>the same to commend, or therto too adde any credite.</p>
   <p>These, and such lyke causes, haue letted many (as I deme) frō the attempting of this (howsoeuer it be) which I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, of Buckstons benifite: aduen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turing rather for my part, to be stong of the Drones, then to leaue the good hony vnsought and to be barked at, with such vnkind curs, then to leaue the Master of the house helples: trusting that the wise, Graue, Learned, Curteouse, &amp; Louing sort, wil accept the endeuour of him, who asmuch as in him lieth (for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tyme) doth seeke, how he may best profit the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall people of God, and in speciall, hys owne countrymen that bee vexed with such greuous sicknesses, as they despaire of remedy, by any other meanes.</p>
   <p>Galen, whē he came first to Rome, sent for by Marcus Aurel. Willing his Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, that he shuld honorably furnishe him with men, money, horse, &amp; municion as very noblie he did: for that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous greatly of his consayle. Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus his sonne being very sicke of a feuer,
<pb facs="6"/>the which at the first sight, hee presaged (for that the Crisis so prognosticated, a knowledge by him throughly labored, as he that was most expert in phisicke) that he should haue his fit no more: whereat, the Phisicions of the Emperours hyghe councell, meruayled, &amp; whē they saw the effect, greatly disdayned (for such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had not studied) where they should haue louingly embraced him, and highly haue cōmended him, for Tagalti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>us saieth, the maners that to Phisicions belonged, are that thei be of gentle enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynement, curteouse, &amp; friendly toward such as be of their own professiō, in greek termed Philateiras. But what did hee? leaue his well dooing for all their enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? no truly. So much was hee gyuen the vniuersall world to profyt, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly proceeded forward in all good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as by his workes made there, both against Erasistratus, cōcerning letting of blood: and against Thessalus Trali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, about the healing of vlcers, maye appeare: prouing &amp; reprouinge, by most waighty arguments, &amp; best authorities,
<pb facs="7"/>al that he did not waying the disdain of a fewe, so that he might profyt all, as no dout he hath al the world. Let Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus (&amp; all other vayn practisers do what they can) with his fyre work, of three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, of salt, Brimstone, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer, blowing the coles vnto ashes, and stilling til they haue no glasses, as wyse as geese, as reasonable as apes, as trim as Colyers, and as riche as newe shorne sheepe.</p>
   <p>Now seeing Galen, in whō was heaped as in a grainard: all knowledge both philosophicall, &amp; phisicall, was enuyed, disdained, backbyted, and yet of some is: what shal I think to go scotfre, that am so far inferiour vnto him, as is the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, vnto the maister? No no, therefore I will arme my head with patience: and my harte with a cleare Conscience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing before GOD: and men, (which thorow the enuiousnes of the time I am driuē vnto) that this, that I haue done, I haue done neyther of a proud mynd, ambicious desire, or ouerwening in my selfe, but of a very feruent zeale, to the
<pb facs="7"/>preseruation of health, and mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of lyfe: bycause I sawe so many repaire thither, without al order. By meanes whereof, some went away very sick, that came thither indyfferent well. Some neuer a whit the better: whiche if they had had good counsail, might. And some, more by hap then by cunning: as it dyd them no good, so dyd it them no harme.</p>
   <p>These things wayed, I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with my self, of many things dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whether it were better, to let passe, as other wiser, &amp; better lerned thē I had done such matters, or to procede therein. The which, whē I had attēpted, more and more I saw was too bee sayde, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue gone no further: thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene dout and despair, hapned to come vnto me, of the lerned some, &amp; other of the gentility, wise &amp; expert that feared God, loued their country: and hearing that I had begon suche a matter of Buckstone, as I had of Bath: instātly desired mee, to goe forward, affirming, I should doo a gratefull deed too the common weale
<pb facs="8"/>of my natiue coūtry, &amp; that for the north parts, &amp; West: aswel as the South: yea &amp; if it were not so well done as some others of more wisedome, learning, &amp; experience could, (as I think of my self it is not) yet bicause it should encourage some other, if they saw myne not sufficient to amende (as it is easier then to begin) that which I haue rudely rouded ouer. Albeit al that which I haue done, is collected out of the best writers in phisick: and for these .xiiii. yeres &amp; more, proued. Trusting it will be wel accepted, seeing the profit is thyne, &amp; the labor myne. But if ther be any so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionated to Rhetorique, that vnlesse they find a moulhil made a mountayne, or an Emet, an Elephāt, think the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnperfect let them consider that.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Non cupit ornari, cupit, &amp;c.</hi> Or if, they suppose knowledge nothinge worthe, vttered in their own language. Thē I must nedes say, they shall find this of Buckstons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyt, &amp; also Bathes aide vnperfect. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit, of this if they consider, they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fynde whether a thing briefely and plainly taught, bee better, or a thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<pb facs="8"/>&amp; intricate: and whether a thinge familiar, or a thing straunge be easiest to iudge of, what neede many wordes? If a longe discourse had more needed, then a short: Hippocrates had not written his Aphorisines, nor Galen Ars parua: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they writen in Greeke, when as all Grece vnderstoode Greeke, aswell as they, or we in England english. But had deuised some new tongue: a matter of no great labour: for the Drawcabiō tongue of fiue yeares standing, as it was in a day inuented. So was it in a weeke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: &amp; is with some, for their pleasures in daily vse. But these toies, were far frō their meaning, &amp; so I dout not, but they be now from the wyse, or els, the guide of the soule, Gods woord, had not bin in our owne tongue vttered, nor of Paule, so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And therfore, if with the matter any be offended, let thē be offended with the best learned, whose example herein I haue followed, and out of whom this is collected. If the phrase like them not, I wishe them to thinke, so many men, so many wittes: so many styles, so many
<pb facs="9"/>deuises, as you haue hard. If the style be to playne, I would haue them to remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether heuy things be easier of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, or light: and briefly to conclude, whether their own familiar spech: their own lawes: or the Romains be better, &amp; easyer, too Iudge of. Too conclude, if the matter be best whiche the approued writers, obserue &amp; affirme: then I dare say, this is not all ill. If the phrase be best that is most playn, thē this is not worst. If the style or endyting be best which cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the matter: then this is not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to bee disallowed. In fyne, if the mother tongue be most meete for hir own children, and easyest to be vnderstanded, then this in our own, you will affirme, is not to bee abandoned. So that I wil thus ende.</p>
