   <head>A Prayer to be said before
a man goes to his
nightly rest.</head>
   <p>O Gracious Lord
God heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the keeper
and preseruer of all that
come vnto thee for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
I haue been through
thy great mercie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
kept, preserued,
defended, fed, sustained,
and relieued this day, now
come to an end; and now
as the night succeedeth
the day, and the darkenes
the light; so I knowe O
Lord, that death will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
my life, and the
graue my bed.</p>
   <p>Lord, thou madest in
the beginning, light and
<pb facs="24"/>
darknes, night &amp; day, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
&amp; euening, and all to
thine own glorie, &amp; to the
vse of wretched man, who
in the beginning turned
his light into darkenesse, &amp;
that darkenesse hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed
al that haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of his corrupt seed;
among whom O Lord, I
am so bemisted and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with that originall
darkenes, as I cannot see,
nor truely conceiue the
light of thy most sacred
word, without that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
light, shining from
thine illuminating Spirit.</p>
   <p>Thou madest two lights
O Lord, to endure for
euer, the Sun to gouerne
the day, and the Moone
to giue light in the night;
<pb facs="25"/>
yet doe not these lights
O Lord, direct our feete
in the wayes of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nor our pathes in
obedience, but rather lead
vs to the occasions to sin;
but it is the supernaturall
light O Lord, that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the brightnesse
of thy louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that directeth
aright those that are thy
children of the light.</p>
   <p>By this light O Lord,
guide me, that the night of
ignorance ouer shadowe
me not from beholding
thy louing countenance,
which is more pretious &amp;
more sweete vnto me, then
all earthly delights.</p>
   <p>The day-light wherein
I should onely followe
<pb facs="25"/>
with godly diligence in
my calling, &amp; to serue thee,
turneth into the darkenes
of my minde without thy
spirituall light: how much
more will the darkenesse
of the night miscarrie my
corrupt hart, into idle and
vngodly thoughts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
by the temptations
of the Prince of darkenes,
when thy light faileth me?</p>
   <p>For such O Lord, is the
nature of my polluted
heart, that it neuer resteth
to infuse euill imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into my mind; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in my night wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
and in my sleepe to
trouble me, with sundrie
euil &amp; vngodly dreames &amp;
wicked phantasies; show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby the fruites of
<pb facs="26"/>
my sinfull nature.</p>
   <p>Therefore gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I finding in my selfe,
&amp; thou knowing mine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
better then my
selfe, I come in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
praying thee to
assist me with thy grace,
that I may conuert my
heart from the euils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it is enclined, and
onely incline and frame it
to the sincere seruice of, &amp;
obedience to thee; and to
dedicate my <hi>mind, will</hi> and
<hi>affections,</hi> in my night wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
either to meditate
of thy word, or in making
my faithfull prayers vnto
thee.</p>
   <p>I cannot O Lord, through
the weakenesse of my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte
nature subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="26"/>
cōpetent rest &amp; sleep;
yet I know thou slumbrest
not nor sleepest: but with
thee the day and night are
alike light, and in thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
and loue, hast an
eye ouer all that are thine
whether they sleep or wake.</p>
   <p>Giue therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
O Lord, vnto thy
heauenly watchmen to
keepe me, and all that I
haue, from danger this
night: so will I lay mee
downe vnder the shadowe
of thy protecting winges
to take my rest this night;
faithfully cōmending my
soule and body, and all
that belong vnto me, into
thy most powerfull and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
tuition; so shall I
not feare what Satan or
<pb facs="27"/>
any malicious instrument
of his shall practise or plot
against me.</p>
   <p>And in this assurance O
Lord, confirme my faith
from night to day, and
from day to night; that all
the dayes and nights of
my life, may be rightly
spent in a holy and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
conuersation, to thy
glorie and mine own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
vnto the end of all
my nights and dayes,
through Iesus Christ my
Sauiour and Redeemer.
Amen.</p>
   <closer>Lord, encrease and confirme
my faith, this night and
euermore.</closer>
