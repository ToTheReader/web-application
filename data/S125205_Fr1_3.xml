      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Heras (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine out of the Prophet Ioel was to haue come foorth the last sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<note place="margin">That this Prophecie fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and these our daies mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velous well.</note> though (I know not how) it hath beene stayed till this praesent: by this meanes it cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that now I am iustly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned to say sumwhat unto thee, not only of the Treatise it selfe, but also of this late publishing of it. Concerning the Treatise it selfe, although it be out of the Prophet Ioel, who was sent of God to his people of old, and about such things as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a speciall estate of theirs thén: yet doth it so fitly agree with ús also now, and with the waies that are most common and rife among us that the selfe same Prophet may seeme as much to have beene preserved for ús against this time that now we are in, as he was before sent unto others to speake unto thém. For we also are found in the self same waies, that they were in at that praesent: and therefore hath the Lord for these few of the last yeeres in much like sort laide his hand vpon
<pb facs="5"/>us, as he did upon them, and yet also doth, in very plaine and sensible maner. But as théy were sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and could not see it, &amp; therfore turned nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord that so had laide his hand upon them: so wé likevvise at this praesent have notably beene provoked diuers waies to acknowledge the hand of God upon us, and to turne unto him, and yet notwithstanding, we have not done it, but either shame with it, or thinke it needeles to take such a course. And yet, as at that time God did but with one hand shake the rod at them, &amp; with the other held foorth special mercies vnto them, a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of religion among them, and a special deliverance from al their enimies: so at this time also we may see the Lord to observe that course toward vs, not onely laying his hand upon us, but also tendering and offering unto us, by manie good and comfortable tokens, both a further manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gospel, and a better riddance of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if so be that we can truely turn unto him. As therefore this call of the Prophet was to speciall good use unto thém to quicken them up, both to a sensible feeling of that hand of God upon them; &amp; to cast thēselves to be in a redines to receave those greater mercies at his hands likewise: even so may it be as much to our purpose, that he should nowe stir us up unto a feeling of such hands of God as are upon us; and with all diligence to sort our selves to such a course, as best may serve to take unto us those other mercies, that now of long he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, (&amp; yet doth) in so gracious maner.</p>
   <p>But it may be,
<note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> that thou wilt thinke, that I have over lightly passed over the Text of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: yeelding, as it doth, so manie good lessons; so meete for our selves, and for the daies wherein we live. But my desire was, but only to open the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto thee; and that so briefly as I could: that so being otherwise lesse incumbred, thou mightest
<pb facs="5"/>the better attend unto him. For which cause also, after everie chiefe &amp; principal division of the Text, and the opening of the Methode or order of it, I have briefly shewed, howe we may apply the same to our selves. Then also, to the end that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one may better perceive, how far foorth he may account, either of the sense that out of any part of the Text is gathered, or of the Methode whereinto it is digested, I have here set down the Text it selfe in such sort distributed, or divided into such severall portions as it is aportioned &amp; handled in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it self: noting also, in the end of every portion, in what Sections of the Treatise that portiō is hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led. A matter that many do litle need (such as have the text already, and can redily turn unto it:) &amp; yet may it be to good use to some others, &amp; (for that matter) ease them of some part of their labour. And the brieflier and plainlier that it is delivered unto thee, the better shalt thou be able to see, what it is that the Prophet doth call thee unto. Which when thou perceavest, then it remayneth, that thou cast thee self to be in a redines to answere his cal.</p>
   <p>Concerning this late publishing of it; first,
<note place="margin">Of the late publishing of it: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that yet also it cometh in seasen.</note> what was the cause of the stay with him to whō the prin ting thereof was comitted, &amp; who then did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the praesent dispatch of it, I mee self am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to say: &amp; it was much against my wil, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, as at that praesent occasion had set me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that kinde of labour for the good of others so did it likewise not well accord with that needles delay that thereof was made, when the time it selfe did so iustly require it. Insomuch that to that verie end, that is, to give it so readie a course, as to that season did appertain, both my selfe of set purpose repayred to London, and there tooke speciall order for the praesent imprinting of it. Then that it is set foorth now, although it may seeme to be sumwhat our of season, in some respect, because it relieth
<pb facs="6"/>so much on the scarcity that then was, which is in good part eased now, yet the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h is, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being better considered, there is no cause why any man neede to thinke, but that yet (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect also) it may well come not far out of season. For though the yere that now is praesent, hath brought with it (God be thanked) good store of come, which the other wanted before: yet did that other so far sinke the most mens substance at that praesent, to get them graine to their needeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that now they hardlier have wherewithall to get it, than they had then, though it bee cheaper. And so consequently that scarcitie doth as yet remaine with verie many. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er that it is eased: yet is there among us such a kinde of sickenesse at this praesent, spread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all generally, as that therein (both by the sharpenes, and strangenes of it, we may plainely perceave that it is the hand of God, and calleth us no doubt unto repentance. Again, as this our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by occasion of a famin then, called on the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple to be effectually touched therwith, &amp; with true repentance to turn to the Lord: so, because that this <hi>Admonition</hi> of mine hath likewise held the self same course, the lesse that we have yet acknowledged that hand of God, and the lesse that we thereupon did turn unto him by repentance as yet, the more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stly may it be demaunded of us, and the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> occasion hath this <hi>Admonition</hi> still to proceede, and to hold on his former course. Besides this, whereas the prophet Ioel, upon their repentance did assure them of greater mercies, both a further propagation of the Gospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>, and a notable deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from their enimies: who seeth not, but that to this end also this <hi>Admonition</hi> may now very fitly come foorth, when as all sorts have so much busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes about the aduauncement of Religion, and when
<pb facs="6"/>as there is a generall doubt of enimies also, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowne, that (for the gospel) they are not a little incensed against us? These reasons therfore moving, I have thought good, now to take some further order for the publishing of this <hi>Admonition:</hi> and therewithall to shew thee, what reasons mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me thereunto.</p>
   <p>And now what remaineth, but that,
<note place="margin">VVhat bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to take by the reading of it</note> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth call upon us, God himselfe hath nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly provoked, and our owne estate doth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: even so we addresse our selves to aunswere this gratious calling of his, in stirring up our selves to a sensible feeling of that hand of God upon us, and, in turning our selves unto him in true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Of these things I thought good a little to forewarne thee (gentle Reader): leaving thee now at thy good pleasure, to the Treatise it selfe, and wishing thee to use it to the glory of him who so lovingly calleth, and to the benefite of thy selfe whom he would in no wise have to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary: which that thou maist the better do, I humbly beseeche God to vouchsafe thee his blessing, and the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his holie spirite: and so I bid thee well to fare in Iesus Christ.</p>
