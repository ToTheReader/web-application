   <head>¶ To the Ladie <hi>Katherine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse <hi>of Suffolke.</hi>
   </head>
   <lg>
      <l>ALthough great Lady, it may seeme right strange,</l>
      <l>That I a stranger should presume thus farre,</l>
      <l>To write to you; yet as the times doe change,</l>
      <l>So are we subiect to that fatall starre,</l>
      <l>Vnder the which we were produc'd to breath,</l>
      <l>That starre that guides vs euen vntill our death.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And guided me to frame this worke of grace,</l>
      <l>Not of it selfe, but by celestiall powres,</l>
      <l>To which, both that and wee must needs giue place,</l>
      <l>Since what we haue, we cannot count it ours:</l>
      <l>For health, wealth, honour, sickenesse, death &amp; all,</l>
      <l>Is in Gods powre, which makes vs rise and fall.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And since his powre hath giuen me powre to write,</l>
      <l>A subiect sit for you to looke vpon,</l>
      <l>Wherein your soule may take no small delight,</l>
      <l>When her bright eyes beholds that holy one:</l>
      <l>By whose great wisedome, loue, and speciall grace,</l>
      <l>Shee was created to behold his face.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Vouchsafe sweet Lady, to accept these lines,</l>
      <l>Writ by a hand that doth desire to doe</l>
      <l>All seruices to you whose worth combines</l>
      <l>The worthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>st minds to loue and honour you:</l>
      <l>Whose beautie, wisedome, children, high estate,</l>
      <l>Doe all concurre to make you fortunate.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="18"/>
   <lg>
      <l>But chiefly your most honorable Lord,</l>
      <l>Whose noble virtues Fame can ne'r forget:</l>
      <l>His hand being alwayes ready to afford</l>
      <l>Help to the weake, to the vnfortunate:</l>
      <l>All which begets more honour and respect,</l>
      <l>Than <hi>Croessus</hi> wealth, or <hi>Caesars</hi> sterne aspect.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And rightly sheweth that hee is descended</l>
      <l>Of honourable <hi>Howards</hi> antient house;</l>
      <l>Whose noble deedes by former times commended,</l>
      <l>Do now remaine in your most loyall Spouse,</l>
      <l>On whom God powres all blessings from aboue,</l>
      <l>Wealth, honour, children and a worthy Loue;</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Which is more deare to him than all the rest,</l>
      <l>You being the louing Hinde and pleasant Roe,</l>
      <l>Wife of his youth, in whom his soule is blest,</l>
      <l>Fountaine from whence his chiefe delights do flow.</l>
      <l>Faire tree from which the fruit of Honor springs,</l>
      <l>Heere I present to you the King of kings:</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Desiring you to take a perfit view,</l>
      <l>Of those great torments Patience did indure;</l>
      <l>And reape those Comforts that belongs to you,</l>
      <l>Which his most painfull death did then assure:</l>
      <l>Writing the Couenant with his pretious blood,</l>
      <l>That your faire soule might bathe her in that flood.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And let your noble daughters likewise reade</l>
      <l>This little Booke that I present to you;</l>
      <l>On heauenly food let them vouchsafe to feede;</l>
      <l>Heere they may see a Louer much more true</l>
      <l>Than euer was since first the world began,</l>
      <l>This poore rich King that di'd both God and man.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="18"/>
   <lg>
      <l>Yea, let those Ladies which do represent</l>
      <l>All beauty, wisedome, zeale, and loue,</l>
      <l>Receiue this iewell from <hi>Iehoua</hi> sent,</l>
      <l>This spotlesse Lambe, this perfit patient Doue:</l>
      <l>Of whom faire <hi>Gabriel,</hi> Gods bright <hi>Mercury,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Brought downe a message from the Deitie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Here may they see him in a flood of teares,</l>
      <l>Crowned with thornes, and bathing in his blood;</l>
      <l>Here may they see his feares exceed all feares,</l>
      <l>When Heauen in Iustice flat against him stood:</l>
      <l>And loathsome death with grim and gastly look,</l>
      <l>Presented him that blacke infernall booke,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Wherein the sinnes of all the world were writ,</l>
      <l>In deepe Characters of due punishment;</l>
      <l>And naught but dying breath could cancel it:</l>
      <l>Shame, death, and hell must make the attonement:</l>
      <l>Shewing their euidence, seizing wrongful Right,</l>
      <l>Placing heau'ns Beauty in deaths darkest night.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yet through the sable Clowdes of Shame &amp; Death,</l>
      <l>His beauty shewes more clearer than before;</l>
      <l>Death lost his strength when he did loose his breath:</l>
      <l>As fire supprest doth shine and flame the more,</l>
      <l>So in Deaths ashie pale discoloured face,</l>
      <l>Fresh beauty shin'd, yeelding farre greater grace.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No Doue, no Swan, nor Iu'rie could compare</l>
      <l>With this faire corps, when 'twas by death imbrac'd;</l>
      <l>No rose, nor no vermillion halfe so faire</l>
      <l>As was that pretious blood that iuterlac'd</l>
      <l>His body, which bright Angels did attend,</l>
      <l>Waiting on him that must to Heauen ascend.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="19"/>
   <lg>
      <l>In whom is all that Ladies can desire;</l>
      <l>If Beauty, who hath bin more faire than he?</l>
      <l>If Wisedome, doth not all the world admire</l>
      <l>The depth of his, that cannot searched be?</l>
      <l>If wealth, if honour, fame, or Kingdoms store,</l>
      <l>Who euer liu'd that was possest of more?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If zeale, if grace, if loue, if pietie,</l>
      <l>If constancie, if faith, if faire obedience,</l>
      <l>If valour, patience, or sobrietie;</l>
      <l>If chast behauiour, meekenesse, continence,</l>
      <l>If iustice, mercie, bountie, charitie,</l>
      <l>Who can compare with his Diuinitie?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Whose vertues more than thoughts can apprehend,</l>
      <l>I leaue to their more cleere imagination,</l>
      <l>That will vouchsafe their borrowed time to spend</l>
      <l>In meditating, and in contemplation</l>
      <l>Of his rare parts, true honours faire prospect,</l>
      <l>The perfect line that goodnesse doth direct.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And vnto you I wish those sweet desires,</l>
      <l>That from your perfect thoughts doe daily spring,</l>
      <l>Increasing still pure, bright, and holy fires,</l>
      <l>Which sparkes of pretious grace, by faith doe spring:</l>
      <l>Mounting your soule vnto eternall rest,</l>
      <l>There to liue happily among the best.</l>
