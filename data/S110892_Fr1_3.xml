Yet you may wonder how my young yeeres dare venture to instruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Brutus</hi> soliciting <hi>Statilius</hi> to adhere in the Conspiracy against <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> was answered by him, that he allowed the
<pb facs="4"/> enterprize to bee just, but disallowed of the men that should performe it My subject you will not dislike: but that I a yong Citizen should treat of it, perhaps you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. You may say to me as <hi>Isaak</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> how hast thou found it so soon my Sonne? The Learned lament the losse of those Bookes which <hi>Brutus</hi> wrote of vertue, because they account it a goodly thing to learne the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of such as understand the practise well; they and
<pb facs="4"/> onely they are fit to write of affaires, whose owne hands have bin imployed in the conduct of them. That I have manag'd bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, may authorize me to write of it: but since I have not done it long, may make you question whether my Writings Wilbe worth the reading That <hi>Augustus</hi> which had been supreame Iudge of the world when he was but nineteene yeeres old, would have another to be thirty before he should bee thought a competent
<pb facs="5"/> Iudge of a Cottage or Farme. Yet I hope I need not aske leave to thinke that hee who at twenty yeeres hath not given some token of his suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, wil hardly doe it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it is a true French Proverb,

      <hi>Hanibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> lived the greater part of
