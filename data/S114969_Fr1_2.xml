   <head type="sub">¶The word of God to Micha of Maresha in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dayes of Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tham, Achas, Iehiskiah kings of Iuda, whyche he dyd see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Samaria and Ierusalē.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do nede no newe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. We do nede no mo Prophecyes. We do nead no mo Miracles, sygnes, or tokens, whyche nowe do lyue in these latter dayes: if we will call olde thynges to memorye: neither of wee wyll beleue the olde hystoryes reported by Moyses, and the terryble threatnynges of the Prophets. Could wee beleue if the greateste miracles of raysinge the deade, to speake amongs vs were wroughte in oure dayes (as Christe oure sauyoure saythe too the ryche glotten.) Wherfore suffer me, I beseeche the, too renewe olde thynges wrytten by thys Prophete Micha, the mooste earneste rebuker of vyce in hys tyme, and the mooste dylygente watch man to warne bothe of good and euyl,
<pb facs="3"/> for to come vpō his people, and if so be that the wordes of this olde truthe, do chayfe your olde sores in thys perilous tyme, wherein all olde euyls seme too haue dysgysed them selues wyth new vysers: rather suffer them to be ripped to the hearde coore then to spurne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentlye against the prycke, to striue agaynst the streame. For the time is at hande by the vnchaungeable appoynt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente of the euerliuinge Lord &amp; moste myghtye Iudge, when euery man shal be tryed and Iudged, approued of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by the thoughtes of hys hearte, by the woordes of hys mouthe, and by the fruyts of his owne imaginacions.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="i"/> Therfore this diligent watchman, warneth especiallye of this iudgment in the entrye into his prophecye, in the fyrste Chapter sayinge: that the Lord hym selfe wyll come downe moste ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybly to the wycked, &amp; the mountains shall melte, the valeis shall vade and vanish like waxe before the firy flame.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".ii"/> And in the seconde chapter he crieth forthe woo, dampnacion, and the sore vengaunce of God agaynste the vaine thoughtes and Imaginacions of thee mighty men of the world, against their wicked workes and threatenynges of
<pb facs="3"/> the true Prophetes.</p>
   <p>In the thyrde Chapter he rypeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iii."/> more neare the coare of theyr crueltye and extorsion. He vttereth the flattery of their chaplaines (as we do cal them) the false prophetes, flearynge vppon them for aduauntage and bolsterynge them vp in wyckednesse, the lynkynge together of the Iudges and high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycers theyr brybery and auarice, and for theyr wyckednes he threatneth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desolacion to their cities.</p>
   <p>In the .iiii. he promiseth a kingdom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iiii."/> farre contrarye to thys kyngedome to come vppon earthe, full of knowledge quietnes, and peace, which is the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of Messiah, wherin all the chosē Iacob shal be restored to theyr honour promysed, and theyr ennemyes vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye destroyed.</p>
   <p>In the .v. he threatneth the desolaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="v."/> of Ierusalem, the robbers dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (as Iherome dothe translate) and immediatlye adioyneth a large &amp; plain promise of Messiah oure sauiour to be borne in Bethlē, a despised vyllage, he declareth hym to be both God &amp; man, and sheweth howe he shall fede Iacob and be his peace. But he shall fede the land of Nimroth with their ennemies
<pb facs="4"/> wyth theyr owne swearde poyntes.</p>
   <p>In the sixte he contendeth wyth the people in the person of God for their ingratitude, teachynge the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe of God to stande in iudgmente, mercye, and the reuerēce of the sacrate magesty of the almyghtie. He detesteth in the parson of God al dysceytful dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng and promiseth worthy recompens and iust rewardes for al euyll doers.</p>
   <p>In the .vii. and last Chapter, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet bewaileth the skarsitye of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> good, the smal truste of worldely frendeshyp, he teacheth paciēce, he geueth comfort, he promyseth delyueraunce to fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iacob, to the shame and confusy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God hys ennemyes, and the land and prayse of God hys greate mercye &amp; truthe. Amen,</p>
   <p>This haue we heare in this Prophet holesome doctryne for al ages. For the spyryte of God seeth from time to time contynuallye oure iniquytyes, and stry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth euermore there agaynste, No hyll is so hyghe, no valleye so low, that he se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth not. He shaketh the foundacyōs of the earthe, when he rebuketh the world in the rygoure of his wrath.</p>
   <p>Let vs therfore remember the olde world before vs plaged for synne, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="4"/> for theyr wyckednes, and feare the fyre of goddes wrath, threatned by the Prophetes, to be kyndled in these laste tymes, to the euerlastynge destruccion of all euyll doers, who wyth the deuyll and his aungels shal haue aworme, the whyche shal hereafter gnaw and grate theyr conscience for euer, and a fyry tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente whyche shall neuer be quenched whereof our Prophet warneth the wyc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked worlde, threatnyng woo and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacyon wyth feruente spryt and sorow of hearte, brastynge forth into teares, yellynge and syghinge for the euils he dyd saye towardes them. Micha. i.</p>
   <p>For thys Prophet Micha semeth to be another Eliah feruent in spyryt and zeloous for the glory of God, he was of the pryncelye trybe of Iuda, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquaynted wyth the pryuy prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of the potentates &amp; prynces, he did wel inoughe know theyr ydle deuyses, theyr vayne imagynacyons: and cold es<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye the lynkynge together of the highe officers and Iudges. He liued in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of Esaiah, Hoseah, and Amos, vnder these .iii. kinges. Iothana Achas &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah. A man of suche an hygh reuela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon that Esaiah dare alledg the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste mysteryes of his hole prophecy of
<pb facs="5"/> the spiritual kyngedome of Christe and of the greate tranquyllytye vnder him by the same woordes that thys manne of God Micha hadde spoken theym. It shalbe in the laste daies, and so forth Esa .ii. Hieremiah also alledgeth hym by name sayinge, Micha of Marescha was a Prophet in the dayes of Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah and saythe to al the people of Iuda. Thus saythe the Lorde of hostes, Sion shalbe plowed lyke the feilde, and Ihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem shallbe an heape of stones, and the hyll of the house of the Lord shalbe an hyghe woode. Hierem .xxvi. and the came is red the thyrde Chapter of oure Prophet worde for word.</p>
   <p>We do reade of ii. Prophetes of this name. The fyrst is named Micha the sō of Iemla an Israelite, whom Achab did saye that he had onlye lefte one a lyue amonges all the Prophets of the lord, but I do hate hym (saythe he) for he ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer Prophecyed good towardes me .iii. kynges .xxii. The other is of Iuda (our prophet) which liued almost .ii. C. yeres after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first Micha. He was borne in a ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty called Maresha, which is in the trybe of Iuda. Iosua .xv. Hys propheci is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to al cities &amp; cuntries, but vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rusalē &amp; to Samaria, he chiefly vttereth
<pb facs="5"/> hys threatninges because there he dyd knowe and see theyr wyckednes to bee great, amongs whom he dyd see cruelti, extorsiō, tyranni, couetousnes, auarice, ambicion, the cōtempt of God his true religion, Idolatry, and lyke abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciōs to raygne (not onely vnpunyshed) but by the chiefe Lordes, greatest Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and Prynces, practysed, vsed, and frequented. In hys tyme both these .ii. kingdōs wer greuousli vexed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wars w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out, &amp; treasōs within themselues. They wer polluted &amp; defyled wyth Idolatry. So far geuē ouer to mindes reprobate, that forgetting al true worship of God and al natural inclinacion, they did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice theyr owne children by fyre vnto Baal. These wycked tymes wherein he liued vnder Iotham, Achas, and Ichis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, ar set forth in the .iiii. booke of the Kynges .xv.xvi. and .xvii. Chapters.</p>
   <p>As for Samaria, it was geuen ouer to al wyckednes. zacharia the wycked &amp; Idolatrous kyng raigning but .vi. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, was traytorously slaine by Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, whych Sellum vsurping y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crowne but one moneth, was slayne by Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen, which also slew al the enhabitants of Thapsa and most cruelly murthered al the women wyth chyld, &amp; rypte theyr
<pb facs="6"/> bellyes, and tyrannouslye wyth taxes &amp; trybutes dyd vexe all hys subiectes, to mayntaine hys wyckednes, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth our Prophet to saye, that they dyd flay theyr skyns of theyr backs and the flesh of theyr boanes. Then Phacea his sonne raygned after hym one yeare, as wycked as hys father, and they al wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the wycked wayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, whyche set vp the golden calfe. Thefore were they geuen ouer to myndes reprobate wyth gredy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to fulfyl al theyr wycked lustes.</p>
   <p>In the second yeare of the raygne of Phacea the son of Manahea, Phacea the sonne Romalia wrought treason a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaynst hym, slewe hym, and vsurped the crowne and departed not from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes of hys predecessors kynges of Samaria. Vnder him Theglathphal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lassar the king of Assiria, inuadeth Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile, and carieth away captiue the trybe of Nephthalim. Agayn Osee the son of Hela wrought treasō against this Pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cea, slew hym, &amp; vsurped his crowne, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaīst whō Salmanasser moueth war, do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth beseige his chiefe city Samaria, ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth &amp; destroieth it, &amp; so leadeth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> .x. tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes captiue into Assyria. Thus w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wars &amp; wickednes was Samaria destroied, &amp;
<pb facs="6"/> as oure Prophete warned in hys tyme, broughte to an heape of stones whyche myght haue caused Ierusalem to haue taken heede to his threatnings. But no warninge can serue the wicked and stif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>necked. For Iotham the king of Iuda and Ierusalem in manye thyngs, a mā praise worthye (thoughe he did se many of these great plages fal vpō Samaria for theyr Idolatry) yet did he suffer his people to sacrifice in the hill altars, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to God his holy commaundemēt. As for Achas kynge of Ierusalem. He was worsse thē wycked Achab kyng of Samaria, for beside al other abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions he dyd offer hys sonne in fire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baal, after the maner of the heathen Cananees, &amp; spoyled y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> treasures of the house of the Lord to geue them to The<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glathphelasser. And thoughe Ezechiah y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> good king folowing him destroied y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, did breake doun the hil alters, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> brasē serpent, thoughe I say y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kinge himself, fauored true religion, yet was their olde wickednes so roted in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> herts of his nobles &amp; cōmons, that besides cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spiracies &amp; pertakings within his own realm, &amp; also much war of forē nacions without wherwith God worthely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his subiectes for their stobernes. Al
<pb facs="7"/> theire walled Cytyes were taken by Senacheryb from the vttermoste bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnto Lakis, wherof our Prophet speaketh in the fyrste chapter: yea, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>salē was obsessed and beseged as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prophecieth that thys plage shoulde come to the gates of Ierusalem.</p>
   <p>Nowe we that reade and heare these olde thynges of Samaria and Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, their kings and Prynces. In the ende of the worlde, muste knowe that they are wrytten for our learnyng, that we beynge warned by theyre scourge, Plage, and fall: shulde feare to doo the lyke wyckednes. And heare in this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet cheiflye we are warned of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ambition, and extorsion. As for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry (thoughe our gouernours here in Englande through the mighty hand of God haue forthe comforte of hys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte banyshed the outwarde shewe ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of) Yet one sorte makynge thys mooste godlye and glorious fact to serue their luker &amp; gayne: to the sclaunder of such a notable enterpryse: haue seemed too chaunge the kinde of Idolatri, making y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> muck which they found heaped about those idols, to be their god. So that they maye worthely be called Idolaters, so lōg as thei haue it, kepe it, &amp; set so much
<pb facs="7"/> store by it, nether is it anye newe leare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to cal this their auarice Idolatry, for so Paul calleth it to Ephesians the v. Chapter. Another sort there is which in their heartes haue Idolles styll, and vtter it when occasion serueth, saying: that it was a good worlde when theese Idols of Wasyngeham, Canterburye, and theyr blessed Masse were worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and regarded. There be moo sortes whyche wyll be called Gospellers, that haue some their bellye for theyre God, some theyr subtile wittes and worldlye policies, some one thing, some another so that in effecte Idolatrye is not bany<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed, but raigneth more clokedly amōgs vs, too the ignominye and shame of the truthe of one God, whyche wee woulde seame to set forthe and maineteyne. As for ambicion &amp; extorcion the deuil prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth at this daye too stoppe the glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kingdome of Christe by thyem, and rayseth ambytyous stomackes, haulte, and proude mindes amongs those, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che would seeme the stoutest captaines of godlye cheualrye, whyche thorowe theyr vnsacyable ambicion and gready desire of gathering althings into their hāds, robbeth, &amp; reaueth, pilleth, polleth and oppresseth theyr felow sougiours.
<pb facs="8"/> So that vnder theyr holy professiō and pretensed religion, they do betray theyr graūd captaine and master of religion, and worketh more wyckedly of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyls part, for the contempt of God his word: then doth any one whych openly beareth hys badge and cognisaunce. A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaynst such therfore bryngeth our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete sore threatenynges, yea terryble thoundrynges. Wherunto it behoueth hye and low, the earthe and all earthlye creatures to geue eare, and to harken. For it is the woord of the Lorde, not of man whych Micha bringeth. The Lord hym selfe doth speake it from the holye temple of hys maiesty, from whence he shal come downe ryghte shortelye to be bothe a wytnes and Iudge agaynst vs.</p>
   <p>Wherefore lette vs iudge oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nowe warned by God hys woorde, that we be not iudged of the Lorde, and so for our wyckednes wyth the worlde cōdempned. For our God, whose worde is now sent amongs vs, is a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fyre, before whome no syn can be cloked. Hys worde is the hāmer breakynge the hard stone.</p>
