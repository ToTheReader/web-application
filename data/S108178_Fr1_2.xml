      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eere Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thinke it not strange I pray thee, that <hi>Esdras</hi> the Scribe and Prophet of the Lord (in the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipallest of his bookes) should be so little regarded:
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Dani.</hi> 12.6.7.8 9.10.</note> for <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, prophecying of these times, foretelling the wonders that shold come to passe in them, sayeth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Esdras</hi> 12 37.38</note>
      <hi>That none of the wicked should haue vnderstanding, but the wise shall vnderstand:</hi> And therefore was <hi>Esdras commaunded to wright those visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he saw in a Booke and hide them, &amp; teach them the wise of the people, whose hearts he knew were able to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the wayes of the highest:</hi> for as god himself doth not shew his secrets to the vnwise,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.14.</note> so no more would he haue the wise to whome he sheweth thē) to teach them but to the wise, least the vnwise, not being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, should spurne and barke against it: wherefore he sayeth, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 7 6.</note>
      <hi>giue not holy things to dogges,
neither cast ye your pearles before the Swine.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>And as wisedome is iustified of her Children,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 11.19.</note> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it is wisedome, and for no other respecte, so the vnwise resist it, because their tongues cannot taste it, nor their stomackes digest it,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 14.15.</note> it being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="3"/>and they earthly, who iudge things by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reason. Therefore hath God seene it good to lock vp, and hide his treasures and richest iewels, in most secret places, that the dilligent searchers for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might onely finde them out, and that fooles might be fooles as they please to be,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.3.4.5.</note> though wise in their owne conceits.</p>
   <p>The Booke of Wisedome which hath it name ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it nature; who knoweth not with what vehemency it is resisted, although it be the very flood of <hi>Salomons</hi> wisdome. If <hi>Iohn,</hi> The greatest that was borne of women,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 11</note> and Christ his Lord the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, were iudged (of the vnwise children) to be possest of diuels, what maruell though <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Esdras</hi> with other prophets and righteous men, be blasphemously delt withall?</p>
   <p>But the principall cause pretended is, for that it was not found compiled with other scriptures in the Hebrew tongue, for which cause they may aswell exclude some part of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the greatest part of the new Testament: but they say it is full of lyes, and was neuer cannonized: darst thou say so? Because the wisedome of the vnwise neuer cannonis'd it, did the children of wisedome therefore neuer approue it? If all be current that hath bene cannonized, Then many deuils shall goe to heauen, &amp; much falsehood shall stand for truth: and if all be lyes that is not can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized, then much truth shall perish, and many Saints goe to hell: For some of the Epistles of the Apostles, As the second Epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the two
<pb facs="3"/>last Epistles of <hi>Iohn, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iudes</hi> Epistles were for a long time not receiued generally, and many hundred Saints were neuer cannonized,
<note place="margin">By the Church of Rome.</note> wheras ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vncleane lyers and murth erers were: and darest thou blaspheme the truth and accuse it of lies for these causes? If Charity did rule thy heart, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome gouerne thy minde, thou wouldest labour to reconcile it with the other scriptures, which, if men be so disposed, they may also cauill against. But let men take heede what they doe, let them not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that they know not, nor call that a lye which they vnderstand not. If I should say Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> spake vnaduisedly, when he sayeth,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.25.</note>
      <hi>(There are also many things that Iesus did, which if they had bene all written, I suppose the world could not containe the bookes)</hi> did I not belye the holy Apostle? If time prooue that to be of God which I in my ignorant boldnes, blaspheme and speake against, shall I escape vnpunished by that truth? let me therefore take heede and feare, and as I may not take vpon me to affirm that I know not, so let me take heede that I condemne not that which I conceiue not; especially such holy writings wherein such great wisedome doth consist, least for a words sake that I vnderstand not, I depriue my selfe of a great benefit that I might enioy. For if time prooue it to be of God (as sure it will) what shall I then excuse my selfe withall? was not the Reuelation of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doubted of (by many) a great while, &amp; is it not now receiued as a most deuine Prophecy,? So shal it be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>nd in time, that none of al the Prophets
<pb facs="4"/>of ould, did excell this Prophet <hi>Esdras,</hi> nor see more secrets, nor prophecie more plainely of Iesus Christ, and of the misteries of the Gospell then he. And also greater wisedome is not to be found in all <hi>Salomons</hi> writings, then is in the book of Wisedome so much condemned, why should we not iustifie the truth for it owne sake, and not shake it off, and take it vp, vpon such colde and weake occasions?</p>
   <p>If the maiesty and truth of the other Scriptures did not plead for it selfe, Time also bringing foorth all the <hi>Hebrues, Grecians, Latinists,</hi> and <hi>Cannonisers</hi> in the world could neuer make it good therfore let truth speake, and wisdome vtter her voyce, and let time bring foorth as they haue euer done, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them not, and if thou be one of wisedomes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, receiue it.</p>
   <p>And although there be too many that dooth take vpon them to discouer prophecies, whose false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods time will discouer, yet there is a worke which is of God, and that shall stand mauger the spight of all it enemies: and let them that dare so boldly rage and rayle against it, knowe, that when the day doth declare it, they shall be ashamed, and wish they had held their tongues.</p>
   <p>Thus I thought good to aduertise thee by the way, least at the first sight of enuied <hi>Esdras,</hi> thou shouldst be dismayed: Enuied (I say) by enuious spirits, but approued of God and of his holy ones. I will say no more for him at this time, he is at hand, let him now speake for himselfe.</p>
