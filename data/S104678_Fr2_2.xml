<pb facs="39"/>
vnder our Beech tree: and make

necessitie. Trauellers hauing
passed many perils, inexplicable
dangers, vse to be delighted with
the recounting of their forepast
miseries, sea beat mariners hauing
sustained the tempestuous gustes
of the surging sea, and at last ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
at their hauen, which so
long time with importunacie
they desired, seeme not a little
delighted with the description of
their manifolde daungers. Wee
haue purchased by a mutuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of our owne power, a
mutual peace: and reposing vnder
the comfortable shade of minds
attonement, may make discourse
of our forepast griefes.</p>
   <p>

      <hi>Themystocles</hi> exiled his natiue
countrie, and kindly entertained

      </gap>s traine: <hi>periissē, nisi periissem.</hi>
O sirs, I had bene vndone, if I had
not beene vndone; so we, for in
our losse consists our welfare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
tried the rough chasticement
of discord, and exiled as it were,
the borders of peace and amitie,
and now enioying the content
of mindes vnion, may say, we
had neuer beene thus happy, if we
had not bene vnhappie, for the
fruition of happinesse hath the
best taste in his palate, who hath
once tasted the bitter relish of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse.</p>
   <p>We may now make a good
consort, since the iarring strings
<pb facs="40"/>
of discord be reduced to so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
harmony, that the verie
straines of our well concording
strings may delight our friendes
with a soule conceiuing melodie,
but distract the minds of such as
in the billowes of our vnnaturall
troubles, conceiued no small feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.
But these were like <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi>
that enuious Poet, who hearing
how the workes of others grew
acceptable and delightfull, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himselfe in despaire of their
good fortunes.</p>
   <p>But let them alone, they labour
of their owne phrensie: and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi>
bowels will burst with his
owne enuie; I haue composed
some few Sonets, and dedicated
them vnto your selfe, the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="40"/>
of Pernassus mount, thogh
of the meanest: yet some fruite
may bee gathered out of <hi>Ennius</hi>
dunghill, they be amorous, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a foolish passion, they are
more fit for <hi>Venus</hi> shrine, then <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranias</hi>
shape: for I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the praise of beautie,
least I should haue <hi>Stesychorus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
who for dispraising <hi>Hellen</hi>
of Greece, lost his sight. Let these
harsh poems now and then take
place amongst more serious stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>Damon</hi> euer carried about
with him some works of <hi>Pythias</hi>
as memorials of his affections,
<hi>Pylades</hi> the impression of his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Pyrithous</hi> the statue of his
<hi>Thesaeus:</hi> A poeme of loue will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the bitter tast of grauer stories.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="41"/>
      <hi>Pyndarus</hi> fountaines lie open as
well to <hi>Ouid,</hi> to write lasciuiously,
as to <hi>Sophocles</hi> to write tragically:
the minde affects variety, as the
stomach vseth to be glutted, if she
find no change, one instrument
of Musicke would make a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consort.</p>
   <p>It was no small praise for <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi>
to be esteemed skilfull in
exercises, and to haue generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
in what exploit soeuer he
tooke in hand. <hi>Terpnus,</hi> who was
<hi>Neroes</hi> musitian, was out of his
element when he had not a Lute
in his hand, and a wanton song
before him: <hi>Aeschines</hi> had little to
speake, when he was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but these resemble actors
vpon a stage, who can speake
<pb facs="41"/>
nothing, but in their owne parts:
interrupt them but a little, they
stand like <hi>Praxiteles</hi> pictures. I
receiue that Gentleman more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably,
who hath a superficiall
knowledge in all discourses, then
such an one as is exact in one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
knowledge alone.</p>
   <p>Thus recommending these few
scattered poems to your reading,
and wishing you as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
as earth can afford you in
this life, with the fruition of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
glory in the life to come, I
take my leaue euer resting,</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your affectioned Brother,
<hi>Richard Brathwaite.</hi>
