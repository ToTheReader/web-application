                 <title>Wits laberynth, or The exercise of idlenesse : Containing an artificiall texture of two thousand two hundred and sixtie figures, so placed and disposed, as by the helpe of a briefe direction for that purpose, you may tell which of them any man thinketh. As also by the same obseruation, to discouer any name, or number, that shall bee imagined. Besides an ample and large subiect for those that affect such ingenious recreations, by the sharpnesse of their owne conceits, to drawe out many other delightfull varieties. First composed in Italian by Andrea Ghisi, and now Englished and augmented</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all humane actions, the passage from one extreme to another was euer difficult and dangerous, and therefore for recouery of wearynesse procured by labour and exercise either of mind or body, which of necessity men must doe, was sport inuented, which is no other thing but the <hi>Exercise of Idlenesse.</hi> For that it being by his owne nature pleasurable, it might ease by little and little the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse and burthen of saciety and lassitude, and so gently drawe a man to rest and quiet. Now because labours be of diuers natures, and diuers (also) be the natures of the persons that vndergoe and endure them, to the end that euery one might find recreation proportionable to his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is graunted vnto sport and pastime, the liberty of variety. Variety, wherein nature so much gloryeth, and mans mind, and euery sence of his so much delighteth: which, not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all that the world can afforde thereof, doe runne with restlesse feete, or rather wearylesse winges, but can neuer runne ouer the huge field and the large confines of thinges therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. With this variety I being enamoured, by dressing and digging the small Garden-plotte of my weake wit, haue drawne thereout the fruit of this my Laberinth, which to your Highnesse I humbly dedicate.</p>
