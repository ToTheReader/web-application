      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongest a number of Cathechismes, which flie abroad, I haue not reade any, either for shortnesse more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, or in matter more substantiall, or in maner of stile more easie, or for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the simple more facile, then this Metricall Cathechisine of yours, whiche la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely came to my handes: whiche though it were sent by you to your familiar freendes, as a testimonie to them of your good will, (beeyng at the firste farre from any purpose to haue it come to light, or to bee published to others) yet presumyng vpō your freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptation of my good meaning, I haue aduentured to put in printe, that a worke so needefull for all, should not bee made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate to some fewe, but communicated to many. And I doubte not but that the good acceptyng of these firstlynges of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb facs="4"/>and the greate profite whiche this small booke shall bryng to the Churche of GOD, will enbolden and animate you to proceede to the publishyng of greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For howsoeuer in humilitie you seeke to shrowde your self <hi>intra domesticos pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etes,</hi> carefully and painfully keepyng your self within the cōpasse of your owne charge, yet you cannot so hide your rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lēt giftes (I write without flaterie) but that profitably thei breake for the to the aduaūce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of Gods kyngdome, and greate bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his childrē. And I would wishe (suche is my desire to haue others profited, as I my self haue been comforted and confirmed by you) that as you haue been by preachyng the worde, a fruitfull labourer in Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde, so you would vouchsafe also by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng at your conuenient oportunitie, to do good to many, who though thei haue not seen you, yet desire to bee partakers of the fruites of your labours. You are better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen then you surmise, and more is expected at your handes, then you imagine. Employe your Talentes euery waie to the vttermost and applie your self to benefite not a priuate
<pb facs="5"/>Congregation onely, but the whole bodie of the Churche also, so farre forthe as it shall seme good to your godlie wifedome. I take not vppon me to directe you, but I tell you what I wishe, that the same benefite whiche I myself and other yoùr hearers, haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by your preaching, might also by other your trauailes, redounde to the comforte of them, who neuer heard you.</p>
