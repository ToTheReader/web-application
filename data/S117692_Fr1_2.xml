   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honourable, Sir Henrie Neuell Knight, Lord a Burgauene, and his singuler good Lord, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orsmuch, my singuler good Lord, as I haue perceiued you to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie inclined to the art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and chiefelie to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in that part, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie called Chirurgerie, I haue not beene a little carefull since my acquaintance with your Lordship, to further you in the same studie, euen to the vttermost of my power, and forasmuch as you haue so profited, not onelie in the Theorike part, but also in the practike, I haue thought all my paines &amp; labors well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. And although I should holde my peace, and saie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heerein, yet a great number of poore men, and others, which haue bene cured of your Lordship, of many sundrie griefes and diseases, will set abroade and bewraie your notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and charitable deedes. And forasmuch as your Honour hath better vnderstanding in this worthie arte, than a greate manie of those which take vpon them the name of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, I might verie well saie, the most parte. And forasmuch as your Lordship beareth such a singuler loue vnto the same arte, I am therefore moued to dedicate these my simple tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes vnto your Honour, to bee the patrone and defender thereof, for I doe perceiue, that now in our time no good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise can be gone about, but false detraction and enuie is like to ouerthrowe the same, which hath mooued mee for as
<pb facs="3"/> much as you are a noble man, the rather to dedicate my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes vnto your Honour, to bee my aide and succour in the defending of this my small trauaile, which I protest I haue not taken in hand, neither for vaine glorie, neither yet for anie worldlie profit or gaine, for since the first time that I beganne to sette out anie parte of this arte in our English tongue, I haue both susteined great displeasure, and also lost manie profites, of those which were in times past my spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friendes, and the greatest matter that they haue to saie against mee, is onelie that I goe about to make euerie bodie cunning in the arte of medicine, with setting foorth of these my workes in the English tongue, but if it shall please your good Lordshippe to vnderstand my bounden dutie, first to almightie God, of whom I haue receiued the talent, and also my dutie to my naturall Countrie, whom I ought to profite with my talent, according to the saying of our sauiour Iesus Christ, which saith, He that hideth his talent in the ground, and vseth it not to the profit of his neighbour, it shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him againe. Wherefore my good Lord, I thinke it my dutie to set foorth these thinges for the commoditie of the common wealth of my Countrie. What greater profite may come vnto any in the time of neede, than to cure his grieuous woundes, without which hee should presentlie die: to cure his grieuous sores, which dooth not onelie eate the flesh, but fretteth and rotteth in sunder the great bones, with most vehement griefe and paine, and also great inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tumours against Nature, which taketh awaie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions of the bodie, and molesteth it with most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continuall paine, and also curing of broken bones, and bones beeing out of ioynt, to restore them into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall places againe, with many other griefes appertaining to the same arte which were heere to long to bee recited.</p>
   <p>And for as much as manie haue taken vppon them the curation of these diseases aboue sayde, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many great errors for lacke of knowledge, to no small daunger of Gods people, &amp; no lesse hurt of the cōmō wealth, I haue thought it therefore my bounden dutie, to set foorth my onelie one talent in furthering of knowledge, euen as the
<pb facs="3"/> poore widow did, which had but onelie one farthing, and put the same into the Lords treasure, &amp; like as that same was accepted with almightie God, so I trust he wil accept this my good will, according to the knowledge which he hath giuen me, so that at the last daie, I trust he shall not saie vnto mee, thou hast hidde thy talent in the ground, and not profited therewith as thou shouldest haue done.</p>
   <p>And also I trust that good men of my Countrie shal haue no cause to haue an euill opinion in mee, either through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or idlenesse, for that they may well perceiue that these trauailes do both require studie and time of setting foorth. Now my singuler good Lord, if they shall saie it is not good because it is in the English tongue, then I must alleadge vnto them the famous men which were the chiefe setters forth of the same art, as Hippocrates and Galen amongst the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whatsoeuer they might vnderstand by foreine languages, either else gather by reason, or by experience, or obseruation of time, all these, whatsoeuer they were, they did write them in Greeke, which was their owne language &amp; tongue, to that end, they might the better bee vnderstanded, and sooner bee learned. Also in like manner the worthie Arabians, as that noble king Auicen, Auerois, Albucasis, Mesue, &amp; a great sort more of worthie men, which did collect and translate manie noble workes of Medicine out of the Greeke tongue, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue tongue, and many other languages, into their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall tongue, which was then the Arabian tongue. In lyke manner the Latinists were no lesse diligent to collect and gather, both out of the Greeke and Arabian tongue, &amp; wrote it in their owne tongue, as you may reade in the workes of those famous men, Plinius and Cornelius Celsus, with manie other more, whose workes are manifest at this present daie: If these worthie men haue beene moued with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for knowledge sake, and for the better maintenance of their common wealth, in setting foorth of this art for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, comfort, succour, helpe, and health, of those that be sicke and diseased, or other waies wounded or hurt, in warre, or by mischaunce, &amp;c. Why should not I then without blame or reproch, for the furtherance of knowledge and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="4"/> things aboue rehearsed, set foorth in our English tongue, some part of this good and necessarie arte, for the instruction and further knowledge of those young students, which are desirous to learne the same, and to vse the same to the profite of the common wealth in the time of necessitie, I doe not meane, that honest Artists, as Tailers, Shoomakers, Weauers, or anie other handie occupations, that they should leaue their artes wherein they are perfect, and fal to this art of Medicine, for I doe wish with all my heart, that politike lawes might be made, to constraine euerie man to follow that art, in which he hath bene well instructed and brought vp in. But my meaning is, onelie to instruct those that be brought vp in the art of Surgerie vnder some experimenters, who hath little learning in the tongues, &amp; yet desirous to attaine knowledge, and forasmuch as these experimenters are permitted by lawes to occupie the art of Surgerie, I thought it my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dutie, both for the furtheraunce of their knowledge, and also for the reliefe of these that be diseased, to set foorth this in the English tongue which I haue done, I doo not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to instruct those which be great learned men, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth the tongues, neither yet doe I goe about to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the minde of those that be contentious and captious, that will rather finde fault with other mens dooings, than to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those that be willing to learne with their good dooings. My intent is onelie to further those that be willing to learne, which with humble and gentle heart doo accept and take in good part other mens great paine and trauailes, and foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Prentises and young men, which haue not beene trained vp in schooles, neither yet can vnderstand the Greeke or Latine tongue, and yet can vnderstand and reade English verie well, and be of readie wit and good memorie, to carrie awaie that they reade &amp; heare: It hath mooued me therfore the rather to write these bookes in the English tongue, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the foundation of art doth consist onelie in reason &amp; experience, neither can ther be anie third thing added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, as Galē affirmeth in his 3. booke, named Therapeuticon, It semeth to me therefore, that he which vnderstandeth any tongue, whether it be Greke, Latin, or English, it serueth him
<pb facs="4"/> no more but for the further vnderstāding of that thing which he doth reade: for it doth not follow, that euery one which can speake Greke, Latin, or Ebru, by and by to be a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, or perfectlie to vnderstand the Arte of Medicine, for the common people amongst the Gretians, spake the Greke tongue, and so in other countries, which speaketh their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and yet neither Diuines, neither yet Phisitions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth manifestly apeare by Galen, that the tongues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not an Artist, but reasonable knowledge being ioyned with experience, maketh the Artist, so that in what tongue soeuer a man may gather knowledge, whether it be Greke, Ebru, Latin, English, or what other language soeuer it be, that same knowledge being ioyned with reason and experience, maketh a perfect Artist: yet my good Lord, I would wish that he that should be a Chirurgion, should vnderstand the tongues, for as much as in times past they haue bene more diligent, &amp; careful to further their common welthes in those countries, then they be in ours, by meanes whereof they haue brought many noble Artes into their owne tongues, which we haue not so largely set forth in our English tongue.</p>
   <p>Therefore if the professors of Chirurgerie were learned in these tongues, they might more easely vnderstand the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Arte, with their true diuisions, and definitions which should the more readier instruct them to follow a true methode, and this hath bene one cause which hath moued me to take this matter in hande. Thus most humbly beseeching your Lordship to take these bookes, the fruites of my paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trauailes, into your noble protection, &amp; defend both them and me your poore suppliant, from the mallice of busie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters, and I shall not onely be the better incouraged to set forth other things according to my knowledge for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraunce of the common wealth, but also as my duetie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to pray vnto the almightie Lord, for your Lordships long life, perfect health, and dayly increase of honour.</p>
