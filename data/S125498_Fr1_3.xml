I know it shall be a pleasure to you, to reade what wee haue selt; and as great a happinesse to me (who haue published this:) if the Story of a poore Souldiers trauels, can bring you any contentment, let me finde at your handes (I intreate you) the selfe same loue which Sicke-men receiue from their friendes, when they begin to recouer; And that is a kinde visitation and reioycing, to see a crazed and weake body reduced to his former strength: Mine (I thanke God) is now so, and shall grow
<pb facs="4"/>more and more into health, by how much the more you pittie my misfortunes: you cannot pittie them, vnlesse you know them, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know them vnlesse you reade this ouer which I sende you; and I would not willingly haue you read, vnlesse you buy, because you should pay for the Warres somewhat as well as I: not doubting therefore of the one, because I hope you desire the other: I wish your owne wishes to you: and so farewell.</p>
