   <head>THE PREFACE TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, as this small Treatise is generally intended for the good of Gods Church: so in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular there is no man of what degree or estate soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whom it may not in some sort or other neerely concerne, to entertaine it into his most serious consideration. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amongst men more common, then to to buy and sell. And lightly sinne is the Stickler or Broker betweene both. <hi>It is naught, saith the buyer</hi>; It îs pure good, saith the seller: when both the simulation of the one, and the dissimulation of the other, is the worst part of the commoditie. Yet I speake of such commodities, as are a lawfull Mart, and Market-able, as we say; I speake not of stollen goods, whereof the very actuall buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and selling is vniust; and proues euen
<pb facs="6"/>
dangerous to the Parties, often Fellonious. If therefore euery man should bee carefull not onely (in regard of Gods law) how, but (also of mans Law) what he buy or sell in the open Markets or elsewhere, though it bee a thing of common prise: How much more then in such things, as are not of a common nature, and the very act of buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof is questionable for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, or rather out of question vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Of such things onely I would heere warne all buyers and sellers; no lesse then if a man proscribing his house to sale, should cause to be proclaimed,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Cic. Offic. lib.</hi> 3.</note>
      <hi>Domum pestilentem vendo,</hi> I would sell a house infected with the Plague. Yet such a house may come to bee purged again. But if a man should proclaime▪ I sell a House or Land, hauing a crackt Title, the sale whereof I cannot warrant to bee good (which too many can make sale of, without proclaiming any such thing) where would he finde a Chapman to giue him his prise, vnlesse such, whose braines were as crackt, as his Title is. Or if a man wittingly sell, and another ignorantly buy a crackt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is but so much dammage to the one, but how great damnation to the other! But
<pb facs="7"/>
loe I warne you here of a House, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and title whereof is worth the inquiring after, before wee goe about to buy it. This house is Gods house. Which, if it be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Pestilence, consider; if the Title of it, and of the Demaines be crackt, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sale, consult. It is a speciall case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; for resolution wherof, I intreate thy paines and patience in the perusing of this small Treatise. Reade it, as I haue writ it, for conscience, and not for curiositie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I take not vpon me to determine, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue impanelled a graund Iurie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and learned Doctors, whose ioynt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is here deliuered. Nor haue I hookt in all the out branches, that the Learned haue obserued to grow from the same Tree of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; I haue gathered onely the maine, leauing the remaines for Gleanings.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ob.</hi> But many one will say, what is this to me? This is a subiect out of the common Road-way of my Reading. I am no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, saith one: I am no Patron, saith another; &amp;c. and therefore what is Simonie to me?</p>
   <p>I answere (as I said before) I know no man of what condition soeuer, whether hee be high or low, rich, yea or yet poore, whom
<pb facs="7"/>
this Treatise doth not either directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or else indirectly and by way of necessarie consequence concerne. As for all Patrons, it concernes them directly: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes all Ministers directly, whither actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Ministers, or such as deuote their minds that way. It concernes all other persons, such as are neither Patrons, nor yet capable of the Ministerie, if any haue but children and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to bestow on them; that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with this little Booke, whither it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, or no (as the too common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of the world is) to lay out his money for a Benefice for his Sonne. Yea, it may concerne all such Courtiers, or Noblemens Stewards, or great Officers Clerkes or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, who though they be no Patrons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet perhaps haue some facultie to deale as Patrons. If any Reade, and reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profit hereby, either by preuenting what may bee misdone, or by repenting of what is done, I haue my desire and reward. And for this <hi>Censure of Simonie,</hi> if it must needes procure the Simonists censure, let him turne the edge the right way, vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, not vpon me; except he had rather in malice cut me, then in mercie cure himselfe.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
