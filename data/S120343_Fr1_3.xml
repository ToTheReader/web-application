erronious, no profit shall ryse to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

on certaine and sure precepts, but rather
when suche errors doe happen, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
them on the parson, and not on the
Art. For if through the mysuage of some
men, good thinges should be condemned:
what Art so good should not be misliked
of? what doctrine so wholsome for the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ople,
so profitable for the common wealth
and so necessarye for mans vse, should not
be cleane banished Then should Phisicke

esteemed, thought the vnskilfulnes and
rashenes of the practisers, put oftētymes
the patients and clyents in great hasard,
peril and mischiefe, no more oughte thys
Act of diuination to be eschewed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
daungers may be foreseene, and yet it
selfe voyde of all daunger &amp; perill. What
haz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rde of life: what losse of substaunce?
or what daūger of lim cā a dreame put y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
dreamer vnto? enē so much as whē he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh,
he wondereth how such imagina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
or fancy crept into his minde. Be his
dreame neuer so terrible or fearefull, as
falling into the hāds of theues, werewoū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
by thē, fightinge in bloudy battailes,
or on euerye syde beset wyth enemyes, in
suche maner as it would make a stout mā
to quake, yet when he awaketh no skinne
is brokē, he hath no ache in his bones, he
is stil in his quiet bedde, as whole and as
safe, as when he went to rest nothinge so
nor so, it was onlye a dreame. If now he
haue his knowledge of diuination, what
a cōfort wil it be to hym? that examining
the cyrcumstances in their due tyme &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
shal prognosticate what such things
portende. And thereby may solace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb facs="7"/>
with good happes, and labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
or hinder the imminent mysfortune,
or at the least arme hymselfe so stronglye
wyth patience as quietly to beare theim:
for a mischiefe knowne of before, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gētly
loked for, is not so greuous as whē
it commeth on a sodayne. It is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
thing and almost incredible that drea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes
should haue such vertu in them, were
it not that God hath reuealed it vnto vs:
When he himselfe, as a meane, often vsed
them, to open vnto his people of Israell,
his secrete wil and pleasure. Were it not
that we haue red of the wonderful chaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in olde time foretolde by them: and
were it not agayn that we dayly se the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of dreames. But alas, our ignorance
maketh vs so blynde, that we know them
not, vntil they be paste. For a man behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
in his sleape the toppe or ende of an
house fallinge downe, hearyng a dogge to
barke or houle, seeynge a hare to chase a
hound, or a byrd to flye withoute winges
will seeke no further, but esteeme it as a
vayne dreame, laughinge at his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate,
hauing more regard to the present
spectacle, then to the cyrcumstaunces to


<pb facs="7"/>
come making no more accompte of them,
then of thinges casual, natural, or impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
For a house to fall doune is casuall,
a dogge to barcke naturall, the hare to
persecute the hound, is agaynst nature, &amp;
a foule to flye withoute winges soundeth
impossible. Yet al these by cyrcumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
signifie such euētes, as may be for the
profitte or hinderance of the dreamer. It
seemeth a thing against nature, &amp; a thing
moste straunge for a woman to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a firebrande: yf <hi>Hecuba</hi> had lefte
here, and sought no further, then had she
not knowen howe her sonne <hi>Paris</hi> wyth
whō she then went, should be the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne countrye <hi>Troye.</hi> It is
monstrous for a Uyne to springe out of a
womans bowels, and for the Braunches
to couer or shadow the greate country of
<hi>Asia,</hi> yet this foreshewes <hi>Astiages,</hi> that
of his daughter should bee borne suche a
child, as should grow to a mighty Prince
and vnnaturallye should driue him out of
his kingdome.</p>
   <p>For a <hi>Cignet</hi> to hane feethers sone gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
