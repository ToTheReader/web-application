You are as honourable in the hearts, affections and tongues of all that know you in these parts, as if all the titles and complements of Honour which in a state are conferred upon eminent Persons, had beene already heaped upon you. And although (as the Prince of Philosophers long since pronounced) <hi>honorest in honorante magis quàm in honorato,</hi> honour be rather in him that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth then in him that is honoured, yet this Honour in you will be as indeleble a Character, as that which accrueth by bloud, is accounted by the Men of Law. For as amongst the old Romanes there was no way to the Temple of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but through the Temple of Vertue, so you have gone the high way to this Honour, by those vertues that are of a Magneticall vertue to draw to them the hearts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of men;<note place="margin">Si vis benè au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire, discito benè loqui, &amp; cum benè lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui didiceris, rectè etiam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conator, Hoc enim modo bonam famam acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

For, if any man thinke to erect the great fabricke of dignity, let him first thinke upon the foundation of humility. Dignity delighteth all men but
<pb facs="5"/>humility is the step to it.<note place="margin">Omnes dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat celsitudo, sed humilitas gra-dus est. Quid tendis ordem ultra te?

      </note> Why dost thou lift thy foote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy selfe? that's the way to fall downe, not to clime up, begin at the step, and thou hast already climed up.

   <p>Howbeit it is not the Contemplation of these faire graces in you (<hi>quid enim sunt bona nostra, nisi dona dei?</hi> what are our good deeds, but Gods good graces in us?) that onely animateth me to present and Dedicate this piece of my labours to you.
