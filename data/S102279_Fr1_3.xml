<pb facs="3"/> collected out of many and sundrie sortes of authours: as if a man should in the spring time gather togeather beautiful blossomes from all kindes of trees. To declare the fruite of these floures it shal not be needefull in this place: seeing that the page folowing doth shewe the particular contentes of euery Chapter: but this onely I will say: that besides a great number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, woorthie bothe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and also the remembring: thou shalt finde briefely, and truely repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the notable actes, ends and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable chaunces of almoste all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes that haue reigned tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the worlde vntil this day.</p>

Thus eftsoones cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thy patiēce in bearing with mine,
<pb facs="4"/> and also the Printers imperfections: I remit thee vnto the reading of the worke: the whiche I do hartily praye may worke in thee the wished effect, so that it may redound bothe vnto thine vnspeakable pleasure and profite: and also the surpassing praise of the peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse creator: and then shal J be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to proceede: and fully to matche in matter the ample and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious title.</p>
