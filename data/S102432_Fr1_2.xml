   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen these few leaues were writ at the first (Christian Reader) it was not my meaning thus by print to haue made them common, for they were writte vpō the request of a perticular man, for the comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of his troubled soule, but since one writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten coppy hath begot so many, and made me haue so many suters for moe, the number of afflicted cōsciences being in these dayes so many as I know they be, and they that haue had the reading heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of already, reporting and confessing vnto me that thereby they haue bin much comforted, though I know that it was not nor is not penned so exactly, nor yet the matter dealt in so substātially as things in these dayes to be published had neede to be, yet I haue suffered my selfe by the importunitie of the godly that haue requested euen this at my hands to be ouerread, and so to publish it I hope for the benefite of all those that shall reade it: for this I am sure of. I haue so layd downe comforts for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the broken hearted Christian, that withall I haue I hope taken all occasion from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and godlesse, of taking cause to be sure by any thing heere set downe, which I take to bee very necessary to be regarded in such preatises and
<pb facs="3"/>discourses: wherefore be the Reader hereof a right and true Christian, or a carnall and counterfeyte Gospeller, he may in this short and briefe tracte find that which may be profitable for him: if he be of the later sort, then here shal he learne that where true iustification in deede is, there is also sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that therefore he deceyues himselfe in presuming of the former, hauing neuer had any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntance with the later: and if he be of the first sort, be he weake, or strong in faith, heere shall he find both matter to leade him on in his strēgth, and to rayse him vp in his weakenesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take it vnto thee Christian Reader, and learne to make thy profite of it according to thy hearte, and a salue of it according to thy sore. That thou mayest thus do, I beseech the Lord to direct thee in reading of it with his spirit, and hauing done I pray thee recompence my good will in commending me vnto God in thy heartie Prayers agayne. Farewell.</p>
