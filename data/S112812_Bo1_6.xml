   <p>DEarly belouyd, you that haue wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, vnderstanding, and wyll to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structyd in this controuersie now raysyd in the Churche about apparell, at thys tyme thys shall suffyce. Yt is true that the teachers of handye craftes affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that no man can attayne to suche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente perfeccyon in worke, as maye be disputed of by reasone, muche lesse when the rule of religion muste be framyd accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge to the rule of Godes wyll, which is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rule of all perfeccyon, may we loke that any thyng can so perfectly be performyd of vnperfect mā, that in all poynts yt may answere to the perfeccion that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith: neuertheles God requirith his seruice to be suche as hym sealfe is, deuyne, pure, syncere, vnmingled, and in no parte corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptyd, and as lacke of strenthe shal not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs, in that we can not, so neclygence makythe vs more wickyd, yf that we may performe, and we will not. Fyrste we are requityd to loue God with all our hartes, all our myndes, and all our strength, that precisenes is comendable, which withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith not a lytill, whē all is requiryd. Thou shalt be perfect with thy Lorde thy god.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> Thou shalt not bende ether to thy ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande, or to the leafte. Thou shalt nether
<pb facs="19"/> adde, nether diminishe of that which is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundyd. Thou shalt not inquier for the gods of the Gentyls, sayinge: Howe dyd those Gentyles serue theyr godes. Thou shalt not do so to the Lorde thy god. For whatsoeuer the Lorde abhorreth, that dyd they to theyr godes. God wyll haue his children so to abhorre these supersticion, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shuld fle euen from that infecciō that comythe by hearynge.<note place="margin">The zeall that God requirith.</note> Furthermore, so many thinges as ar cōmandyd of leprous, mēstreous, dead bodys, were many, which myght not be touchyd without defyling, what other thinges were they in that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de people,<note place="margin">God kepe vs frō all outwarde shew of Popery.</note> but exercises of precyse purenes and cleanes, the obseruance of suche sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, althoughe it hath byn longe synce abolyshyd, yet the euerlastinge truthe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynyth: muche more in presence of the bodye, that no prophane or defylyd thinge may be minglyd with gods seruice. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer god forbydyth all strange corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mixtures, whē he forbyddyth them to sowe land with diuers seedes, to plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe with an oxe and an asse, to weare ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyne and wollen to gether. For lyberte &amp; costome euen in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> leaste matters bredythe boldnes, &amp; in hys cōmandement god hath also respecte to the kynde of apparell. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie
<pb facs="19"/> when this cleanes is streachyd euen to brute beastes,<note place="margin">marke well.</note> who wold not beleue that God requirith an vtter detestacion of all vncleanes, especially in religion. Seing all these lawes perteyne to the fyrst cōmande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accordinge to the same precise rule dyd the holy fathers exercise them selues vnto puryte, therfore it is neuer rede that the godly Patriarches dyd sacrifyce vpon the Idolators alters, but whythersoeuer they remouid,<note place="margin">Example of holy men.</note> always they buyldid newe alters. Furthermore Abraham wolde not take a thryde of the Kynge of Sodoma. Iacob buryed the earinges that weare or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes of supersticion, with the Idoles them selues. Moyses to blemishe the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God wolde accepte no condicions at all, there shall not remayne on house, saythe he very precislye. Dauith wold not take the names of the Idoles in his lypes. Ezechias brake the brasen serpēt, not only chāgyd the vse of it.<note place="margin">What gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heryty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes cā ther be, then the Papistes?</note> The Holy ghost pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sithe those godly Kinges, which destroyed the highe places, as Ezechias and Iosias, in whiche places somtyme the people dyd worship god. Elyazer wold not fayne that he dyd eate swynes fleshe. S. Pawle byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dythe, Refrayne from all shew of euyll. S. Iohn forbyddyth vs to salute an hery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke.
<pb facs="20"/> And Polycarpus his disciple, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneus wytnessith, when he mett an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke, wolde not gyue hym other answere, but that he knewe hym to be the Deuells eldeste sonne. for suche feare had the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postels &amp; theyr disciples, that they wolde not comunicate withe on worde with any that had corruptyd the faith. Fynallie S. Pawle in playne wordes cōmandyth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisnes,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> sayinge, Take hede that ye walke precislye or exactlye, for so the greke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de signifieth. Last of all, let vs not forget what our Sauiour Christ saythe: He that is faythfull in the leaste, wyl be faythfull in the moste. Who also teachith vs, howe faythfully and precislye we shulde walke, what colde be more precisly spoken of, the law shall passe vntyll all be fullfyllyd, and he that breakyth one of the leaste cōman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dements, and teachith other so to do, ether by worde, or by example, shalbe least in the Kyngdome of heauen. Yt is euident by these reasons and examples, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenes or scrupulosite in godes religion, can be to muche or blame worthie. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> substance, ther is no controuersy, but yt is lawfull as the good creature of god, and to this purpose pertayne those sayinges: The kyngdome of heauen is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="20"/> meate nor drynke. Meate cōmendith vs not to god. Whatsoeuer enterithe in to the mouth, defylyth not the man. All thinges ar cleane to them that ar cleane. &amp; other lyke places of scripture, all which they pertayne to the matter or creature &amp; substance only, not to euery vse, fassion, or maner of vsynge. It is to muche doltyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not to vnderstand all thynge a ryght, excepte we wyll also conclude of the same places, that by glotony, dronkenes, whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, disquisyd aparell, and suche lyke, the lawe of god is not brokē. garments ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ar vrgyd in respecte of the forme and vse, they are not indifferent, and fyrst of the ende, which they labor so muche to proue that it is chaungyd, that those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges which before were vsyd to supersticiō, now are cōmandyd for order &amp; comlynes. No godly man doubtyth, but the Quenes Maieste intendinge an other end in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of those thinges, then the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes vsyd them for. But who so well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derith y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nature of those thinges, shall play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely se, that the end which thé commander propoundyth, dothe not folowe, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the diuersite of them y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> vse them, and them that iudge of them, a cleane cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary end ensuythe, for many popishe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
<pb facs="21"/> vse them to the same supersticious end that they dyd in Popery, and greatest of all is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> multitude of ignorant people, that iudgith none otherwyse of them.<note place="margin">Cor. 8.</note> All men haue not knowledge, for some with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Idole, euen yet do eate meate offred to Idoles. So Gedeon made an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phode,<note place="margin">Iud. 8.</note> not that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people shulde go a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge after it, yet was it the destruction of hym and his howse foreuer. Secondly it can not serue for order and comlynes,<note place="margin">Cor. 14.</note> which hath in it no necessary cause of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Let all thinges be donne for edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nether can it be conuertyd to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of the Christian Churche, which is the chaste spowse of Christ, which is takē from Antichrist, and the fylthye whore of Babylon. What cōsent hath Christ with Belyall? what porcion hath the faythfull with the infydell? or what agrement hath the temple of God with Images? Yf the reason of S. Paule be examynyd,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> by the which he dissuadith the Corynthians frō eating of meate offeryd to Idoles, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me may be also extendyd to garmēts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratyd to Idolatry. The nature of cery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and rytes is to make the vser to haue felowship with the principall of that religion, as the Iewes of the alter, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb facs="21"/> with Christ, and Gentils with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells. As manye as are partakers of the breade which we breake, are partakers of the bodye of Christe. They therfore that eate meate offeryd to Idoles, are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of deuells. And as many as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized haue put on Christ: it is not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryd, leaste as many as weare antychristes robes, wil take more yf auctorite comand it, neyther dothe the auctoryte of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian Magistrat excuse vs, except we thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, that Sergius Paulus myght permyte that S. Paule had forbydden the sentence of Iamys, which is,<note place="margin">Act. 15. Deut. 12.</note> that the gentyls shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de abstayne from the polucion of Idoles, God will borowe nothynge of Idoles to garnysh or become his religion. thou shalt not do so to the Lorde thy god, but rather he commandyth vtterly to destroye theyr alters, woddes, pyllers, and theyr very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. He forbyddyth them also to brynge any thinge in to theyr howses that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gythe to Idoles. Esaye chap. 30. byddyth those that are earnestly turnyd to the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe of god, to cast awaye the reliques of Idolatrie, You shall, sayth he, put out the couerynge of the Imagis of syluer,<note place="margin">that is all thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Idolatry.</note> &amp; the precious vestymēts of the goldē Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, and thou shalt caste them awaye lyke
<pb facs="22"/> a menstrous clowte, and saye vnto yt: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nawnte, or get the hence. Fynallye when all godly men abhorre the monstrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell of Fryers, Monkes, Chanons, I can not se, by what order they shulde exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the ornaments of Popishe Preastes, whose order is as wyckyd as Freyers, Monkes, or any other, which thyng may be sayd of the reste of the Popishe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, which may all with lyke precepte and coloure, &amp; by as good reason be receuid in the Churches as those. But admyttinge that these thynges were neuer so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yet it can not be that we shulde thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke them lawfull, for vs to vse them: for euē those thinges, which by them sealues are lawfull, whē an other circumstance is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd to them, then become they vnlawfull for a Christian to vse them, as in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. First we can not cast of all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hauing so many reasons on our syde, and so manye examples bothe of learnyd men, and best reformyd Churches, but in all thinges most indifferent. Saint Paule chargith euery mā to be certanly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyd in his owne mynde, which some men vntruly translate, Let euery man abownde in his owne sence, for he that with doubt of conscience eatyth, which of it sealfe is
<pb facs="22"/> lawfull, is condemnyd, because he doth it not of fayth. Now the assurance of fayth muste be sought no where, but in Gods worde. Secondlye, thowghe we shulde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfye our consciences, yet this man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylid, which is not persuadid by Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, but encreased by our examples, that he dare do that, whereof before he doubted, and this is to geue an offence, as they cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it to anger them, for they that are best pleasyd with these matters, are most offendyd, that they stomble and falle, we must not do what so euer is lawfull, but what so euer also is profytable to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: nether must we only regarde what lyberte permyttyth, but rather what our brothers proffyt requiryth. Thyrdlye, we maye not altogether neclecte what infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells iudge of vs in the vsynge of thinges lawfull by them sealfes, and therefore S. Paule byddeth them that are callyd to the feastes of the gentyls, so sone as mencyon is made of meate offeryd to Idoles, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne from eatinge of it, because of hym that tolde of it, and his conscience, not of hym sealfe, but of an other. What the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pistes iudge of vs, maye easely be seene by this, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Harding for the retayning of those Popishe cerymonies, cōteynith hope that
<pb facs="23"/> popery shalbe restoryd: what the ignorant people iudge of the reamnants of papistri retaynyd, wyse men may well consyder. Herunto might haue byne ioynid the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of olde Doctors, Iustinus, Ireneus, Tertullianus, Agustyne, Ambros, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostums, Celestinus, &amp; almost all the rest, for abhorrynge the customes and ryghtes of the Iewes and gentyles and heritykes, but Gods truthe nedyth not mans aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte, except they that be against vs, in this cause wyll appeale to the fathers, thē shall they perceyue, that in nomber both of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and sentences, we shall be nothinge inferior to them. In the meane tyme this maye suffyce, to shew fyrst that the precy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians is blameles, secondly the garmētes ar not indifferent, &amp; thyrdly that thowghe they were indifferent, yet ther is sufficient reason at this tyme, why we shoulde not weare them. Come Lord Iesus, and make an ende of thys wyckyd wordle, that thy sainctes may come to gether, that we may synge with the in thy holy hyll for euer. He that ouercomith, shalbe crownyd. Pray, pray, as the Apostell Peter sayth: the end of all thinges is at hand.</p>
