   <head>❧ To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thought I when I Preached this Sermon to take a second paines about it to write it to the Presse, but the earnest request of diuers persons hath preuailed with me, to remember them that heard me of that they heard, and to impart the same to many others that heard me not. If there may be to thee that good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which they haue hoped for, that haue so earnestly desired it, I shall bee glad that God disposed me to the seruice of that day. Of the matter here intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="5"/> I know much might haue bene said, but I was to keepe my selfe within the compasse of a Sermon, and very little haue I now set downe either more or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then I then spake. Let mee now, good Reader, vse this opportunity to request pardon of thee, if by such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions which haue sundrie wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, since the Printing of my last Booke, I be somewhat the longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I giue thee the answere to Doctor <hi>Bishops</hi> late reproofe. I haue in the end of that last Booke, giuen thee an aduertisement, which the Printer on the toppe of euery Page, giuing to that Addition the Title of the whole worke going before, hath mis named, <hi>The third part of the defence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catholicke,</hi> by which thou maiest take knowledge of the qualitie
<pb facs="5"/> and condition of that reproofe. I pray thee let that satisfie thee for the time, till leisure may serue to goe forward with that, which I haue already in good part begunne. Albeit by the reading of that Aduertisement, thou maiest happily conceiue, that it is but labour ill bestowed, to deale with a man so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely impudent, as thou maiest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>Doct. Bishop</hi> hath in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe framed himselfe to bee. But whatsoeuer his booke be in it selfe, thou shalt see it will giue mee occasion of a worke, which I hope shall giue satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and be helpfull vnto many, God therein assisting me, by thy prayer for me, and giuing me health and strength for the performance of it. Further I cannot omit, to wish thee in my second part against the said <hi>Doct. Bishop,</hi> to take notice of one speciall fault since
<pb facs="6"/> espied by me, and not noted in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which are there set downe in the end. <hi>Pag. 978.</hi> in the last line thou readest, <hi>He receiued of them no warrant of authority, but only by consent,</hi> where it should be, <hi>but only testimony of consent.</hi> Some other faults there were ouerslipped in my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie reading, as <hi>pag. 362. line 2. This spirit and prayer a true witnesse,</hi> for <hi>this spirit of payer is a true witnesse,</hi> and <hi>pag. 967. lin. 9. it is vnknowne,</hi> for, <hi>it is not vnknowne,</hi> which and such like thou canst by thine owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding easily discerne. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, vnderstand I pray thee, that some man lighting vpon my copie of that booke, after it was past my hands plaied the Cuckow with me, and laied some egges of his in my nest. As <hi>pag. 549. lin. 27.</hi> where I had saied, <hi>M.</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> Bishop <hi>according to his ignorance,</hi> he made it, <hi>M.</hi> Bishop <hi>according to his opinion muffled in the mists of ignorance.</hi> Likewise <hi>pag. 762. l. 38.</hi> where I had said, <hi>these are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the fornications of the whoore of Babylon, things reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, witlesse, senselesse, meere wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and inchauntments of mens mindes,</hi> he hath added, <hi>and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fruits of a barren strumpet.</hi> These two I noted obscurely before, though I did not signifie by what means they came in, which now I thought good to doe. Another edition, if neede be, and God so will, shall expunge these and the rest of these slouens blots; in the meane time, I pray thee, passe them ouer, if thou finde any more of the same kinde.</p>
