   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY EARLE OF <hi>Southampton,</hi> Baron of <hi>Tichfield,</hi> Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, Captaine of the Ile of <hi>Weight, and one of his Maiesties</hi> most honorable Priuy Councell.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Present vnto your <hi>Lordships</hi> view, the Modell of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> vnworthy I confesse, either of their publike life, or of so transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a protection; modestly framed for the Pulpit, not curiously adorned for the Presse: wherein your Lordship may behold <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Papal Rome,</hi> so mutually intertexed and folded vp into one <hi>Masse</hi> or <hi>Chaos,</hi> that you may safely pronounce the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then City to liue in this they call <hi>Christian:</hi> Yea, such is the dependancy, that if this <hi>Iezabel</hi> were stripped out of those Robes of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> she would well-nigh goe naked.</p>
   <p>Many nations were conuerted to <hi>Christ</hi> by the preaching of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> Yet wee finde not such an honorable attribute gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to any of his Auditors, as to those who are said, <hi>To haue</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>receiued the Word with readinesse, and to haue searched the Scriptures dayly, to see whether the things preached by S.</hi> Paul <hi>were so or not:</hi> For they are stiled by the best Record <hi>Noble men.</hi> And nothing (Sir) hath added, or can adde more true noblenesse to all your other great Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then the like Zealous affections and actions in you to the Word of God, deliuered by his Ministers.</p>
   <p>The dayly enlargement whereof in your <hi>Lordship,</hi> being Zealously coueted by my selfe: who although I am the weakest Labourer in Gods Vineyard, yet I haue presumed humbly to offer to your <hi>Lordship</hi> this little cluster of Grapes gathered from thence, and which I did lately in a Sermon deliuer vnto the Auditory then present: which if your <hi>Lordship</hi> will vouchsafe to take into your hands, to bruise it a little more, and to see and taste whether it sprung from the true Vine or not: I shall haue good hope that yet a little iuyce may thereby flow from thence to refresh some weake ones in the Church of God.</p>
   <p>Which being the onely businesse that God hath set mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, by <hi>any meanes to saue some;</hi> And all I haue to say to your <hi>Lordship</hi> at this time: With my humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your <hi>Lordships</hi> great fauours, and my hearty prayers to God to encrease dayly your Zeale to his true worship: I rest</p>
