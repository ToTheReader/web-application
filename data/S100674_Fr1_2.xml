   <head>To Gentlemen, and those that <hi>are gentle.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>SVbiects may seeme scarce, or Printers lacke worke, when a Cormorant flies into the Presse, yet Cormorants oppresse and therefore worthy to be prest; but my Cormorant hath neither dipt his tongue in oile to smooth the faults of the vicious, nor stop'd his mouth to conceale the merits of the vertuous: I haue thought good to sympathize a subiect fit for the time, and I haue done my best to handle it in a sutable straine.</p>
   <p>The Cormorant is not easily induced to affability, nor I to flattery.</p>
   <p>His best seruice is harsh and vnsociable, so is my style. His biting is sharpe and piercing, so is my phrase. His throat is wide and spacious, my subiect is spacious. His co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is blacke, I discouer deeds of darknesse. He grubs and spuddles for his prey in muddy holes and obscure cauerns, my Muse ferrits base debaushed wretches in their swinish dens. He like the <hi>Crocodile</hi> moues the vpper chap, this Treatise condemnes that beasts dissimulation. He swallows downe his meate without taste, this booke distastes such as sinne without touch of conscience.</p>
   <p>The ods is, my Cormorants appetite is limited, but most of theirs is vnsatiable.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>I ayme not at such mens slips as may fall by infirmity, for that were like <hi>Esops</hi> crab, to offer to teach others to goe right, going crooked my selfe.</p>
   <p>Detraction is a priuate wounding of a mans name, and flattery a deuourer of men aliue. If I can sayle betwixt these two, and not be split, I shall ariue at my desired port.</p>
   <p>In my passage I shall haue <hi>Polipheme</hi> casting Rockes to sincke me, Criticks misconstruing my words, like spiders sucking poyson out of wholesome flowers.</p>
   <p>But from these Antipodes to goodnesse, by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis to nature, I appeale to my conscience which is a witnesse to me that can neither accuse or condemne me.</p>
   <p>I ayme at none but such as deuoure others, and yet make shift to keepe themselues out of the reach of law, I name none personally, and therefore wish the faulty to amend with silence rather then by rubbing of a spot to make a hole in the whole cloath, for I leaue gleanings enough to make a second part if need require. Such stomacks as cannot digest this dish, let me rather be to them a choake peare then a Gudgeon.</p>
   <p>There is no degree of man or woman, whatsoeuer, from the Court to the Cottage, or from the Pallace to the Plough, but may make good vse of this Poem, either for merry recreation, or vices defamation: and in a word, if it please the iudicious, or be any way profitable to the confirming of the good, or reforming the bad, I have then my full recompence, with the effect of my intentions and wishes.</p>
