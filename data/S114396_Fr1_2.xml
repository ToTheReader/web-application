   <head>TO THE RIGHT
REVERENDE FATHER IN GOD,

Increase of all true zeale,

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT gracious, and my very good
Lorde (if in any measure I coulde haue
better deuised, consonant with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my slender faculties how for so
many your honourable great fauours to
mee worthlesse, neyther of any the least
deserueable: publiquely to divulge, and
promulgate the reuerende gratuitye which I still by numberlesse
respects of duetie, pretend and beare to your worthinesse) it should
haue beene euen in the mightiest power of my wittes, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousest
indeuors more (though not better) manifested. But since
it both proceedeth from a francke spirite, &amp; the chiefest treasures
of my better parte: I beseech your good Lordship (not onely as in
tollerating this boldenesse braunching from the firme confidence
of my meere loue and duetie, but that also in gracious admittance
of your honourable Patronage) you would dignifie these spirituall
Poemes: which this last yeere in my late litle trauails had through
some partes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> (as tribute of that measure of witte, and
inuention, which it hath pleased almighty God of his super aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
grace, and mercie to endue my feeble spirite withall) I daily


<pb facs="3"/>
to his honour and seruice by prescribed taske, deuoted. And albeit
it nothing neere (by millions of sacred degrees) attayneth to
the glorie of this diuine subiect, and argument: yet was it written
(I call his sacred Maiestie to record, that I neyther for vayne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
nor my iustification speake it) in liuely touche, motion, and
feeling-anguishe of spirite, voyde of all colourable varnishe, and
hypocrisie: and therefore more fitte for their spirituall consolatiō
to bee perused of diuerse, whome numerous Orations moue much
more then proase: and to that ende these (at motion of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
my wel-deseruing friendes) I haue committed to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
tipographicall Theatre of generall censure, which if they
shall his omnipotencie (in whose honour by mee most vnworthie
vassall of sinne and mortallitie they were composed) please, then
am I most pleased, fortunate, and comforted for euer. And then
I doubt not but they shall also hightly stande with your Lordshippes
good liking and contentment: to whome if in fauour these shall
in this worlde passe, I much lesse depende of other mens opinions:
referring them alone (next vnder God) to your honours vertuous
protection, and the protection of your honour to the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour,
and disposer of all honours and blessinges. With which I
beseech his mightinesse indue your good Lordship, and yours to his
best pleasure and your deere soules comforte. From London this
30. of August. 1595.</p>
