   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aster <hi>Buchanan,</hi> though some call you the trumpet of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and some the noble Scholler, yet I will be so bold, as answere your larum, touching the history of mighty <hi>Brute:</hi> because your inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue treatise, is in trueth, more fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, then effectuall. You and such hotbraines, haue deuised a faction, and diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of opinions, (I dare say) without fruit, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, without cause: For my part, your deniall is not able once to moue me, and your reasons against <hi>Brutes</hi> historie, shall neuer perswade any sufficient reader, to agree with you, and remoue the markes and circuites, that <hi>Geffry Monmouth</hi> hath set downe. Yet by reading your allegations and probations, we may best areede, who is most credible, he or you, a <hi>Monmouth</hi> or a <hi>Scot,</hi> a <hi>Moonke</hi> or a <hi>Trauailer,</hi> and if neither barrell be better her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then by their wordes they shalbe saued from blame, and by their wordes they shalbe damned, sayth the wise Iudge: wherefore I take you of your worde, and I say: that</p>
   <p>We <hi>seeke</hi> no <hi>Noilitie,</hi> from <hi>Brute,</hi> we count not of our forefathers noblenesse, but of our owne. Nobilitie I can tell you, goeth not by byrth and riches in <hi>Brutany,</hi>
      <pb n="2" facs="4"/>
but by vertue: it standeth not vpon <hi>antiquitie,</hi> but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on right: we euer say, that <hi>noblenesse</hi> is a superioritie or dominion in vertuous actes, and that other thinges without vertue are but minoritie and subiection, and colours, and naught worth.</p>
   <p>We cannot thinke that <hi>Brute</hi> was <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>atricide:</hi> let them that iudge him so, proue him so. I passe not for that he hath done aforetime <hi>in other landes,</hi> but I onely respect his Actiōs in this Iland. Yet, if he were in that huge and maine fault, hee may well enter into Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, till you and yours haue proued the deede volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Mishap is not rashnesse, chaunce is not counsell, there is a folly in meeting <hi>an arrowe,</hi> there is no sinne in shooting it at a beast in the forrest.</p>
   <p>We <hi>compare not <hi>Brutus</hi>
      </hi> with <hi>Romulus,</hi> no more then we compare your Chronicle now with this that shall write one <hi>200.</hi> or <hi>300.</hi> yeares heereafter: but this is your florish, to no other purpose, then to shew reading, where it doth no good, and may do some little hurt to a young Reader; who by your wordes will go nigh to say, that <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> are much of a time, because you set them together in a Chronicle, which should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that is past, or record that is present onely.</p>
   <p>We are not <hi>Brittons,</hi> we are <hi>Brutans:</hi> we account not <hi>Brute</hi> our <hi>authour</hi> &amp; <hi>founder,</hi> seeing here dwelt as Noble men afore <hi>Brute</hi> as euer since that time. No good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or bad, hath been without noble men from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and to let go all Histories, I dare say this word, That nature hath made as auncient a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men vpon the earth, as of other creatures, and of chiefe men in their companies at first, aswell as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chiefe creatures in their kindes and their heardes
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
at first, yea and much rather of men, because of more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and order.</p>
   <p>We speake not of <hi>Brutes wealth</hi> and <hi>language,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came hither, neither can you proue, that hee had not wealth inough to serue his vses, or tongue enough in euery place of his trauell. Cannot an Egle flie from place to place, and take heere a lambe, there a kid, here a goose, there a swanne, vnlesse hee can speake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of lambes, and kids and geese and swannes? what traffique should a venturer haue with any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he hath set all the earth or one part therof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to make himselfe king in some place or other? He will not aske, what price beareth your marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise? but a <hi>Brute</hi> will haue it for taking: hee will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue your <hi>commercies,</hi> and throw you into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, if you giue him not whatsoeuer you would not, whensoeuer he will.</p>
   <p>What if the <hi>Romans coulde scarsely set foote in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when they were <hi>in their greatest fortune</hi> and <hi>strength?</hi> could not <hi>Brute</hi> therefore possibly get into it? how know you, whether his natiuitie, or his good hap, or his maner of entering, were not better or happier then <hi>Caesars?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If one company cannot enter by force, cannot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company enter by wit and fairer meanes? It is not <hi>number,</hi> nor <hi>money</hi> that make a Conquerour, it is good successe, which commeth of a good forecast, that is in a <hi>Grecian</hi> more then in a <hi>Roman,</hi> and why not in <hi>Brute</hi> more then in <hi>Caesar?</hi> If <hi>Brutes</hi> Chronicles had been preserued aswell as <hi>Caesars,</hi> I doubt not of this matter and of <hi>Brutes</hi> immortalitie in all writinges, then <hi>Caesar</hi> had beene halfe a <hi>Brute.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb n="4" facs="5"/>We haue not any thing heere for <hi>Italians,</hi> till wee be serued our selues, we are onely in <hi>Brutanie</hi> and among <hi>Brutans.</hi> Let other men haue leaue to speake of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Latium,</hi> of <hi>Ianus</hi> and <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> and other thinges before <hi>Brute,</hi> who might be among his neighbours, as singular and fortunate a man for foresight, as <hi>Noah</hi> was among the men of former times. It is no reason that <hi>Brute</hi> coulde not be giuen to trauell, because <hi>the Italians were not giuen to trauelling, among whome</hi> you say <hi>hee dwelt</hi> afore. So you may deny almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actors Actes, that hath liued admirably in the worlde. It may bee, that <hi>Brute</hi> and is fellowes swornemen were worth all the rest in liuely and manly action abroad, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company were singular among the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and proued the rare man of the world.</p>
   <p>Wee say not, that <hi>Brute walked on the Sea,</hi> or <hi>came</hi> hither <hi>by land,</hi> and therefore your <hi>Alpes,</hi> and your <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> haue no present vse, but as table talke to passe time, and make a noyse. Yet men hauing liued more then <hi>2800.</hi> yeares from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi> vppon the earth, and <hi>Comer</hi> the sonne of <hi>Lamech,</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Sabati,</hi> and other great men lying in <hi>Italy</hi> before <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was borne, and seeking out the partes of the earth euery way, we can beleeue reasonably, that they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the <hi>Alpes</hi> before him. Or if <hi>Hercules</hi> must needes be the onely man, what a single reason is it? that <hi>Brute</hi> might not follow him that way, because <hi>Hercules</hi> onely had gone before. I had rather conclude thus: <hi>Hercules</hi> made a way through <hi>the Alpes</hi> so easily, that any hardy trauailer might followe him that way. Since <hi>Brutes</hi> time the <hi>Alpes</hi> haue been passable enough, and the
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
      <hi>Gaules</hi> haue ouerrunned them; and other people trode on them, your <hi>Adhuc alienis</hi> is somwhat vnskilfully writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of you.</p>
   <p>Truely I would <hi>Tamerlane</hi> were euen now here, to answere your <hi>Ocean</hi> argument: hee could tell you, that his <hi>multitude</hi> of <hi>rude Scythians</hi> and shepheardes could do more Actes then all the fine gay troopes and rankes of <hi>Baiazete,</hi> that it is no good consequent which you bring forth, as if the <hi>Albane shepheardes</hi> and <hi>clownes</hi> might not be as valiant in vanquishing <hi>the Alpes,</hi> as the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> souldiers: vnlesse it be an infallible Item, that the iolliest men are euer greatest actors by sea and land: your argument <hi>à maiori</hi> is easily set <hi>à minori</hi> in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The lightheaded <hi>Grecians</hi> and such other haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>the Ocean,</hi> much more is it probable, that the manly and most hardy <hi>Albanes</hi> haue done the same thing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither lesse wit by comparison of their Actes, nor lesse courage in any point. The actions of one doe not proue any thing of another, but of that one <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra:</hi> or else howe should we haue argumentes of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, of vnequals, of vnlikes, of diuisions? or if your reason be an historie, I see no cause, why mine historie of <hi>Brute,</hi> may not be credited aswell as yours of <hi>the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silians,</hi> who were long enough after <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shippes of other men, I beleeue, to <hi>haue some aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> in shipmastry and many fellowes. He that goeth <hi>aspying</hi> goeth aspeeding: <hi>opportunitie</hi> maketh men doe straunge workes: haue you neuer heard of players and iesters, that by deuises of games and pastimes haue obtained very great victories? Remember man, I say, the famous and strong name of <hi>Brute,</hi> and consider the nature of warly trauailers, and neuer stand so stiffly
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
in your naked <hi>coniecture.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>How knoweth <hi>Buchanan,</hi> that there was <hi>no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Brute in the world before the bannishment of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quines in Rome?</hi> might there not be another <hi>Brute <hi>500.</hi>
      </hi> yeares before this counterfeit <hi>Brute of Rome?</hi> or was there none such, are you sure, because the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Historians of other nations, forsooth, haue made no such record? It is no sufficient reason, to carry <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> from their owne old Registers by the wordes and silence of outlandish writers. You knowe and I am sure, there are no meane matters left out of prophane Histories, which are in ecclesiasticall Histories, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse allowed. The more they leaue out the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our land, the more I presume by the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries, that our land was enuied, because it was most glorious. I tell you I cannot thinke it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, that he which is named <hi>Brute</hi> in our Chronicle must bee so named in other Chronicles: the same man may haue diuers names seuerally set downe in seueral bookes of seuerall languages, and as for this most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Brute,</hi> it is like enough, he chaunged his name, as he chaunged his habitation.</p>
   <p>You may easily say, <hi>A Moonke was the deuiser of this Brute,</hi> you will say, that <hi>he played the Poet,</hi> that hee carued &amp; painted him in this maner: but you cannot yet proue in this hast, that <hi>the Moonke</hi> or student had not good proofe in his readings of this <hi>Brute,</hi> that he had not his Authour for them. It is out of question, that manie books haue been written but once, and that many such singular bookes haue been lost for want of coppies, and it is probable, that this <hi>Moonke</hi> had some olde monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or booke, which may bee in <hi>Cambry</hi> to this day,
<pb n="7" facs="6"/>
though <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Liuy</hi> neuer heard of it, and may be as true of <hi>Brute,</hi> as their olde <hi>Scottish Thinges</hi> and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Decades are accounted true by their fauourers and countrimen. If <hi>the historie of Brute be not true,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not seene the proofe thereof, no more is their historie true, because we haue not seene the proofe thereof, which was acted so many yeares ere we were borne: thus it is as lawfull to <hi>coniecture</hi> for <hi>Brute</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, seeing he is but denied onely by <hi>coniectures</hi> and probabilities.</p>
   <p>But what is this you say? are <hi>mens mouthes stopped with a</hi> maske and <hi>shewe of Religion?</hi> cannot men tell what to say against <hi>A shewe</hi> and appearance? doe men that name the heathenish <hi>religion</hi> account it religion in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome? I warrant you, <hi>the Moonke</hi> was so far from purposing, <hi>to stop mens mouthes</hi> with <hi>the idolatry of Diana,</hi> that he neuer esteemed halfe the tenth part so much of her, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> did for his profite in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and I dare say, that the <hi>Religious</hi> Authour thought it no <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or imagined, that the <hi>Brutanes</hi> would so esteeme it, but onely named <hi>Diana,</hi> as <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> are named of <hi>S. Luke</hi> the Euangelist.</p>
   <p>Your Synchronisme of <hi>Faunus,</hi> of <hi>Sybilla</hi> and <hi>Praene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> is to no purpose: it seemeth by this History of <hi>Brute,</hi> that <hi>Dianaes Oracle was</hi> not <hi>vnknowne,</hi> as you seeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch. But heere you will take <hi>the Moonke</hi> at a dead lift, as you suppose, and yet I tell you me-thinkes you and very bookishly and literally wise, not reasonably and discoursiuely. Must <hi>Diana</hi> needes <hi>speake latine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Historian reporteth <hi>her Oracle in latine?</hi> Are you not aduised, how many things are writtē in Greek and <hi>Latine</hi> of the Beginning of the world, though there
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
were neither Greeke nor <hi>Latine <hi>2000.</hi>
      </hi> yeares and more after the Creation of heauen and earth? and such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might partly be brought against your selfe in your first <hi>king Fergusius,</hi> if I would follow so needlesse a cause, in comparing his time with the times of <hi>the latine tongue,</hi> wherein you write of him. You might haue done well, to proue that <hi>the Moonke</hi> saith, howe <hi>Brute</hi> receiued his answere of <hi>Diana,</hi> and asked her Counsell in <hi>latine speach,</hi> which because you haue not proued, your <hi>Horatius</hi> and your <hi>Saliare carmen,</hi> and your <hi>Numa,</hi> and your wordes are but winde. Cannot an Historian report the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi> of the <hi>Numidians</hi> in <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> vnlesse the <hi>Numidians</hi> &amp; <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> spake <hi>latine?</hi> were the Orations in your Chronicles, Master <hi>Buchanan,</hi> spoken first in <hi>latine?</hi> So your <hi>Penitus obliti</hi> and <hi>ne tenue quidem,</hi> and other bootlesse words are vain and little, or nought worth in this present question. Tis not euer true that hath a <hi>quidem.</hi> I cannot certainly say, that <hi>the Brutans language</hi> was <hi>vsed in Italy in the dayes of Brute:</hi> but I may well say, notwithstanding your trifling <hi>mycterisme,</hi> that if the Oracles and men had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, they had been neuer the worse, nor <hi>the language</hi> neuer the better. But you were in a running thought and supposed your selfe subtle enough, when you had brought your inuention to a disiunctiue proposition, with much effect, I promise you, when it tendeth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, euen to proue, that <hi>the Brutan speach then was not the same our Brutans vse</hi> now in <hi>Cambry.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Yet by your leaue, <hi>Buchanan,</hi> it is no proofe against <hi>this language,</hi> in that <hi>many tongues appeare in it</hi> in your time, seeing <hi>Brutanisme</hi> might at first bee as full of diuerse <hi>tongues</hi> by reason of much trauell as it is nowe, and then
<pb n="9" facs="7"/>
your argument hath nor vse nor force in your question: and in trueth, though <hi>Scots</hi> be called generally false, yet <hi>Buchanan</hi> may be true: so <hi>Moonks</hi> may <hi>dreame dreames,</hi> and yet <hi>Geffry Monmouth</hi> write a trueth. Why should not a <hi>Moonke</hi> be as credible as a <hi>Paedanty?</hi> or a solitarie student vnderstand that he readeth as much as a busie schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master? or a <hi>Cambrian</hi> read Chronicles which a <hi>Scot</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer saw? or <hi>Geffry</hi> be as plaine and verifiable as <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> being not so deep ouer head and eares in verses and <hi>Poetry</hi> as he? yet now at last the <hi>George</hi> confesseth, that his owne <hi>reasons</hi> are but <hi>minims,</hi> and minute persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and slender thinges, and is faine to say, that <hi>the Moonke</hi> himselfe <hi>seemeth to acknowledge his fiction,</hi> though it appeareth not so by <hi>the Moonkes</hi> wordes. Thus it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued euidently, that <hi>the history of Brute is a</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and <hi>poeticall narration,</hi> vnlesse it be first proued, that there were no more Intelligences and Registers in the life of <hi>Geffrey</hi> then of <hi>George,</hi> and that <hi>Geffrey</hi> had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for his defence, because <hi>George</hi> cannot knowe them. If nothing be true in one country which <hi>hath not suffragees from another Countrey,</hi> I cannot tell what historie may stand irrefragably by this determination, no not when we read the auncientest partes and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue recordes of best historiographers. Was there not an Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> because <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> name none such? much <hi>Iustine</hi> teach the <hi>Iewes</hi> howe to thinke of the deliuery of <hi>Israel?</hi> But I omit those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which might be giuē against you, because in a question I regard the argument more then the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and so should you too by your leaue, for all your <hi>24. yeares trauell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Are they <hi>malè callidi,</hi> and is <hi>vanitie</hi> in them that call
<pb n="10" facs="8"/>
      <hi>Diana an huntresse</hi> and say, that <hi>in the time of Brute Diana was accounted a Goddesse?</hi> I confesse, I cānot see, how they are <hi>lewdly</hi> and <hi>fraudulently vaine</hi> that write thus: then it remaineth, that you make these words good, if you can: The <hi>chast</hi> body the painfull bodie, but <hi>labour</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie in mans body breede a kinde of <hi>diuinitie</hi> in man. I pray, when you in your Psalmes, as they call them yours, deuise the <hi>most kindes of verses</hi> that you can, do you confesse, that <hi>Dauid</hi> made them at first in <hi>so many sortes of verses</hi> as you haue written them? surely you will denie it. Iwis, it is not necessarie, that <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> should <hi>speake verses,</hi> because <hi>Geffry Monmouth recordeth their wordes in verses.</hi> But, let be, suppose they did <hi>speake</hi> in these or in other <hi>verses,</hi> then he, doubtlesse, or some other for him translated their words into hexameters and pentameters, as you see. What <hi>vanitie</hi> or <hi>falshood</hi> is on either side? neuer thinke to carry it away with threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare wordes, or to leade your Readers where you list.</p>
   <p>A wise perswader are you: is <hi>Diana called Loxias</hi> in your bookes? or if <hi>Apollo</hi> be <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>crooked,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate</hi> in his answeres, must <hi>Diana</hi> needes be so? or if <hi>Dianaes Priest</hi> be commonly <hi>obscure</hi> &amp; <hi>foulded vp</hi> in speach, cannot it be, that hee should be perspicuous at anie one time? are you to appoint him how to speake so manie yeares after his death? I pray, if <hi>Pythia be euer doubtfull,</hi> and <hi>oblique,</hi> because shee is so for the most part, what <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> or <hi>obliquitie</hi> is in this aunswere? <hi>You are come to my rich temples, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> beloued of God and of all that inhabite the heauenly houses, I am in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should call thee a mon or a God, but I much rather beleeue, that thou art a God, <hi>Lycurgus,</hi>
      </hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath recorded in his <hi>Clio:</hi> and what <hi>ambiguitie</hi> is in that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb n="11" facs="8"/>
which <hi>Pythia</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Craesus</hi> in the same booke of <hi>Herodotus?</hi> what saye to <hi>Aristodocus</hi> in the same booke, who neither asked <hi>in verse</hi> nor was answered <hi>in verse?</hi> what saye to them of <hi>Marea</hi> and <hi>Apia,</hi> which asked <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Oracle in prose, and were answered in prose? as it appeareth in <hi>Euterpe.</hi> What saye to the Doue of <hi>Dodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or the Oracle of the cittie <hi>Butis</hi> giuen to <hi>Pheron</hi> that spake in prose? in the same booke: to let passe such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres a good manie giuen without <hi>verse</hi> or <hi>ambiguitie:</hi> Or if they were giuen in <hi>verse</hi> being nowe written o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise with allowance of Readers, what hath <hi>the Moonke</hi> done amisse in the maner of these <hi>verses?</hi> he may aswell register prose <hi>in verse,</hi> as they register <hi>verse</hi> in prose.</p>
   <p>As for your <hi>Opinor,</hi> this may bee well answered in your verball manner, <hi>O pinor narras? non rectè accipis:</hi> you know the maker <hi>Terentius.</hi> I that am young may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well bestowe my labour to answere you, as you being olde may obiect so vnfruitfully. Howe is that proued <hi>a manifest fiction that this Iland at Brutes comming was a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,</hi> being yet so this daie still in manie places? Can <hi>two Gyantes</hi> and their two families, or so manie <hi>Giantes</hi> as make an Armie, so fill this countrie, that it shall not rightly be called <hi>a desart?</hi> when they are all in one shire, the other shires are verie <hi>desarts:</hi> when they being so few, are scattered into so manie shires betweene the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the <hi>Ile of Wight,</hi> how can they so fill it, that it may not be well <hi>named of Diana a desart?</hi> in comparison of the Cities and Kingdomes in other landes, where she abode most.</p>
   <p>The <hi>name of Gogmagog</hi> is no more <hi>monstrous</hi> then the name of <hi>Onosconcoleros,</hi> nor <hi>Tentagol</hi> more <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>strange</hi>
      <pb n="12" facs="9"/>
then <hi>Nabuchodonozor,</hi> neither shall those <hi>Names</hi> preiudice the Historie more with vs then these <hi>Names</hi> haue done with other in the Historie of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus I may verie iustly and reasonably maintaine and vphold <hi>the historie of Brute,</hi> for anie thing that master <hi>Buchanan</hi> hath said against it. Concerning <hi>Dioclesian and his daughters,</hi> I haue willingly lost all that delight of reading and answering, although I see euidently, that <hi>this Historie</hi> which you account <hi>a tale</hi> may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ought you haue alledged. Yet master <hi>Buchanan</hi> taketh much vpon him and chargeth some bodie with <hi>impudencie and a lye,</hi> and plaieth the Terrible schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and yet when he hath done his best and his worst, it is not proued, that <hi>24.</hi> yeares were not <hi>sufficient</hi> for <hi>Brutes</hi> retinue, and the inhabitantes of this land, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other of their kindred that resorted hither and remained here, <hi>to replenish the Country</hi> with men of War, <hi>to erect three kingdomes, to accomplish great Actes</hi> by sea and land. Let him looke into the <hi>kingdomes</hi> of <hi>Grecia</hi> in olde time, and he shall finde fewer men in a kingdome then <hi>Brute</hi> alone with his companie might raise in <hi>24. <hi>yeares:</hi>
      </hi> let him remember the huge <hi>kingdomes</hi> of three men, <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet:</hi> let him consider, that mightie <hi>Actions</hi> are not done by <hi>money and number,</hi> but by industry and vertue: let him proue, eyther that <hi>this Generation of Brute cannot</hi> possibly <hi>be true,</hi> or else cease to spend his time with <hi>opinions</hi> and likelihoodes, that may be repelled with the like againe: rusty <hi>Antiquities</hi> more reuerend then scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nouelties. Yet, <hi>we</hi> are not <hi>desirous,</hi> that <hi>Brute</hi> should be <hi>our Conquerour, we wish</hi> not subiection to him, or anie other outlandish Nobleman: we had rather winne the land that this <hi>Brute</hi> came from, and subdue it vnder
<pb n="13" facs="9"/>
our feete: but when <hi>Brutans</hi> haue published <hi>an Historie</hi> and allowed it a long time, we would not haue a <hi>Scot</hi> so presumptuous, as to <hi>controll</hi> it, much lesse to <hi>reiect</hi> it, as this one <hi>Scot</hi> hath done very rawly and vnaduisedly.</p>
   <p>So I leaue you, master <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and wishe you to sacrifice vnto the wiser dimi-goddesse <hi>Palinodia.</hi>
