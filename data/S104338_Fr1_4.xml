   <p>THE differences that are pretended are either in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, or doctrine, or translation. For exceptions are made in everie of these. Wee contrarywise can finde no such fault <hi>in the last communion booke authorized by his Maiestie.</hi> Now therefore good Reader (who thou art in the worlds account, because I know not, &amp; may faile in giving titles of that estimation, as thy honor, worship, or credit may wel exact.

<pb n="11" facs="6"/>are, wherein we and others must and may consent: which when thou hast advisedly perused, say where the fault is.</p>
   <p>First no Church of God since the daies of the Apostles, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but had some ceremonies more or lesse. Secondly, no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> flat opposite, or by necessarie sequel contrarie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the word of God to be allowed. Thirdly, in such cases, as the word of God neither implies, nor expresly forbids, or commands, we are to looke, what we receiue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, order, and edification. Fourthly, care to bee had, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> what our Fathers in the purer times haue thought fit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and comely, that we deeme not our selues wiser then they, nor shun their fellowship in so many points, as wee may possibly, and peaceably inioie with them.

   <p>The next thing is whether any point of doctrine is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue in the booke of Common praier. And herein these short conclusions we propose.

<pb n="15" facs="8"/>The partie a man Master <hi>Calvin</hi> much respected, yet because done without his privitie, howe is the action censured for rash, ignorant, and giddie. Was Maister <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in Geneva, and in those Churches for authority, more then our Bishops in their Diocesse, or was that citty grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our kingdome, or their Burgesses, and Maisters of their towne able to doe more then the Kings Maiesty, and the Lords of his Councell with vs for repressing disorders? Compare the causes, how many for one blundred among our people contrary to the booke of Articles agreed vpon by our whole Church: how hotly pursued by those, as haue evil wil to our government, and governours? How many motions, admonitions, petitions, supplications, al of them far more destitute of scripture, then this particular of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, as followeth to bee shewed. They who would haue vs to propose other Churches for our example meane not (we hope) herein we should. For if they doe a sharpe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment wilbe the reward of violent gaine-saying. Lastly to conclude: in a point twixt our selues varied vpon, if there be a phrase in the Communion booke, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue vsed, shoulde any late writer impugne it, the matter is not great. For this rule is to be agreed vpon.<note place="margin">Nullus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
