   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      <hi>Wrote to my Sonne, Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel at</hi> Roven, <hi>desiring him to set downe in a paper (distinctly and clearely) his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inion concerning the Sabbath, with the confirmation thereof by such arguments which hee should thinke most pregnant, and a solide refutation of the contrary arguments; which he did accordingly, but in the French Tongue, as writing onely out of a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection to condescend to my desire, not thinking, and far lesse desiring it should be Englished and made publike here: Neither had I any such intention, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most unwilling that he, who is a stranger to this nation, although not a stranger to the Church, should goe formost to breake this yee. And therefore I kept it
<pb facs="3"/>
by me three yeeres, till being advertised that others were gone before, and their Bookes were on the Presse, and finding no man that would or could translate it into our Tongue, and take the wearisome paines to place the additions (which he sent me at divers times afterwards) in their roomes: I undertooke this labour my selfe, hoping that things being compared with things, cause with cause, reasons with reasons, and the contrary arguments, which are to be found in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bookes, for and against the morality of a seventh day of a weekly Sabbath, being examined and conferred one by another, the Christian, charitable, and judicious Readers shall be stirred up, after</hi> they have proved <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 21.</note> all things, to hold fast that which is good, <hi>without imparing any thing of that religious service which they owe and yeeld publikely in the Church, and privately at home with their families to the Lord their God, who needs not the errours of men (though never so speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) for the upholding of his service. If in this end of my translation I have done any thing amisse, I say with</hi> David, Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a <note place="margin">Psal. 141. v. 5.</note> kindnes, and let him reprove me, it shall be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent oile, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> shall not breake mine head. <hi>In the meane while, let all Christians, according to the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Apostle,</hi> put off anger, wrath, malice, <note place="margin">Col. 3. v. 8, 14.</note>
      <hi>and</hi> put on charity, which is the bond of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>and so</hi> walk worthy of the vocation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. v. 1, 2, 3.</note> we are called, with all lowlines and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with long suffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, endeavouring to keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace; <hi>that</hi> living in <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. v. 11,</note> peace, the God of love and peace may be with us, <hi>and live in us for ever and ever.</hi>
