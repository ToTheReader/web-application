   <head>To the Iudicious Reader, health.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> Am not ignorant (courteous Reader) of the old adage; <hi>He that seeks to please all men, shall never finish his task;</hi> for there is no piec so accurately done, but some (either through ignorance or envie) will espie conceited faults in it; let <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> draw his picture with never so much art and iudgement the <hi>Cobler</hi> will find a hole in his coate; let an Author write as learnedly as <hi>Homer,</hi> were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, he shall be subiect to the cavilling censure of <hi>Zoilus;</hi> no marvell
<pb facs="5"/>
then if I the most unperfect vassall of the Muses be scoft for my endeuour, when the best deservings Artist is not free: but my hope is that though <hi>I</hi> be condemned by the ignorant <hi>Momus,</hi> or envious <hi>Critick,</hi> I shall be bayld by the learned and iudicious, to whom I only send my Booke: for the rest, as they cannot be bar'd from reading, so I will not hinder them from their owne opinions: which when they have, their gaine is litle, and my losse is lesse. If my <hi>Nightingales song</hi> please the honest and intellectuall man, she hath her wish, for she sings not to please knaves and fooles: nor can they hurt her much: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they shoote her dead with the arrowes of aspersion; but I thinke none is so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to hurt (much lesse to kill) a <hi>Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
therefore she is confident of her safety, and dares adventure into the world to warble forth her owne disaster. In her story you shall finde such woefull, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and tragicall discourse, that a heart of Adamant way find its invaliditie, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Goates blood which hath the vertue to dissolve it, when to all other meanes it is impenetrable. I have endeavored (as her Secretary) to pen her song, with as much skill as my little learning can produce, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if I have pleased the fancy of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Reader, <hi>I</hi> have hit the white, and gaind the fruition of my hopes; if not, all my Poetry is quite kild in the egge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good Reader, for the love thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to the Muses, iudge charitably now that <hi>I</hi> may be animated to proceede to thy
<pb facs="6"/>
future profit and pleasure. Which hoping thou wilt, doe <hi>I</hi> commit thee to the tuition of thy Maker, and rest,</p>
