   <p>THe first and auncient <hi>Philosophers</hi> that wrote their Poesies couertly hidden vnder subtill and wylie matter, did constitute <hi>Pallas</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to bee goddesse of Wisedome, called <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>arua,</hi> and of Warre, called <hi>Enyo</hi> or <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona.</hi> Giuing hereby to vnderstand, that of one and the same beginning, in one time altogether and in one substance are two principall things insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ioyned together: which two properties are so knit, that the one without the other is of no force, and the other without his fellow, of small or no account: Yea, they are the principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men attaine to the height of Honour, aduancing meane men to Honour in their life-time, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall fame after death. They are <hi>Learning</hi> and Martiall discipline. Of these two together Noble <hi>Greece</hi> made separation in her two metropolitanes; when the Citie of <hi>Athens</hi> flourished in learning, and the Citie of <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> glorious in feates of Armes. The noble fame of the <hi>Romanes</hi> grew by the one, and by the other they did alwayes defend them, so that they did successiuely greatly set store by them. The worthie, valiant, and mighty Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Caesar</hi> was decored with them both, and by
<pb facs="3"/>
them did eternise his renowne. These two which did so much ennoble <hi>Greece,</hi> so greatly honour the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and eternise the fame of the great <hi>Caesar,</hi> are in this present small volume comprised vnder an angry Argument, and Historicall narration of the <hi>Grammar Warre: Lucian</hi> an eloquent <hi>Greeke</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour made the first d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

the last end of their attemptes and endeauours, with all their circumstances, all their tumults and vproares, with their doubtfulnesse of victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many martialists, how of bloody battell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers losses and dangers doe follow, and how in the end finall peace ensueth. All which matters bee so properlie penned, and so cunningly compact in this tragedie, that the warres of the <hi>Poloponenses,</hi> and the ciuill warres of the <hi>Affricanes</hi> in <hi>Thucide,</hi> in <hi>Salust,</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> are peradueuture more high and diffusedly described: But with more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Heere are placed the mighty, huge, and fearefull factes of armes vnder the figure of so small a thing as of the congruitie or discordance of words in <hi>Oration,</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning letters with weapons, teaching the art Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie with the art Litterarie, so well, and so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Reader (beside the delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that hee shall haue in the reading of so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant an Allegorie) shall receiue further benefit: For herein is represented in one conceit, two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings knit together, the one proper and naturall, the other tropique and figured. Beside this, hee shall comprehend in this same very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and by the only labour of one reading, those two so worthy things aboue mentioned, that doe eternise the fame of their fellowes, that is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of learning, and prudent Martiallistes.
