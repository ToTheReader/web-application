AND TRVLY
Noble Lord, the Lord
GEORGE DIGBY,
Sonne and Heire of the Right
Honourable the Earle

   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honourable and
my very Good Lord,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to present
to your Lordships
Patronage, these
few Sermons of a deceased
worthy friend, it is not so
much the acknowledgment
of those great favours and
noble respects wherewith
you were pleased to grace
<pb facs="3"/>
Him, and since his death
haue vouchsafed to extend
to mee your vnworthy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
as a due consideration
(if in Dedicatiōs matchable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
be to be regarded (how
properly and peculiarly they
doe belong to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
both in respect of the
Authour and the Argument.
The Authour was one,
whom, for his singular dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in the Arts, depth
of iudgement, sharpnesse of
wit, and especially his skill in
languages, Hebrew, Greeke,
Arabicke, you were pleased
to make choice of for one of
your Readers during your
abode at <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxon,</hi> in which time you
<pb facs="3"/>
so obliged him by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
testimonies of your
good affection to him, that
He oft professed to mee how
great &amp; iust an interest your
merits claimed in all his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and labours. This which
you here see is but an Essay
to some master-peece which
you might haue expected, if
he had liued to finish what he
attempted in the Greek An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
&amp; obseruations on
the Hebrew Text. For the
matter, it being a Theame of
the weightiest businesse in
Christianity, the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of all; which if it bee
not first rooted in the heart,
all other our conclusions and
speculations in Diuinity will
<pb facs="4"/>
bee but like the building a
Castle in the ayre, and may
giue the soule content per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
of a rare speculation,
but cannot of a powerfull,
experimentall, soule-quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and soule sauing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
The Argument, I say,
being such, as I could not
harden my selfe against the
requests of some who desired
the publishing thereof for
the good many soules might
reape by it, so neither could
I thinke any, fitter to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
a Theam of piety, than
one who shewed himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, both a Patron &amp;
an example of it. I would be
as farre from flattery as you
are from the want of it, and I
<pb facs="4"/>
would not, you should
looke your selfe in a false
Glasse: ouerweening in any
man is a thing that exposeth
to secret contempt, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the weaknesse shall
be espied, but Great men so
much the more, by how
much they are the more
obserued, and haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oftner to come vpon the
stage. You remēber what
manner of man he was, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in his studies, deuout
&amp; strict in an holy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
the things you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in him, and imitated: A
singular O men, when No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mē begin betimes to be
countenancers of goodnes
and good men: so perseuere
<pb facs="5"/>
to doe like a good <hi>Obadiah</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 18.</note>
the Church shall blesse you
and God shall honour you,
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note>
      <hi>For those that honour him,
he will honour, and them that
despise him hee will couer
with shame,</hi> either by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them some notable
judgement, or by giuing
them vp to such headlong
courses and filthy vices,
whereby their honour shall
be stained, their estates wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
themselues and their
posterity ruined (it being
not vnusuall with God to
punish men by their owne
deuices and sinnes wherein
they delight.) And so doth
your Lordship perseuere to
doe, I will not load your
<pb facs="5"/>
modesty with a slender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of your owne worth:
What perhaps I ought to
say, your Lordship may
guesse by what the people
doe say of you, and what I
should commend vnto you
(if I were able or worthy)
by what the world expects
from you: I know there is
nothing more vaine then to
liue by opinion, by what
men say or expect; opinion
is but an ill rule and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our liues and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(another mans measure
being too long, or too short
for me) yet this vse we may
make of it; when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to applaud and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that which our selues
<pb facs="6"/>
haue the greatest reason to
study &amp; affect, it may serue
to raise our vertues to an
higher pitch, than our own
priuity could lightly bring
them, the loue &amp; practise of
any good increasing with
the acceptance it findes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
But I forget what I
haue in hand, I close all
with apprecatiō of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to your Lordship:
the God of <hi>Ioseph</hi> double
vpon you the blessings of
<hi>Ioseph,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 33. 13. 6.</note>
      <hi>Blessed let him
make you for the precious
things of Heauen, and of the
deep that coucheth beneath,
for the precious things of the
Earth, &amp; the fulnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>
but especially, <hi>for the
<pb facs="6"/>
good will of him, that dwelt
in the Bush: Doe worthily
in Ephratah;</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Ruth. 4. 11.</note>
      <hi>and bee you
famous in our Isreal:</hi> The
seeds of Vertue and pious
education wherewith your
tender yeeres haue beene
seasoned, let them budde
and yeeld their pleasant &amp;
wholsome fruit in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
I still trespasse. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,
