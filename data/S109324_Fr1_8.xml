were lyuing on this earth, but also to put the same in
writing, to the behoue of all that should come after:
I can not a litle marueyle at the stubberne disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

wherin the noble arte of Chirurgerie is as it were falne into ruyne.</p>
   <p>For where as in tyme paste there were fewe Chirurgiens, &amp; they

iewels or honorable treasures of the common weale: Ther are
nowe many, and the moste parte ignorant, wherby they are founde
rather hurtfull then profitable: yea very caterpyllers to the publique
orders. So that in this case, the tyme present, beyng compared with
the tyme past, may be lykened to suche people as would plucke downe
in a realme, a hundred castels or strong defensed fortes whiche were
made for the faulregarde of the countrey: and in steade therof buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

      </gap> a fewe number for the greater?</p>
   <p>What was the cause that Lanfranke wrote so earnestly to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that he should kepe his worke from the sighte of ignorant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

come, that through the abusion of so many insipient and suche rustical
professiors of that arte, it would at the last come to ruine and extreame
decaye: so that whatsoeuer therin was ordeyned to the profite of men
and their helpe in necessite, should nowe through suche beastes abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the same, be the next waye to perdition of lyfe and members?</p>
   <p>Did not Galen here as it were plainly prophecie in his time: which
was about a thousande .iii. hundred, and .lxxx. yeres past; (for he was
famous, and floryshed in this lyfe, about the yere of Christ .178. in the
tyme of Marcus Aurelius Antonius emperour of Rome.) For he
playnly sayde, (when he wrote against Thessains:) if phisicke were
not vnitted, with other learnynges, that all maner of vyle ocupaciens,
would leaue their labour, and become phisitiens: Whiche is come to
passe at this daye. Which doubtlesse hath chaunced, not because the
medicinall arte, may nowe better wante those worthy pointes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then in tymes paste it might: But rather it hath chaunced, bothe
through wante of lawes for the prohibition of the same, and executiōs
of them that are: and also (yea chiefly) by the slouthfull negligence of
the professors of the same. So that to a number, they haue been and
are so worne out of mynde, that howe profitable (yea and what they

   <p>But howefarre the mynde and opinion of Galen was from this,
it is manifest. For whiche of his bookes is not stuffed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde

intituled <hi>de Methodo medendi,</hi> &amp; <hi>de arte curatiua ad Glauconem,</hi>
Though in dede it should seme by <hi>Cornelio Celso,</hi> that it was not

of his seuenth booke calling <hi>Chirurgia</hi> the thirde parte of

   </p>

Ex eo intelligitur quod neque chirurgia sine diaetetica, neque hac
sine chirurgia (id est sine ea parte quae medicamentorum vtilium
vsum habet) perfici possunt. Sed aliae ab alijs adiuuantur, &amp; quasi
consumantur, <hi>That is to saye.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="14"/>
It is manifest that the entermedled partes of medicine are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
together, that they can in no wise be separated, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimente
of the whole medicinall profession. Wherby it is gathered
that neither chirurgerie without the dietetike parte, nor this without
chirurgerie, (that is without that part that hath the vse of profitable
medicines) can be accomplished: But one is holpen and (as it were)
finished by the other. These wordes also doth <hi>Philiatros</hi> reporte.</p>
   <p>But why shold I reste here resiting many authorities about a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so euident? seyng that to wyse men it nedeth not, as to the folyshe
it booteth not. But let the present tyme be iudge therin, howe muche
hurt the same causeth. For the persons professing either of these partes
are so in hate with the other partes, that they thynke it a dishonor to
be acquainted one with an other: For as the sayde <hi>Philiatros</hi> sayeth,
the phisiciens or professors of the dieterike parte, abhorre chirurgerie,
as a thing to vyle for their profession. And they that are chirurgiens,
estemynge their profession to bee only one parte of physicke, and
that for the exterior partes of mannes bodie, regarde not to bee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
thynkyng that it is not nedefull to their arte. And likewyse the
pharmaceutike parte, trustyng to the learnyng of the Phisiciens and
chirurgiens, thynke it no boote to be learned them selues: In so much
that olde women must gather their herbes, vnto whome they trust for
the truthe of thynges, rather then to their owne knowledge. And the
Phisiciens hauing only learning, truste to the Chirurgiens and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
for experience: and yet in the meane season hatynge either of
both, if they medle in the dietetike parte: so that betwene trusting &amp;
hatyng one an other, they are all voyde and destitute of perfection.</p>
   <p>But it can not be gathered that Galen, nor yet Hippocrates, which
was before Galen, about .640. yeres, for Hippocrates liued. from the
tyme of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> vnto <hi>Artaxerxes Ochus,</hi> that is to
saye, 104. yeres: in the whiche season he healed kyng <hi>Perdicas</hi> of his
disease. Whiche <hi>Perdicas</hi> reigned in Macedonie eyght yeres, which
was before Galen his tyme .634. yeres. It can not I saye be founde,
that any of these two moste excellent men dyd in their tyme thus vse
phisicke, for it may be proued (as it is before playne enough) that they
playde the Apothecaries, and as wel made, as deuised their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ines,
and also vsed in their owne persons chirurgeris or the handye
worke of phisicke. For otherwyse they could not haue wryten suche
perfect bookes therof? neither would they haue taken suche peyne in
any arte, wherin they had not muche delyted: or the same greatlye
estemed.</p>
   <p>But our pernicious deuision hath as I lately sayde, brought all to
confusion: so that neither parte is nowe vsed only of the experte pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
therof, but rather of euery smearer, that listeth to abuse them.
For as the phisiciens thynke their learnyng sufficient, without prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
or experience: so the chirurgien for the moste parte hauyng expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb facs="14"/>
and practise, thinketh it vnnedefull to haue any learnyng at all,
which also hath bold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ed euery ignorant, rusticall, ye and foolyshe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to think them selues sufficient to professe and worke, in so noble
and worthy an arte.</p>
   <p>We fynde also by the testimonie of Galen in <hi>lib. xiiii. de methodo

and cicatrizatiues: as also in restoring of dislocations, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures:
that is to saye, displaced ioynetes or broken bones. To take
away superfluous thinges, is to mundifie vncleane sores, from theyr
fylthy eschares or cores, superfluous and rotten fleshe, corrupted bones
sliuers, arowheades, pellets, or any other vnnatural thinge: And also,
separatyng from the body, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

be legges, feete, toes, armes, handes, fingers, wennes, wartes, or any
other vnprofytable, eminēces, that either payne, anoy, or disfygure the
bodye. Of these also hath euery vndiscrete personage snached a piece,
in suche wyse, that they runne about and throughe the contrey, and
eche coaste of the same, like pedlers, tynkers, ratte katchers, and very
vacabundes, some onely to set bones, some to drawe tethe, some to let
blood, some to cutte ruptures, and take out stones: but all thys, rather
(vnder suche colour) to maynteyne an Idle and theuyshe lyfe, then to
profyte the common weale, to the great vprobrie of all the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of medicine.</p>
   <p>If (as the learned interprete) this word <hi>chirurgia,</hi> doth signifye
a medicinall operation or working with the hand, which is to be done
vpon the most excellent of lyuyng creatures, man his body, yea in hys

shalbe suffred (be they neuer so vnmete) to occupy so excellent an
art, playing as it were the marchant venterers, not for gain or losse of
goodes and ryches, but for lyfe and death, vpon the body of man.</p>
   <p>If as (Guido saith) the fyrst point of a Chirurgien is to be lerned:
how hapneth it then, that euery ignorant &amp; vnlerned asse, yea very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to all lerning and knowledge, be suffred to worke, yea and proue

in theyr own conceipte, may worke and practise what they wyl,
and that without interruption or punyshment for their abusion, vpon
the body of man?</p>
   <p>If as (Haly affirmeth) a chirurgien ought to be a man of good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion,
and no foole nor vnwyttie, nor of rude vnderstanding: but of

   <p>What auayleth the goodly orders, taken by our forefathers and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

that are miscreate or deformed of body:<note place="margin">Properties of a Chirurgien</note> as goggle or skwynte eyed,

that are men of science indede,) preferred to lyuinges for that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
contrary to the ordinances and lawes of a citie, beyng a carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a cobler, or a corier of lether, or whatsoeuer he be: The wyttye,
the learned, the man of knowledge, the citizen, and the free man, in the
meane season wantyng preferrement and lyuyng?</p>
   <p>Well, I besech god that there may be some occasion geuē, to procure
a redresse, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> none may worke without knowledge ioyned to experiēce:
whiche no doubte were the waye to haue perfect men in this arte:
<pb facs="15"/>
where as nowe it is not lyke that euer there shalbe many. For who
wyll set his sonne to schole with coste and great charge, and then put
hym to suche an arte wherin is neyther gayne nor hope of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And is not this a wondrous case, that the arte of medicine is
so free for all men to vse that wyll: That the very rustians, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
barators doe vse the same as a common shifte, wherby to obteine
their wycked purposes with the lesse suspicion? Under whiche co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
they also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ary in townes and cities, hauyng their filthy company
resortyng vnto them, without danger of the lawes: so that this noble
arte is become (for lack of order) a couert vnto all filthynes and vyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
as well thefte and murder, as also moste fylthy whordome. To all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wycked persons also, whiche despysing all lawes and order, doe
vnder the pretence of this professiō, flete &amp; flee from towne to towne,
from shere to shere. Through the whiche there are suche filthy vyces
mainteined, and enormities suffered, as no honest eare would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here it: And therfore I blushe to remember it, and shame to write
it. Whiche euels coulde neuer haue been done vnder that couerte, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
none but the learned and experte myght haue wrought, and they also
admitted by the byshop: as it hath in tymes paste been holsom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>lye or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
in this Realme. Which lawe, if euery byshop would witsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
to execute in his dioces: there shold (I beleue) be a greater quietnes
in the common weale then there is.</p>
   <p>But if by this li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tle any man might be stirred with zele, to procure a
redresse in these thynges, truly I should recken my selfe amonge the
number of them that are happy. Alas there are goodly orders taken,
and profitable lawes made, for makyng of clothe, tannyng of leather.
makyng of shoes &amp; many other externall thynges: The abuse wherof
is but a dearth or disprofite of the purse: and shall there not be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
had for the true vse of a science, whervpon dependeth the health
of mans body? without whiche, what is mans lyfe but a very misery
or wretched werines? The abuse of whiche science is not only a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profite
to the purse, but of a farre greater charge: That is to saye, the
losse of helth and lyfe.</p>
   <p>I wyshe therfore, in gods behalfe, that a staye maye be had in these
thinges, as wel as in other, &amp; yet not except man his lyfe &amp; helth excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth
all other earthly cōmodities: And as man his life excedeth in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
all other possessions of this worlde: that there might likewyse be
the more care and diligence for the preseruation therof, then for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thyng. For although chirurgiens from henceforth, teache their
science to none but to suche as be learned: yet if all that will may vse
it without exception, though they were neuer traded vp in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse
of the same, there shall remayne styll a great disorder.</p>
   <p>I am not ignorant, that some men will thinke, that this booke (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
publyshed) wyll be an occasion for suche men to be the bolder to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
the same science. But I knowe and am sure, that they shall not
learne in this booke any thyng wherwith to hurte: neither haue I
<pb facs="16"/>
publyshed the same for them. And farther if any abuser of chirurgery
reade this boke, he shall (I trust) so fynd himselfe rubbed on the galle,
that he shall be moued (if he haue any shame) to leaue his vice, rather
then more to vse it. But what neded we to doubt to set worth all scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in englyshe, yf by the lawes (as is aforesayd) none myght vse the
same, but suche as (beyng expert) are fyrst approued, and then lauful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admitted?</p>
   <p>Let all yong men therfore, that professe or intende to learne this
worthy art, first learne perfectly their anatomy, then the natures and
complexions of their pacientes, and then the propreties of their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines:
whych they shall neuer doo, vnlesse they study consequentely to
know the vertues and temperamentes of symples: as herbes, seedes,
rootes, gummes, trees, fruictes, veynes of the earth, stones, mettals,
beastes, fyshes, and fowles: of whiche are made the medicines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Chirurgien muste worke. This is the true way to be a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect
chirurgien, and otherwyse not to be atteined, as Lanfranke hym
selfe the author of this boke, (as thou shalt rede) affirmeth: who flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
.268. yeres paste, in the time of Edward the fyrst king of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
and Philyp the fayre reigned then in France.</p>
   <p>I wyshe therfore, that this boke and suche lyke, should be red of al
estates, that they may vnderstand how this laudable science is buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon reason, and how farre from the trade of true science, these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horfull
abusers be: whiche take vpon them to worke in Chirurgery,
by thee onely readyng of a booke or bokes, not beyng traded vp in the
true practise and experience therof. For as good doctor Record in the
Preface to his vrinall of Phisyke saith, what is learnyng vnlerned?
or knowledge vnknowen? any thyng els but a vayn name? learnyng
then increaseth moste (sayth he) when it is studied of moste: and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
then triumpheth moste, when it hath moste fauourers and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers:
and then dothe ignorance (learnings enemy) reioyce most, when
learnyng reygneth in fewest, and blyndnes ruleth most: so that then is
lernyng most profaned, contemned and hated, when she hath most ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies:
That is to say, when most men are ignorant. For that old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
shall always be true, learning hath none enemy but the ignorant.</p>
   <p>O that this worthy sentence were so wayed and folowed, that
the Chirurgiens should not worke vpon any parte of man his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
vnlesse they can by reason proue and certifie their pacientes, that
suche kynde of workyng is behouefull for their health. For he that
hath none other reason, but thus haue I done, or this or thus haue I
sene my maister worke, is not worthy to worke vpō the body of mā.
But if it were come to this isue, that all men so knewe the reason of
this arte, that they woulde suffer none to minister to their diseases,
but such as could proue their worke to be good, by reason and true or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of science, these hateful abusers could no longer haue place.</p>
   <p>This notable briefe worke of Lanfranke may satisfie those curious
katchers, that finde fault with Vigo, for his great cōpositonis (which
they call superfluous) and ample doctrine (whiche they terme te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes.)
For here haue they a briefe doctrine of ryght good effect,
<pb facs="16"/>
and small compositions of sufficiēt vertues. Which he wrot vnto his
frend, as an introductiō to a greater worke: and that performed he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
in effect, in the yere of Christ .1296. Whiche also may be an
ensample to all maisters vnto their disciples, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in these dayes vse this
arte, specially to suche as rather hyde their science from their seruātes
(because perhaps their owne store is not great) then teache them tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
There be to fewe examples of englysh chirurgiens that haue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bookes to instructe their disciples: Though these daies (gods holy
name be glorified therfore) may therof lesse cōplayne then many yeres
past. I must nedes therfore coūsel all yonge mē (since now they haue
so good helpes) to be diligent to learne, and not to spare the very stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of cunning: that is to saye that they will be so vigilant as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
it, although it be hydden from them.</p>
   <p>For truly there are many, that take seruantes and apprentises, not
for to teache them science, but only to be their drudge, and to doe their
toyle and labore: whiche is the cause, that so many come out of their
yeares so ignorant. For their intent is to haue seruantes to dooe
the toyle in their house, and not to make them cunnyng men: yea and
some will refuse a yonge man that is learned, and apte to vnderstande
to haue an ignorāt slaue, to beare the water tankard, &amp; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And yet will suche a one bragge and boaste, at seuen yeres ende, as
though he had all the learnyng and cunnyng vnder the sonne, although
in very dede, the most knowledge that he hath is, to poule, or sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

drawe a toothe, or dresse a broken pate. Alas is not this a great pytye,
that suche a noble arte shall thus be abused euery way, through the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
lucre &amp; auaricious myndes of men? Is it not a shame to vse such
roberie? doe ye not steale lyke robers the seruice of your apprentyses,
when cōtrary to your couenantes, ye hyde your science from your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes,
to whom ye are bound: to teache it? and yet (in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
receiue the labor of their bodyes, more lyke slanes then men?
beside the great dishonor that therby you doe to your own profession,
God graunt that I may see this amended, as I trust I shall.</p>
   <p>In the meane season my counsell shall be, that all yonge men b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

seruantes spare to take no kynde of payne, so that science may be that

But one thyng yet I must warne all yong men of, that will profite
in suche studie as I haue instructed, which is in one pointe to refrain
and discente from the most part of yong men: that is to saye, from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and spendyng the time in playe: for in my fantasy, who so euer is
adicte to play &amp; games shall neuer profite in this arte. For thou shalt
fynde it time litle enough for thy study, if thou occupie all thy leysour
from thy maisters or thyne owne busines at thy booke, that as thou
workest or seest thy maister work: so thou maist therwith vnderstand
the reason how, and howe muche suche worke is profytable.</p>
   <p>And hereof assure thy selfe, that if thou haue not as great desyre to
thy boke, as the greatest gamner hath to his game, thou shalte neuer
worthily be called cunnyng in this art. For thou must thynke and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme
all tyme of leysure from thy worke and busynes, euen loste and
euyl bestowed, in which thou hast not profyted somwhat at thy boke.
Let thy boke therfore, I say, be thy pastyme and game which (if thou
loue it as thou oughtest) will so delight thee, that thou shalt thinke no
tyme so well bestowed as at it. Yea thou muste desyre it as the childe
doeth his mothers pappe: and so will it nourishe thee, that thou shalt
worthily growe and increace to a worshypfull fame of cunnynge and
learnyng.</p>
   <p>And nowe whatsoeuer vnto this work is added by me, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positiue
Table, and the natomie: I most hartyly desyre al the good
Readers to interprete it to the beste, regardyng the good wyll of the
worker, rather then thexcellency of the woorke, whiche I confesse to
be very faynt: trustyng that all suche as in those thynges are my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and betters, wil rather seke the redresse and amēdement of such
thynges as to them shall seme faultie, then disdaynfully to reprehende
my good wyll, in settyng foorth of this worke. But as I feare it not
in any godly or charitable personage: so am I past care, what be said
of suche disdayners as speake euel of the doynges of all men, and yet
wyll do nothyng that good is them selues. Not consydering that a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
creature is not borne into this worlde, onely to profite himself,
but much rather to gratifie his frendes and contrey (as Cicero saith)
besides Christian charitie, whiche byndeth vs to profyte all men.
And our sauiour Christ warneth vs, that no man hyde his
talent. Thus (wyshyng to the gentyll readers theyr
hartes desyre, that trauayle for the perfectnesse
of this art, euen as vnto my self in my
moste weighty affayres:) I ende
this my symple
