      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER, This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Robe, so richly wouen with the prayses onely of Sir ROBERT SHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY (thy Conntriman) comes to thee at a lowe price, though it cost him deere that weares it, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase so much fame, as hath made it so excellent. It is now his, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Thine so long as it is his; for euery good man (as I hope thou art) doth participate in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of those that are good, and vertuous.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>He hath bene a traueller a long time, giue him now a welcome home; the Armes of his owne Country embracing him, will bee more ioyfull to him, then all those of so many forraine Kingdomes, with which he hath so often beene honoured.</p>
   <p>If a man that hath ventured through the world, may deserue thy loue, thou canst not chose, but bestow as much of it vpon him, as vpon any. Looke vpon him true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thou shalt find a large gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chronicle of time writ in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Volume.</p>
   <p>Hee comes laden with the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyes of Warre, and the honors of Peace. The <hi>Turke</hi> hath felt the sharpnesse of his sword, and against
<pb facs="4"/>
the <hi>Turke</hi> is hee now whetting the swords of Christian PRINCES. Much more could I speake of him, but that I should doe wrong to the common Lawes of ciuilitie, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away that Reuerence from Strangers, whome (from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes afarre off) you shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently heare giuing ample testimonies of his Noblenesse.</p>
