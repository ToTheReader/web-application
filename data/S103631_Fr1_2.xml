      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen, about a year agoe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to tender to your Royall hands some few short Propositions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Church-Government, I little thought, that either the publike, or my own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oecesan Occasions would have called on me for so large and speedy a pursuance
<pb facs="3"/> of them, as now I am invited unto. Episcopacie since that time hath suffered in the north, even to the height of patience; and I have met with some affronts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my owne Iurisdiction: All evils (especially those of Schism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ing, and doe much mischiefe, both in their act, and the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; It was therefore time for me to bend my best indeavours both to the remedy of what had happened in mine owne Dioecesse, and prevention of what fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mischiefe might ensue. And long I sate downe, and waited for the undertaking of some abler pen; but seeing such a silence in so needfull a subject, as one that might not be too long wanting either to the vindication of the common cause, or the safety of my owne charge, I have thus boldly rushed forth into the Presse.</p>
   <p>I cannot be so weakly inconsiderate, as to think that I could put my finger into this fire, and not be scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I doe well know, never any man toucht upon this quarrell, who was not branded with the deepest cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; Yet I do willingly sacrifice my self herein to God and his Truth.</p>
   <p>I confesse my heart burnes within mee to see a righteous cause thus martyred through unjust preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to see some honest and well-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians misled into a palpable error under the pretence
<pb facs="3"/> of zeale and piety, by the meere names of two or three late Authors, not more learned and godly, than (in this point) grossely mistaken.</p>
   <p>If your Majesties great Cares of State could part with so much leisure as to peruse this short, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relation of the first ground, and originall of this unhappie division in the Church, it might please your Majestie to be informed, that when <hi>Petrus Balma,</hi> the last Bishop of <hi>Geneva</hi> was by his mutining Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens frighted, and driven out of his place, and that Church was now left headlesse: <hi>Farell,</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> two zealous Preachers there, devised, and set up a new platforme of Church-Government never before heard of in the Christian World; Themselves would supply the Bishop; and certaine Burgesses of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should supply his assistant Clergie; and both these together would make up the body of an Ecclesiasticall Senate or Consistorie. This strange bird thus hatched by <hi>Farell,</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> was afterwards brooded by two more famous successours; and all this within the compasse of our present age. Now, had this forme (being at first devised only out of need for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent shift) contained it selfe within the compasse of the bankes of the Lemane lake, it might have beene there retained, with either the connivence, or pitie of the rest of the Christian world: but now finding
<pb facs="4"/> it selfe to grow in some places, through the fame of the abettors, into request, and good successe; it hath taken the boldnesse to put it selfe forth to the notice and approbation of some neighbour Churches; and some there are (which I blesse my selfe to see) that have taken such liking to it, that they have affected a voluntary conformity thereunto: and being weary of that old form of Administration, which hath (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction) continued in the whole Christian Church from the times of the blessed Apostles of Christ inclusively untill this present age, are not onely eager (out of their credulity) to erect this new frame, but dare venditate it to the world, after fifteene hundred yeares deep silence, for the very Ordinance, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ; whereas, if any living man can shew any one lay Presbyter, that ever was in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, till <hi>Farell</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> first created him, let me forfeit my reputation to shame, and my life to justice. This is the true ground of this wofull quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; wherein I cannot but heartily pitie the misgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of many well-meaning soules, of your Majesties subjects, which are impetuously carried away in the throng, by the meere sway of names, and tyrannie of an ignorant zeale; not being so much as suffered to know where they are, or on what ground they goe: the fervent desire of whose reclamation, as of the
<pb facs="4"/> settlement of others, whom the ill condition of the time might cause to stagger, hath put my pen upon this envious, but necessarie taske; whereto also my zeale was the more stirred, by an information, which I received from the late meeting at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> In the eight Session whereof it is reported, that one <hi>M. G. Grahame</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi> had openly, before the whole body of the Assembly, renounced his Episcopall Function, and craved pardon for having accepted it, as if thereby he had committed some hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence; this uncouth act of his was more than enough to inflame any dutifull son of the Church, and to occasion this my ensuing (most just) expostulation. Only I had need to crave pardon of your Majestie for the boldnesse of this interpellation, that I have dared to move your Majestie to descend so low, as to take view of this (on my part, so confidently undertaken) duell; Although, if the Combatants be single, yet the Cause is so common, as that the whole Church of God claimes her interest in it; But your Majesties long-knowne goodnesse incourages me to this presumption; And withall, I could not but have some due regard to that right, and propriety, which your Majestie may justly challenge in all the labours of this kinde, from whose pen soever, as being under God appointed the great Patron of all divine truths, the great Guardian
<pb facs="5"/> and Protector of these parts of his Church upon earth, whose true, ancient, and Apostolicall government is here questioned, and whose deserved devotions, and faithfull prayers shal be continually powred out to the God of heaven, for your Majesties long and happy preservation, amongst which shall be duly paid the daily tribute of</p>
