   <head>THE PREFA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CE TO THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ADER.</head>
   <p>THe kingdom of heauen is compared in holy scripture
(christen Reader) to a marchant aduenturer, whiche
seking and trauailing to finde precious stones,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> hauing
at length founde out one of singular and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lēt
value, goeth and selleth al that he hath to bye that one. What
this singular and most excellent perle is, whereunto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen is compared, if we weigh and ponder diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we shall finde it to be no other thing, then the <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
Iesus,</hi> whereby the kingdom of heauen is vndoubtedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.
This perle is of price so singular, and of value so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
that to gett it we sell al that we haue, we renounce the
worlde, the fleshe and the diuell with all the pompe thereoff,
we cleaue onely to this, we professe to lyue and dye in it.
This precious pearle off <hi>Fayth,</hi> this singular iewell of true
belefe, this heauenly treasure off the right knoweleadge
off God and off his commaundements, as all nations att
one tyme receyued nott,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> God off hys secrett and right iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
sufferring the Nations to walke on their waies, but in
seuerall ages, and by seuerall meanes, as and when it pleased
God was opened and made manifest, so haue al nations not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that, solde all which they had, yelding and submitting
them selues only and wholly thereto, but also haue stedfastly
and assuredly cleaued vnto it, haue by longe succession preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it, and enioyed it. If any haue in time vtterly lost this most
excellent and rare iewell (as we see, alas, all the Southe and all
most all the East part of the worlde hath) the cause thereof
hath ben the alteration, and new deuised furbishing of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
from the former and natural shape thereof, first and formest
receiued. Such nations and partes of the worlde as haue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="14"/>
ages and, do yet kepe and enioy this riche and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treasure, do therefore yet kepe it and enioye it bicause they
continew and remaine in it after such order and maner only,
as they receiued it: bicause they kepe it as they founde it, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
they continue it, as they begonne it. Of the first if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
the breaking in of the Wandals in to Afrike about the
yeare of our Lorde 400. men soone after infected with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
haeresy, if we call to minde the great rage and tumult of
heresies, in the Greke Churche, Arrians, Macedonians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,
Monothelites, and a numbre of such other, if we
will truste the reporte and course of Hystories thereof, we shall
euidently see, that this inestimable iewell off the Christen
faithe hath in Afrike and Grece vtterlye ben loste, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
they departed from the first paterne deliuered vnto them,
bicause they altered the faith first receiued amonge them,
brefely bicause they yelded to heresies. Of the later if we haue
an eye to the vniformite of the Christē faith first receiued in al
such countres as yet remaine Christians, with the faith first
planted and graffed amonge them, if we looke to Italy, to Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce,
to Spaine, to the catholike territories of Grece, of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of Suicerland, to the kingdomes of Poole, of Portugall, and
of other maine landes in other places off the worlde dispersed,
where the precious iewell of this faith is knowen and enioyed,
we shall finde that all those countres haue and do therefore yet
continew in the same, bicause they varie not from the first
faith receiued, bicause they mangle not the iewell geuen vnto
them, neither alter the naturall shape thereof, brefely bicause
they beleue al one thinge and after one sorte as their first tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Apostles beleued and taught them. For why? They
haue well remēbred the admonitions of S. Paule to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
conuerted by him to the faith of Christ, when he wrote
vnto them and saied, <hi>Vigilate &amp; state in fide.</hi> Wathch and stande
in the faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.</note> Also to Timothe by him in like maner christened,
<pb facs="14"/>
writing vnto him and saying. <hi>O Timothee depositum custodi, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
prophanas vocum nouitates.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> O Timothe keape wel that is
committed to thy charge, auoiding prophane nouelties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
And again to the Colossians, praising them for the faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<hi>if yet</hi> (saieth he) <hi>ye continew stedfast and grounded in the
faith, if we wauer not from the hope of the gospel, which ye haue heard,
which hath ben preached in all the worlde.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Colos. 1.</note> Al Christened Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
countrees haue wel remembred these lessons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
And as many as haue remembred and folowed them, haue
remained and do yet remaine in the faith of Christ, haue long
enioyned and do yet enioye this rare and inestimable iewell
compared to the kingdom of heauen. As al other countres haue
so done, so haue we englishmen also these many hundred yeres
kept and preserued sound and whole the precious perle of right
faith and belefe, as longe as we remained stedfast in the faith
first plāted and graffed amōg vs, as long as we kept that which
was committed vnto vs, as longe as we wauered not from the
gospell first receaued and vniuersally preached through all the
worlde, as S. Paule willeth vs. But after we beganne to alter and
poolish after our owne newe deuises this auncient perle so lōg
kept amonge vs, so vniuersally made of and estemed, after we
forsooke the first paterne off the Christen faith deliuered vnto
vs, we haue fallen in to plenty of heresies, from one heresy to
an other, from Lutherā to sacramentary, and so forth, we stande
also in daunger to fall (as other countres haue done before vs)
from a false faith to no faith, from heresy to paganisme.</p>
   <p>The which lamentable and dreadfull state to the entent we
may by the example of other countres, and by the aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Apostle beware and eschew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

Reader) of this precious iewell of our faith in Christ, what
<pb facs="15"/>
and of what maner it was, when wefirst receiued it, how and
when we came by it, what force and authorite it ought to
beare with vs, and last of all how farre and wide it varieth
frō the pretended false faith of these wicked daies. As touching
the former pointes, what the faith first planted among vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisshmē
was, how and when we receiued it, bicause it is a matter
historicall, in an History'ye shall reade it. As concerning the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pointes, of what authorite the faith then planted ought to
be, and how notoriously the false faith of this time pretended,
differeth from the same, bicause it is a matter of doctrine, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be tried by lerning, in a treatise by itselfe as farre as our
abilite serueth, it shall be proued and tried. The history which
must reporte the faith first planted amongevs, shal be no story
of our owne deuising, no late compiled matter, where bothe for
vncertainte of thinges so longe paste, we might be much to
seke, and for the case of controuersies now moued, partialite
might iustly be suspected, but it shal be an history writen in the
fresh remēbraunce of our first Apostles, writen aboue 800. yeres
past, writen of a right lerned and holy Father of Christes chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
of a countreman of oures liuing and flourishing shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the faith so planted amonge vs. Of the Author of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
and of the matter thereof we shall presently speake, if we
first admonish thee, gentle Reader, that touching the treatise
to fortifie this faith, and therefore called, <hi>A Fortresse of the faith
first planted among vs englishmen &amp;c,</hi> and cōcerning al that therin
shall be treated, you take the paines to readethe Introductiō or
first chapter therof. In it you shal see what the whole cōtaineth,
what is of you to be looked for and of me to be perfourmed.</p>
   <p>Touching the Author of this History, he was a countremā
of oures borne in the Northe countre, by Weimouth not farre
frō Dyrrhā.<note place="margin">Of the Author of this History.</note> He flourished in the yere 730. He was a mā of great
lerning and vertu, much reuerēced not only at home, but also
through out al Christendō euē in his life, time and much more
<pb n="1" facs="15"/>
after his death. Of his rare lerning and knowleadg his writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
yett extant,<note place="margin">Of his lerning.</note> are a clere and sufficient testimony. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
of Basill haue of late yeares sett forthe his whole
workes now extant, in eight tomes contayning four great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.
In them it appeareth that S. Bede was a man vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
sene in all good lerning, as well of humanite and philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
as of diuinite, expert off the tounges, ready in holy
scriptures, perfectly conuersant in the olde fathers. He was so
great a folower of S. Augustin, the worthyest piller of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
sence the Apostles time, that his commentaries vpon holy
Scriptures bothe of the olde and newe Testament, are allmost
worde for worde out of S. Augustin. He was so diligent a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that lerned Father, that whereas in the wordes of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
no perpetuall commentary vpon the epistles of S. Paule
being extant, and yet that worthy Fathers in diuers places of
his lerned workes hauing by occasion touched and expounded
euery text of those epistles, <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> for the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his posterite, as a man borne to edifie Christes Church,
hath so gathered those scattered places out of the mayne sea off
S. Augustins workes, that placing them in order and facion, he
made a iust and full commentary vpon all the epistles of S. Paul
with S. Augustins owne wordes, noting to the reader allwaies
the booke and chapter of S. Augustin, from whence he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
those places. This worke is intituled <hi>Collectanea Bedae.</hi> In
which worthy worke, we may doubte whom to maruaile more
at or commend. S. Augustin which had so ofte in his workes
treated of S. Paul, and omitted no one sentēce vnexpounded, or
S. Bede which so gathered into a iust commentary the sayinges
of S. Augustin, meaning no such thinge. As S. Bede was a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
writer, so he was a continuall preacher. His homelies yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
do testifie, made not only vpon the ghospells and epistles
of the Sondaies through out the yeare but also vpon the festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
daies of Saintes. They are to be read in the seuenth tome
<pb facs="16"/>
of his workes. These homilies of his were so highly estemed
that (as Trithemius reporteth) they were openly read in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Lib. de scri. ecclesiasti.</note>
while he yet lyued, through out our countre. Euen as we
reade of holy Ephrem that lerned deacon of Edessa, that his
writinges also were openly read in churches,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Cata. vir. illust.</note> next after holy
scripture. After his death they were receiued of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Christendom, Fraunce especially (as Platin noteth)
and are to this daye read in principall festes with no lesse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite
and reuerence then the homilies of S. Ambrose,<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note> S.
Augustin, S. Gregory, and other. Briefely the whole occupation
and businesse of this lerned man was, to lerne, to teache and to
write, as in his owne wordes placed after the ende of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he recordeth him selfe. Againe for the more commendation
of his lerning, it is to be remēbred what lerned scholers he had.
Amonge the rest the most famous were (as Polidore specifieth)
Rabanus,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Histor.</note> Alcuinus, Claudius, and Ioannes Scotus, not the
scholeman but an other of S. Benets order. These were all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and lerned writers, as in Trithemius who hath writē their
liues the lerned may reade. Alcuinus S. Bedes scholer beinge
sent of Offa kinge of the middleenglishmen in embassage to
Charlemain the first and most glorious Emperour of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
was for his vertu and lerning retained with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and became his scholemaster and instructer in all kinde
of good lerning. He taught after at Paris, and persuaded the
Emperour Charlemain to erect there an vniuersite: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with that vertuous fountaine S. Bedes scholer and our
countre man, we see now to what a great riuer it hath multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and how many lerned men these vij. hundred yeares and
vpwarde haue from thence ben deriued. To returne to S. Bede,
he had two lerned brothers, <hi>Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Haymo</hi> bothe famous
writers and lightes of the church, as in Honorius, Trithemius,
Platin,<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note> and other ecclesiasticall writers it may be sene. And thus
much of his lerning, which who list farder to trie, he may reade
<pb n="2" facs="16"/>
his lerned workes, lately sett forth (as I saied) and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the protestants thē selues of Basill. For more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the english reader, I will after the preface place his whole
life shortly writen by Trithemius, with the enumeration of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his workes in his time knowen.</p>
   <p>As touching the vertu of holy S. Bede,<note place="margin">Of his vertu.</note> which properly cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
an historiographer, and dischargeth him from all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and suspicions of false reporting or poeticall fayning, yt
may be to any well meaning man a sufficient argument that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the age of seuen yeares (as he writeth him selfe)
he liued in cloyster and serued allmighty God day and night in
religion to the last houre of his life, which was the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce
of lxv. yeares. All which time he so attended to praier, to
daily and howrely seruing of God in the church, to priuat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, that (as one writeth) if ye consider his life, ye would
thinke he had studied nothing, and againe if ye beholde his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ye would suppose he had spent no time in praier. For his
great vertu and modesty he was in his life time called <hi>Venerable
Bede,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In vitae Bedae.</note> as Trithemius noteth, of whom also Platina in that sence
speaketh, saying.<note place="margin">In Ioan. 6.</note>
      <hi>Beda praeter graecae atque latinae linguae doctrinam
quā non mediocriter tenuit, ob religionem e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>iam atque modestiam Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilis

for his religion and modesty: beside that he was lerned
in the Graeke and Latin tounge.<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> Polydore alleaging Bede in
the history of oure countre, citeth him with these titles. <hi>Beda
homo Anglus, quo nihil castius, nihil melius, nihil verius, &amp; caet.</hi>
Bede an english man, then whom none more chaste, none off
more vertu, none of more truth, &amp;c. With like commendation
and reuerence he is alleaged of his lerned posterite in al ages. In
his life time not only at home with his owne countremen for
his vertu and learning he was in high estimation, and in greate
credit with the Nobilite of our countre, but also he was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
with other Christen princes (being but a monke by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
<pb facs="17"/>
in greate estimation and muche reuerenced. Therefore
lyke as we reade of S. Antony, S. Hierom, before his tyme,<note place="margin">Tripart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> hist. lib. 1. cap. 1. In Epist.</note> off
S. Bernard and other after him, all monkes and religious men,
that in their priuat celles they had yet a care of publike quyet,
and lyke counsellers of the whole worlde they moued princes
to their duty, so of holy S. Bede we reade the same. For thus
Platin reporteth of him.<note place="margin">In Ioanne vj. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>Cum Africa &amp; Hispania á Sarracenis
occuparetur, Beda, qui eisdem temporibus fuit, hanc calamitatem li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris
ad Principes Christiani nominis scriptis, lamentatus est: quo
bellum in hostes Dei atque hominum susciperent.</hi> When Afrike and
Spayne was taken and helde of the Sarrazens, Bede which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in that time, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mented this calamite in letters writen to
Christen Princes, to the entent that they should make warres
against the enemies of God and men. Wherein bothe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
zele and religions care of common quiet in holy S.
Bede appereth, and the authorite also whiche he hadd abrode
with other Christen princes is signified. Vnto whom also a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
before his death in familiar letters he prophecied of the great
waste of Europe and the West church, whiche soone after his
death ensued by the Sarazens. For as Afrike by their meanes
lost the faith and lacketh it yet, so Spayne off late only recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the faith againe. Thus muche off his learning and vertu.
Other especialls of his life, as where he was borne, howe he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and dyed, ye maye partly reade in his lyfe written by Thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius,
which we haue translated and placed a part after the
preface, partly in his own words folowing after thende of this
history.</p>
   <p>The Authour of this history being a man of suche lerning
and vertu, a countreman of oures, one that writeth the history
of thinges done at home, done in his lyfe time, or in few yeares
before, the memory of them being yet fresh and newe, it shall
not nede I trust to persuade the Reader in many words to geue
credit vnto him in such thinges as he reporteth. Neither may I
<pb n="3" facs="17"/>
feare to prefer his authotite before the authorite or report of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man that now liueth. For beside his lerning and vertu, it is
to be considered that he liued in a quiet time,<note place="margin">VVhy the Author of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s to be credited.</note> before these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies
which nowe so trouble Christendom, were moued.
He is an indifferent reporter. There is no suspicion of partes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
no preiudice of fauouring either side, no feare of affection
or misseiudgement to be gathered vpon him. We haue good
cause to suspect the reportes of Bale, of Fox, of Beacon and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
other, whiche are knowen to maintaine a faction and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
opinion lately spronge vp, who reporte thinges passed
many hundred yeares before their daies. No such suspicion can
be made of S. Bede, who lyued aboue eight hundred yeares pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
and reporteth the planting of Christen religion among vs
englishmen, partly by that whiche he sawe him selfe, partly by
the reporte of such who either liued at the first coming in of
Christendom to our countre them selues, or were scholers to
such<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Who also was no maintainer of any secte or faction, but
liued and died in the knowen common faith of Christendom,

taught them all such thinges as are now by protestants denied,

Their hope and charite so wrought, that our dere countre of

like spiders. Reade it with charitable simplicite, not with
suspicious curiosite, with vertuous charite, not with wicked
malice. As for example. The facte of Saint Gregory described
in the seconde booke the first chapter of this history reporting
how that holy man seing in Rome certain of our countremen
sette to be solde in the market, moued with their outwarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty,
beganne to pitie and lament their inward foule infidelite,
holy S. Bede writeth diligently as an argument of his greate
good zele and tendering of Christes religion, and construeth
it to the beste, as no honest Reader can other wyse do. But
baudy Bale according to the cleanes of his sprit and holy
ghospell, like a venimous spider being filthy and vncleane him

   <p>In this history it shal be no losse time to peruse the lerned,

      <hi>S.</hi> Gregory, as of Bonifacius, Honorius, Vitalianus, and other

faith, as for the extirping of Pelagians heresy, for the due
obseruation of Easter, which al Christendom hetherto kepeth,
and other like matters. While ye peruse this, ye may remembre
the lewde lies and slaunderous reproches of protestants daily
preaching and writing that after <hi>S.</hi> Gregory al faith was lost,
Gods honour was trode vnder foote, all right religion was
ouerturned and that by the Popes them selues. Better to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe

and more charitable to note the godly writinges of the
Popes here also comprised, then to prie out with baudy Bale
the euill liues of our superiours. Who were they as badde
as the Pharisees or worse, yett they are to be obeyed by the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement

Such as denie the author we wil not force thē to beleue him. We

I thinke I may be bold to require them that they beleue as farre
S. Bede, as they do the Actes and monuments of Fox, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

Venerable Bede with any of them in any respect either off ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
honesty or truthe. It may rather sauour of sinne or at lest
off wronge iudgement, and great partialite to beleue Bale and
discredit Bede: the one being notoriously bent to one side, the
other without al suspiciō off fauouring any side: the one a late

Saintes liues no lesse miraculous and different from the

and beseche that if they finde any thing writen, which passeth
their power, they do yet beleue it, not measuring the vertu and
power of holy men, with their owne vertu or power. For
God geueth giftes of the holy Ghoste to the godly, and more
excellent to such as excell in godlynes. And this I speake to
them which are not acquainted with the secret works of God.
For suche as haue wel serched and tried the secrets of the holy
Ghost, they knowe and feele his bountifulnes, and do wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what God among men worketh by mē, when by the
<pb n="7" facs="21"/>
mighty power of miracles he draweth the vnbeleuers to the
knowleadg of him. Truly whosoeuer will sticke to credit such
thinges as we shal report, no doubt but he will also sticke and
stagger, to beleue the miraculous workes of Moyses, of Iosue,
of Elias and of Elizeus. Yea the miraculous workes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
he will accompt for very fables. Otherwise, if he wil
beleue those other thinges to be al true, why wil he mistrust
these for false? For the same grace of god which wrought in the
other, hath also wrought in these holy men all such thinges as
they did. For this grace being continual and euer running, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
alwaies such as make them selues worthy thereof, by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
men, as by certain riuers, kepeth her mayne course, and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
most plentifully. Thus farre Theodoret.<note place="margin">An other out of S. Augustin.</note> For in dede, as

      <hi>Qui hoc ab eis comperit, retulit mihi vir grauis,
&amp; nohilis, &amp; dignissimus, credidi.</hi> One which vnderstode this
of the parties them selues, reported it vnto me, a sober man
a worshipful, and worthy of credit, I beleued him. But (saieth
<hi>S.</hi> Augustin in the wordes immediatly folowing) if I had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb facs="22"/>
that holy Monke my selfe, bicause, as they saie, he was both
very gentle to be asked, and very wise to make answer, I would
haue asked of him (touching this matter) whither he him selfe
came to that woman in his sleape, that is, his goste in the shape
of his body, as we also do dreame in our bodies, or whither he
him self being otherwise occupied, or if he sleapt, dreaming so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
other thinge, such a vision yet of him appeared to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mā
in her dreame, either by an Angel, or by som other meanes,
and that by the spirit of prophecy he foreknew all this, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
promised before to her husbande that he woulde see her.
For iff he hym selfe was present to the woman in her drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
truly that was done by miraculous grace not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the ghifte off God, not by his owne power. But iff
he being otherwise occupied, or sleaping hym selfe, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied

this Iohn would discusse and declare vnto me: that either at his
teaching I might lerne and knowe such thinges to be true and
certain, or els I might beleue without knowleadge, he teaching
yet such thinges as he knew. But if perhaps he would answere
to all these my doubtes out of holy scripture, and saie vnto me.<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note>

putans prodesse si sciat, discat non obesse si nesciat.</hi> For it is no small
profitt, if in such darke and doubtefull matters as by reason we
can not finde, yet we may clerely and euidently see that such
thinges are not by reason to be founde. And that euery one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to knowe, thinking such knowleadge might profitt him,
may lerne it is nedelesse to knowe, which he can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
knowe. Thus farre S. Augustin in that place, beleuing the
miraculous operations of holy Martyrs, and visions of holy
men, though he could not attaine to the reason of either other.
In like maner he beleueth that S. Felix the holy Confessour off
Nola,<note place="margin">Lib. eodem Cap. 16.</note> when that cyte was greuously assieged, <hi>non solis beneficio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

not only by miraculous workes and present succour, but by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
vision and common sight appeared vnto men. Such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
such miracles holy and lerned men sticke not to beleue,
<pb facs="23"/>
though the reason therof they perce not vnto. And euen so such
holy and miraculous examples as abund in this History, though
they can not perhaps sinke in to the hartes of protestāts, whose
faith is limited by reason, and builded vpon wordly witt, yet
Catholikes which haue lerned of S. Paule <hi>to subdue their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to the obedience of faith,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> and whose faith is guided by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
which beleueth all thinges,</hi> as the Apostle also teacheth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> can
easely beleue the report of so holy and lerned a man,<note place="margin">Heretikes will not beleue mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles.</note> as <hi>Venerable
Bede</hi> in all Christendom hath these many hundred yeares ben
accompted. Let protestants folowe the Arrians, which when a
blinde man was restored to sight at the toumes of S. Geruasius
and Protasius at Millain S. Ambrose then being bishop,<note place="margin">Confes. lib.</note> and S.
Augustin not yet christened being then present also, saied yet
(as S. Ambrose writeth of them) <hi>Non sunt isti martyres, nec tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere

      <note place="margin">Serm. 91.</note>
      <hi>nec aliquem liberare.</hi> These are no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
they can not torment the deuill, they can not helpe men.
And againe. <hi>Ariani dicunt. Non sunt daemonum vera tormenta,
sed ficta &amp; composita ludibria.</hi> The Arrians do saie. These are not
true torments of the deuills, but fayned and imagined illusions.
Let protestants folow their forefathers, olde cursed heretikes,
let them scoffe at the miracles done at the toume of S. Alban
that holy Martyr, and of S. Cutbert that holy Confessour. We
will with Theodoret, with S. Augustin and with S. Ambrose
beleue such vertu and miraculous power of holy Martyrs and
Confessours mentioned by <hi>Venerable Bede,</hi> as they beleued the
report of good men, before them.</p>
   <p>For the farder contentation of the Reader in this pointe,
beside all whiche hath ben saied, we shall in the history it selfe,
when straunge and vncredible miracles and visions shal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
note in the margin other lyke examples auouched by
the most approued writers of the primitiue churche. To make
an ende, if all this suffiseth not to defende this history from the
cauilles of protestants, bicause of the miracles here repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="9" facs="23"/>
then let them shewe a reason why the Actes and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of M. Fox, deserue not the lyke.<note place="margin">Protestāts pretende miracles.</note> Are there not also in
that donghell heaped a number of miserable miracles to sette
forth the glory of their stinking Martyrs? I report me to the

miracles such as they be, are to be foūd. And to speake somwhat
particularly, he that in this history will discredit such miracles
as S. Bede reporteth vpō report of one brother or sister, let him
geue a reason why he beleueth the tale of Elyzabeth Lawnson
and Symō Harlston.<note place="margin">Pag. 1677.</note> Who mistrusteth miracles reported vpon

seme incredible that the bodyes of dead men may remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted

hart off Zwinglius was found whole in the ashes,<note place="margin">Pa. 444.</note> all the rest of
the body being burned vp? If visions appearing to some, not to
al that are present seme fabulous,<note place="margin">Pag. 355.</note> let it be a fable (as in dede it is,
being thereof eye witnesse my selfe) that he telleth of Latimers
hart bloud, when he suffred in Oxford. Iff the Crosse of saint
Oswalde seme a superstitious tale, how much more fonde and
fabulous is the tale of one that suffred at Bramford,<note place="margin">Pa, 1670.</note> with a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
white crosse, appearing in his brest? Thus if we may cōpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
truth with falshood, light with darknes, true miracles with
light tales, we see as much vncredibilite, if we looke to reason,
as great vanite in respect of the matter it self, in the one as in the
other. But how farre more credit this auncient history of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Bede deserueth then the liyng libels of vpstert secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
it shal (as I haue already saied) easely appeare, if we consider
but the Authour of this history, and the time that he wrote in.
Whereof we haue spoken at large before. One thinge remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,

Wherein we desire the gentle Reader the rather to beare
with vs, considering that this translation being penned on this
side of the seas, we coulde not being out of the countre, haue
such speciall intelligence of eche shere and Countie as to that
purpose was requisit, and as we might perhaps easely hadd, yff
we had ben at home, and trauailed the countre our selues. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
as touching the sheres, principall cytes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
monasteries, by the helpe of Polidore we haue termed
them, as they are now called. Whereby the whole course of the
history shall be euery where perspicuous and euident, thoughe
some certaine small monasteries and villages remaine vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
How so euer it be, the principall intente bothe of <hi>Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

our first Christen faith, the course and proceding thereof, we
haue chosen rather to sett forth the history in some part barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

God that the perusing hereof, with the Fortresse and
