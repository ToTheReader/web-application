   <p>SAint Francis having a most feruent desire to drawe al men to God of what state or cōdition soeuer. Rested not, but hauing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for the men his first rule, called the Rule of the Freers Minors, and his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund Rule for women, called of S. Clare, hath also written the thirde Rule, called of Poenance, for retyred persons remayning in the worlde,
<pb n="9" facs="7"/>Ecclesiastic, and saecular; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and vnmaried; of both sexes: confirmed by Pope Nicolas the fowerth. In this Order verie manie holie persons haue liued, of which a great number are beatified, and some also Canonized in the holie church, as Saint Elizabeth, S. Ludovic, king of France. S. Iuo Priest, S. Elzearius, Count: through whose merites the order is verie much multiplied in al partes of the worlde. VVheras therfore great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="10" facs="8"/>of persons, of both sexes, are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into seueral communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, holding the foresayd third rule, and after the maner of spiritual and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people binding them selues with the three vowes, to witte, of obedience, Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Chastitie, the same notwithstanding hath been done by permissiō of the sea Apostolic: which hath holden it for good, and all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lawfully professed for true religious. Afterward
<pb n="11" facs="8"/>Leo the tenth Pope of that name, out of the first rule of Nicolas, aboue related, drewe the rule following and wrote it and cōfirmed it, for all the religious of the third order, of both sexes, liuing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Cloysters; in the forme ensuing, vvhich he wil of al to be observed. And wheras some people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue been and as yet are found, who wil not acknowlege for religious the professed of this third rule: it was necessarie at the end of the same rule,
<pb n="12" facs="9"/>heer set downe, to adde the Bul of the sayde Leo the tenth, Pope, out of which it is manifest that euen before his time they haue been hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for true Religious, and that he wil also that all mē do acknowledge and hold them for such, and that no man do cōtradict it, and other things he forbiddeth therein vnder paine of excommunication. He hath endued the fore sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Religious with al priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges giuen and granted to the Freers Minors.</p>
