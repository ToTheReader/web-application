   <p>O ETERNALL and euerlasting God, which hast made thy dwellings aboue the heauens, &amp; by the Scepter of thy mighte, doest rule all the powers in the world, all which should sound to thy praise, and redounde to the honour of thy glorious name: we most vile wretches, whom thou hast made of the dust of the earth, throw down our selues here before thy maiesty, as vnworthy to be made thy footestoole, submitting our selues vnto thee, and ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowledging our sinnes, we appeal to thee for mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye. VVe confesse (O Lorde) that our wickednesse is great, our misdeedes many, &amp; our sinnes innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and thou art iust, thy iudgements are ouer all the worlde, and the punishments due for our sinnes are intollerable. Forgiue them, O Lord forgiue thē, mollifie our hard hearts, and gyue vs right spirites, that we may see our sinne, and learn to tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy maiesty, &amp; fear to offend any longer. Oh be thou fauourable vnto vs, or els we are lost for euer: If thou be angry, what may make vs merry? if thou be offended, how may we be pleased? If vve haue lost thy fauour, what friendship can help vs? If thou withdraw thy grace from vs, what good shal our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do vs? If thou be not on our side, what shal we do with the help of man? If we be whole in body &amp; sick in soule, rich in substance &amp; poore in godlines: haue the worlde at will, and know not how to vse it: If we haue such liberty to do waht vve vvould, any yet so sinfull to do nothing as vve shoulde, Oh the finne of so corrupt hearts, what miserie vvill it
<pb facs="79"/>bring vs? vvhat vvoe will it vvorke vs? howe many plagues are there ordeined for so great sinnes? and vvhat a continuall paine vvill our vngodly pleasure purchase for vs? O Lorde if thou let vs liue heere a vvhile, in wealth &amp; ease, to the end vve shal liue for euer hereafter in misery &amp; wo? alasse that euer vve were born, to see such wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ul days: oh far be that frō vs (O Lorde) and continue thy mercy tovvardes vs for euer. VVe confesse that our sinnes haue wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued thy vvrath, and our vvickednesse, is great y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prouoke thy anger, and we know that thy mercies already shewed vnto vs, haue beene more then our deseruinges, vve haue alwayes felt thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection towardes vs, vvhen we haue shewed our selues vnnaturall children, and revvarded thee euill for good: Oh lord forgiue it vs, forgiue our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly behauiour, &amp; lay not our sins to our charge, but continue thy mercy tovvardes vs still. Looke fauourably vppon this Realme, blesse va vvith thy goodnesse, and defende vs from Sathan and all his ministers, ouerthrow their deuelish deuices, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvray their vngodly pollices: preserue our Queene vvhome thou hast placed ouer vs, let her rule faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in thy feare, make her dayes happy, and sende her a long life if it be thy good pleasure, and vvhen this her earthly princely state shall ceasse, giue her a heauenly kingdome where shee may reigne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, make her counsellers vvise in thy feare, to giue such councel, as may tende to thy glory: let he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles know that their honors consisteth in thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Teach magistrates to humble themselues, and seeke the aduancement of thy glory, let them know that they are not placed in office by thee, to gouern as they list, or do that which seemeth good in their
<pb facs="79"/>owne eyes, but to suppresse sinne &amp; support vertue, let them draw their swordes to cut downe vice, and imbrace godlines, as that which is onely their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, teach the ministerie, to teach the trueth vnto their flocke, and seeke the safety of thy people, and not their owne priuate gayne: let them not be such as can teach others and not them selues, that can shere the sheepe, and not feed the flocke, let not the desire of filthy lucre, make them carelesse to do their duety, but let the remembrance of thee (which wilt call them to an account) cause them to haue a care of their charge. Teach masters of housholdes, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses and Dames, children and seruauntes to serue thee, and lead their liues in thy feare, O Lord learne thē to know that to dwell vnder thy defence, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be happy, and not to obey thee, is to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and to heap vp for our selues, wrath against the day of wrath, vvhen, euery man shall be revvarded according to his vvorkes: let the power of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie (vvhich canst vvith a vvorde shake all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvers in heauen and earth) strike so deepe into our hearts, that we may set more by thy fauour, then all the fayre countenaunces of the world (which are but vaniti) let not any thing be our delight but that vvhich may please thee, &amp; let nothing make vs so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but that which doth offend thy maiesty. Also we beseech thee to looke vppon thy vvhole Churche (vvheresoeuer) with fauour beholde it, comfort the afflicted members therof, deliuer them with speed, or giue them patience to tarry thy leasure: let them not faint in that good course they haue begon that suffer for thy truch, but be thou their help in trouble and lay no more vppon them then they are able to beare. And although we at this time here at home,
<pb facs="80"/>haue not so great cause to complayne, as many of our brethren in other countries. But thou (O Lord) hast delt more fauourably vvith vs then with them, yet let vs not be proude of our estate, but giue vs heartes of humilitie, to prostrate our selues before thy maiestie: for vve know that our deseruings are not such, nor thy hande is not so shortned, but that thou canst strike vs as well as them, let not so great wickednesse lodge in our brests, that our prosperity shoulde make vs to forget thee, for although vve sleepe now in secutitie and thinke our selues out of danger, yet thou canst quickly set the nations about vs vpon our eares, and giue vs ouer to a worse mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe euen amongest our selues: thou canst soone make a whole man a sicke body, and of a liuing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a dead corps, and all our pleasures may soone be gone, the aduersitie of one howre may make vs to forget: all our sinnes haue truly deserued these and greater plagues, but that thy mercy tovvardes vs, hath beene great, vvhich I beseech thee for euer to continue. Forgiue vs our sinnes and pardon vs, for thy sonne Christs sake, quicken vs as thou art wont to do thy chosen, giue vs a taste of the ioyes of thy kingdome, that vve may knowe it is better to be a dore keeper in thy house, then to dwel in the tentes of the wicked &amp; vngodly, let not the vaine delights of this corrupt world lead vs vnto vanity nor let the alterations of this changeable time turne our harts from thee, but teach vs to knovve that thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes one and the same, &amp; dost neuer forget such as doe put their trust in thee. VVe know that thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care ouer thy children is great, that they shal not loose a haire of their head, but thou wilt knowe how <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="80"/>they come for̄ it: oh learn vs for so gret loue, to loue thee againe, and feare to offend so deare a Father: keep farre from vs the breach of thy laws, couetous mindes, lying lipes, swearing tongues, malicious hearts, vnchast and vngodly behauiour, which doth offend thee, and prouoke thine anger againsty vs: &amp; beate down our stoute stomcks, that we may stand in awe &amp; feare thy displeasure, that the plagues due for our sinnes may be turned away from vs. O Lord make vs wise in time, plāt in our harts a loue to thy iudgements, and alwaies haue im minde that thou which madest the eye must needs see, which madest the eare must needs heare, and thou which sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>chest the hearts and reins, must needs find out our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. And because of our selues we are not able to doe any thing that is good, but prone and apt to all kinde of sinne and wickednesse, we beseech thee so to assist vs with the ayde and help of thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite, that we may through the same, do those things vvhich of our selues we are not able, that it may be to thy glory and for the health of our owne soules. Oh let these our praiers pearce the heauens, and enter into thine eares, and giue vs this and all other things necessary for vs, from this time to the end of our liues, and after death a life to liue for euer, for thy deare sonnes sake, in whose name vve beg it of thee in that praier vvhich he himselfe hath taughte vs, saying. Our father. &amp;c.</p>
