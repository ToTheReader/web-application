In the handling vvhereoff, the Lord Bishops, and their appurtenances are manifestlie proved, both by divine and humane lawes, to be intruders vpon the priviledges of Christ, of the King, and of the common-vveal: and therefore vpon good evidence given, she hartelie desireth a iudgement and execution</title>

What danger the state is in by sinne vvithin us, iudgement vpon vs, and over vs, evill men among vs, and the vvrath of God against vs, is better knovvne to your honours then vvee can expresse. But vvee may be bold to say of religion, &amp; state, as Dauid said of himselfe, there is but a step betvveene them &amp; death.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.3.</note> In this agonie of death vvith teares &amp; groanes vvee cry to you right Honourable, <hi>save us, or wee perish.</hi> Let not the tall stature of the Anakims; nor the combination of the Edomites, nor the counsells of Ahitophells; nor the proude lookes &amp; bigge vvordes of Amaziahs deterre you, or deteyne you.

      <note place="margin">Prov. 28.1</note> Fenny-Bitters in their hollovve canes make a terrible noyse to the amazement of those that are not acquainted vvith their spirits; but they dare not looke valour in the face; nor hold vp their head in the assembly of the juste Vice is ever a covvard vvhere vertue is in place: Only this vve intreate your honours. that you vvould not be like Ephraim,<note place="margin">Hos. 13.13</note> of vvhom the Lord complayneth as of an
