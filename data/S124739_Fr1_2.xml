      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I Should mak choice of any other, thē of your Selfe, to present this Booke of <hi>The Practise of Christian VVorkes,</hi> vnto; I should not only not discharge my debt of singular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto You: but also seeme to commit an offence euen against the
<pb facs="4"/> Authours owne desire and intention For since in the language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he first wrote it, it was dedicated to his Aunt, the worthy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse of the famous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery of your Order, at <hi>Gandia</hi> in Spaine; it may seeme, that now, first appearing in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, it should, by a pious consequence, be due vnto you, that are Abbesse of the only English Monastery, of
<pb facs="4"/> that Holy Order at this day remayning in the world.</p>
   <p>And when withall, I consider, how far my selfe am growne indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits I haue receaued frō your selfe, and your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Family; I am out of hope to satisfy, for the present, the least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and so am forced to excuse my selfe, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this interest, vntill I may be better able to
<pb facs="5"/> discharge the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.</p>
   <p>In this little Booke is contained a methode of Meditation, &amp; much matter of singular piety and deuotion, both for practise &amp; speculation; sufficient to inflame not only your already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled Hart: but also many others, who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that the celestiall incense of Prayer may burne continually on the altar of their soule.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>I shall not need to say any thing of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, whose rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are so known to the World, as they require none of my prayses: since my pen should but blot the fayre paper of his Worth, if I should goe about to blazon them.</p>
   <p>I haue the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly commended this Treatise to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; hoping that your, &amp; the deuotions
<pb facs="6"/> of your holy family, wil giue it new force; that now translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, it may produce no lesse copious fruite, then it hath done in the originall Spanish, and other languages.</p>
   <p>Accept then (Right Reuerend &amp; Religious Mother) this poore mite in testimony of my true affection; which, I trust shall heerafter appeare in a more aboundant manner, when my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="6"/> shall find a more fortunate subiect, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to expresse, and shew my selfe</p>
