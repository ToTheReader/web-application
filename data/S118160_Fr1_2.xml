   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, let it be lawfull for
me with your leaues to trouble
you a little: It was my good
hap of late to get into my hāds
an English translated Copie of
<hi>Seig. Tasso's Hierusalem,</hi>
done (as I was informed) by a
Gentlemā of good sort &amp; qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and many waies commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnto me for a worke of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
worth, &amp; ezcellencie: wherupon, by the aduise, or rather
at the instance of some of my best friends, I determined to send
it to the Presse: Wherin if my forwardnes haue fore-ranne the
Gentlemans good liking; Yet let mee winne you to make me
happie with the sweete possession of your fauours, for whose
sakes I haue done whatsoeuer herein is done. When first I sent
it to the Printer, I did not certainely know whose worke it was,
and so rested depriued of al meanes to gaine his assent and good
liking thereunto, and yet notwithstanding the perswasions of
some that would faine haue preuailed with me: I resolued (at
the motion, no doubt of some rare excellent spirit, that knew
and foresaw this to be the readiest meanes to draw him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
some of his many most excellent labours) to goe on with
what I had begunne, euer assuring my selfe, and neuer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but that you would like of it your selues, and intertaine it
with such deere affection as it doth worthily merit: Now if
<pb facs="3"/>
it shall not in each part liuely resemble the absolute perfection
of the doer thereof, yet is hee blamelesse, and the fault as it is
mine, so I wil acknowledge it for mine: for by my haste it proues
his vntimely birth, and doubtlesse miserably wanteth of that
glorious beautie wherewith it otherwise would, and hereafter
happily may be richly honoured withal. Now wheras I thought
you should haue had all together, I must pray you to accept of
the fiue first Songes: For it hath pleased the excellent doer of
them (for certaine causes to him selfe best knowne) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a staie of the rest till the sommer. In that which is done,
I haue caused the Italian to be Printed together with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
for the delight and benefit of those Gentlemen, that loue
that most liuely language. And thereby the learned Reader
shall see to how strict a course the translator hath tyed himselfe
in the whole work, vsurping as little liberty as any whatsoeuer,
that euer wrote with any commendations. Thus (as in duetie I
ought) I haue presented vnto your views the course of my whole
proceedings herein, humbly praying you to censure of the work
with such respectfull consideration as shalbe meete, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
with patience such faults as are vnwillingly escaped in
the Printing. And so you shall doe what shall well beseeme
you, and giue him his right that will neuer wrong you.</p>
