   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome few yeares agoe, one <hi>Boraccio Fumiganto,</hi> a <hi>Burmudan,</hi> made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire unto me; and upon discourse of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> entreated mee upon all termes of love and familiarity betwixt us, that I would addresse my pen to treat of that Subject; being, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e verie truly affirmed, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>help</hi> to <hi>discourse,</hi> especially to our young <hi>English</hi> Gallants, whose first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation to their acquaintance is, <hi>Will you take a pipe of Tobacco?</hi> But my answer was no lesse roughly than roundly returned, replying, that <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> would have smoaked such sellers of smoake, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> would have pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their skin over their eares; if these smoakie <hi>Merchants,</hi> being such as this <hi>Burmudan</hi> was, had vended, or vented those commodities in their time. With
<pb n="88" facs="5"/>
this answer, my fuming <hi>Fumiganto</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med much discōtented, taxing me of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicacie, in condemning a Science (for so this <hi>Factor</hi> termed it) which was not onely hugg'd but honoured by our hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Gentrie;</hi> whose desire was rather to be matriculated in the exquisite taking of a <hi>Pipe,</hi> than in the tossing of a <hi>Pike;</hi> in a <hi>quiffe</hi> and a <hi>quaffe,</hi> than shaking of a <hi>staffe.</hi> Presently upon this affront, came in a <hi>Trinidadan</hi> with a <hi>Varinan,</hi> who desi ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> to heare what Subject it was that made us so hot, I replyed, it was <hi>Tobacco,</hi> the verie fume whereof, as it doth ever, had driven us to that distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. O insolence, or rather impudence, quoth the <hi>Trinidadan!</hi> shall a weed, the wealth of many Ilands, and the delight of the Queene of Ilands, receive that aspersion? tellme, tellme (quoth hee) thou profest <hi>Mamothrept</hi> to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humours, how should long and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>himney, is in the nose of the <hi>Gentrie,</hi> he discovered? Nay more, how should
<pb n="89" facs="5"/>
some <hi>Companies</hi> be maintained, if this soveraigne receipt to all maladies, were not countenanced? What Companies, said I? Marrie the Company of Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Sirrah Stoicke; whereof one <hi>Brachifort,</hi> who is no small <hi>Foole,</hi> hath procured a benefit, to inhance the rints of his pate by the rents of the pipe, and smoake them who made Pipes for others smoake. Is it possible, quoth I? Yes, my cringing Criticke (said the <hi>Varinan</hi>) that it is, and yet you disesteeme our qualitie. Besides, I heare, quoth hee, that one <hi>Aestivus Nepenthiacus,</hi> a grand <hi>Monopolist,</hi> and a judicious Practist in his profession, hath of late renounced his practice, wherein hee was a right hopefull beginner, to betake himselfe to the plantation of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> wherein I will not justifie his triall of experiments, being for the most part more deceiving than thriving; but sure I am hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Stoves, Limbecks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, and other artfull inventions, have prov'd him a Dogmaticall Doctor in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Whereto I answered, that indeed I had heard of his rare experiments, but how little <hi>Nepenthiacus</hi> had gained by them, might appeare by this, that as he
<pb n="90" facs="6"/>
had formerly left his Profession, so now of late he was enforced to leave his nation, to worke wonders among the wilde <hi>Irish.</hi> Where report was, hee intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine till he had reduced all those bogs and marishes to plots of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall is he to the State, though preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to himselfe. This, quoth the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidadan,</hi> may bee all easily done, if he exactly observe his geometricall ascents &amp; descents, which by his mathematicall line, which hee hath alwayes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with all facilitie may bee attained. For in that <hi>glorie</hi> of <hi>Ilands,</hi> wherein I have long time remained, works of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficultie than this have beene effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: but to insist on any of these I will not, because they would seeme incredible to the shallow and barraine apprehension of the vulgar: yet to make instance of one for all, I hold it not altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. I have seene the seeds of <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> sowne in a bed of gourds, and in a moneths space the whole bed of gourds were into leaves of <hi>Tobacco</hi> changed. Where at smiling, I have read (quoth I) all <hi>Ovids Metamorphosis,</hi> and I finde there no such transmutation. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell (answered he) those were fictions,
<pb n="91" facs="6"/>
these true and native relations: besides, you are to know that Travellers in their surveyes, assume a priviledge above the authoritie of Authors. Traversing thus our ground, as one cloyed with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I had a desire to leave them to themselves, and addresse my selfe to mine owne affaires; but <hi>Boraccio Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miganto,</hi> my familiar friend, and one who had more interest in mee than the other two, st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>pt betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ee and the doore, conjuring me upon that inviolable league of amitie so long professed &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, that I would rest satisfied by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to their entreatie; promising withall, that my travell should not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requited, if I would prosecute some thing touching the praise-worthy invention of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which they with such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie desired: But modestly, as seemed me, did I answer: that my labours, as they deserved no such courtesie, so did I ever scorne they should bee mercenarie: besides, if I should give way to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest by publishing ought concerning the singular use of that commoditie, yet might my Taske seeme uselesse, the oyle of my Lamp fruitlesse, being employed in that Subject so much pressed, so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="92" facs="7"/>
printed, and therefore needlesse. Whereat the <hi>Varinan</hi> seemed much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, vowing, that many yeares were not past since hee first set foot in this Ile, how then could it appeare that any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would doe him that favour, being no <hi>English</hi>-borne but a stranger, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the vent of his commoditie any labour? To which objection I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the <hi>English</hi> were ever cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous unto strangers, many times appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better of them, than of their owne naturall inhabitants. And whereas, he could not be induced to beleeve that any Author would addresse his pen to write in his favour: I assured him, that I had read the Titles of divers bookes treating of the use and commerce of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> as the Poem of that English <hi>Musaeus,</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Tobacco battered.</hi> Likewise, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pleasant poeticall Paradox in the praise of the P. wherein is learnedly proved, and by impregnable reasons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that <hi>Tobacco</hi> is the onely sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne experimentall cure, not onely for the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> itch, but generally for all maladies incident to mans bodie. Which discourse is with no lesse exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse prosecuted, than <hi>Rodolphus Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola's</hi>
      <pb n="93" facs="7"/>
was in his tract of the <hi>Vanitie of knowledge; Cornelius Agrippa</hi> in his discourse of the <hi>Uncertaintie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> or <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Encomion</hi> in the <hi>Praise of folly.</hi> Besides many other judicious relations of late yeares published by our <hi>English</hi> Navigators, all tending to the praise of that excellent knowledge in the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Tobacco:</hi> and those exquisite effects which in forraine countries it hath effected. So as the Herbe <hi>Moli,</hi> so highly prized and praised by <hi>Homer,</hi> could not bee more usefull to the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>Ithacus,</hi> in repelling the charmes of <hi>Circe,</hi> than this <hi>Indian</hi> weed hath beene ever by their reports powerfull to the travelling <hi>Arabs,</hi> to inure them to all extremitie. What then should Tasks of this nature be any more revived, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so generous and generall an use of it hath made it approved? so as, whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should write against it, might have more adversaries to oppose him; than he had reasons through his whole discourse to alledge for him. Yea but, replyed the <hi>Trinidadan,</hi> for all this, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne how the Emperour <hi>Eudorus</hi> hath divers times inhibited this to all
<pb n="94" facs="8"/>
his Courtiers: yea, and long since, so bitterly inveyed against the humorous and phantasticke use thereof▪ as publikely all those great Professours, who formerly did partake of nature with the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>r, broke their Tobacco-pipes, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest their distaste of what they so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently had affected, by throwing away those instruments by which their smoak was usually conveyed. All this, said I, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> no lesse than truth; yet, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

So as, being one time there (whereby you shall easily gather how ignorant these sage <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico's</hi> were in the artfull profession of the pipe) it was my fortune to consort with a joviall fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> of young <hi>Pupills,</hi> all <hi>Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
      <pb n="96" facs="9"/>
save one or two, who had received seasoning from the <hi>Pump</hi> for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities. With whom having traversed two or three pipes of rich <hi>Varina,</hi> with some bottles from <hi>Fons. Clitonius</hi> which procured <hi>Urina,</hi> just as we were canvassing a fresh pipe, in comes a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Master,</hi> Tutor (as I afterwards understood) to those lively Lads with whom I consorted; who seeing the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all in a fume, grew into a monstrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ume himselfe, so as taking up some odde pipes which lay scattered upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>I will henceforth</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent you Boyes of your piping;</hi> and with that, he threw all their pipes into the fire, intending to burne them; and so he might, but not as he meant; for his purpose was to consume them. At this conceited tale of the <hi>Varinan,</hi> after wee had a little space laughed, I replyed; that such ignorance was now from the <hi>Academicks</hi> wholly exiled: for the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>est and gravest Students well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that long studie would dull and rebate the understanding, being by no externall receipt cheered. Upon which speech, all these three <hi>Antagonists</hi> with joynt force, made towards me, reassailing
<pb n="97" facs="9"/>
me with new reasons to undertake the defence of their Trade, objecting, how by mine owne mouth they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnè me, if they could not now at last after many perswasions; prevaile with me. For (said they) you confesse the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Court, Countrey:</hi> Yea, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie of all knowledge, even the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> affect, it, and will you in a Stoicke reluctancie oppose it? Besides this, you have sundrie affectionate Allies, all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of happie employment and hopefull improvement, who since their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Tortouga</hi> have dealt in this commoditie, to their profit and succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding memorie, which may bee an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable motive to induce it. To which powerfull objections I a little relented, yet so, as I expressely told them, I would not much insist upon their conveniencies or inconveniencies of their trade, being of late time inured to dangerous sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stication, having knowne by report of an experienced <hi>Chymicke,</hi> divers oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Quick-silver</hi> extracted from one pound of <hi>Tobacco:</hi> but to discourse of the Life and Death of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> as first of his birth and education; secondly of his Planting and Propagation, I
<pb n="98" facs="10"/>
should doe my endevour: Whereto they all joyntly consented; upon which consent I addressed my pen to this ensuing Tract here presented.</p>
