   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is an Age, (gentle Reader) of much inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mens printed workes: neither is it in my conceit either vnreasonable or vnnecessary that men should giue account for their labours, especially where they make the world beleeue
<pb facs="6"/>
they doe the world a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for otherwise the world might come to bee cosened: Therefore for my selfe, thus me thinkes I heare the world say: Sir why loade you thus both mens mindes and the Booke-sellers stalles with such change and variety of bookes, all vppon one subiect, as if men were tyed to your readings? mee thinks the little Pamphlet you first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht, might haue giuen satisfaction; To this I answer: that Pamphlet was the milke of my first experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, drawne, not to nourish the world, but to giue a little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a noble Kinsman I had, from whom a very corrupt copy was stolne, and in printing without my knowledge; so that to shield both mine owne shame and the bookes, I was compeld to put it forth in that manner as it went,
<pb facs="6"/>
&amp; then, many iudicious Gentlemen in the same art found faint in the breefnes therof, saying, that the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my rules took away much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from the yong scholler, an that there was a lamenesse therein, because I had not handled the whole members of the art, but heere a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and there a toe, as I was led by mine owne fancy. Hence it came I writ the great Boohe <hi>Cauelorice,</hi> and in it omitted nothing in my knowledge appertinent to Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship: but by reason of a too greedy and hasty Booke-seller, and the distributing of the worke into the handes of many Printers, it was not onely exceeding falsly printed, but also most part of the booke of cures left out, which was such a maime to the booke, that I was many yeares stird vp by my friends to repaire that error; which I did by writing that booke intituled the <hi>Master-peece,</hi> wherein I haue set
<pb facs="7"/>
downe euery disease &amp; euery medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, so full &amp; so exactly that there is not a farrier in this kingdome, which knowes a medicine for any disease, which is true &amp; good indeed, but I wil find the substance thereof in that booke yet this book did not satisfie my friends, for they said though it was a worke right good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, yet the greatnesse of the booke and the great price thereof, depriued poore men of the benefit; and that the multiplicity of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and the cost of the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, were such as poore men stood amazed at, and found that their beasts perisht before they could compasse that should cure them: from hence onely I haue with much labour and experience found out the Contents of this booke, where with twelue medicines, not oftwele pence cost, and to bee got com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly euery where, I will cure all
<pb facs="7"/>
the diseases that are in Horses, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, and they almost 300. This booke I hope the price will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for it is determined onely for the good of the needfull, to whose vse if it proue as fortunate as it is faithfully and iustly set downe, they will haue cause to praise God and loue me.</p>
