   <p>THis which followes, though it needeth <hi>Patronage,</hi> as great as may be had; yet it is such, as may not presume to aske it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it thrusts it selfe to the End of these Labours, that it may seeme to haue the same <hi>Patron.</hi> I would haue put nothing before it, were it not necessarie you should know <hi>the Cause why</hi> the following Discourse was written; <hi>why</hi> it stayed so long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it looked vpon the Light; and <hi>why</hi> it is not able yet to goe alone, but is led abroad by this former Worke. The Cause why it was written, was this. A <hi>certaine B. (in the Iesuit's stile)</hi> was called and required to a <note n="a" place="margin">May 24. 1622.</note>
      <hi>Conference</hi> by <hi>Them</hi> that might command <hi>him.</hi> The <hi>Iesuit</hi> with whom hee had to deale, was M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Fisher.</hi> Hee began with great Protestations of seeking the <hi>Truth onely,</hi> and <hi>for it selfe.</hi> I would the B. could haue found it so. After the <hi>Conference</hi> ended (a great part of which time he spent, in reading a passage out of a Booke which himselfe had printed) the B. not suspecting any such thing, hee spread abroad <hi>Papers of the Conference,</hi> which were full of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialicie to his Cause, and more full of Calumnie against the B. Hereupon the B. deliuered me the Papers that were spread, and a Note what was mis-spread in them, to the vttermost of his Memorie, and other helpes. And I not departing from that, haue here entirely deliuered it to the vse of the <hi>Church.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There was a Cause also <hi>why</hi> it stayed so long, before it could endure to be pressed, and you must know that too. It was not my idlenesse, nor my vnwillingnesse, to right both the B. and his Cause against the <hi>Paper</hi> that was scattered: For I haue <hi>most Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Witnesses,</hi> that this Thing (such as it is) was finished long
<pb facs="317"/>
since: for the <hi>Papers</hi> came to my hand after <hi>Michaelmasse 1622.</hi> and J finished this <hi>Relation</hi> to them that <hi>Tearme.</hi> But the cause was partly mine owne <hi>backwardnesse</hi> to deale with these men: For they pretend onely for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Vnitie,</hi> but will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> neither, vnlesse <hi>they</hi> and <hi>their Faction</hi> may preuaile in all. Whereas it is a thing impossible, <hi>so many deuout and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men,</hi> in diuers <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> should still <hi>pray,</hi> and sometimes <hi>call for a Reformation,</hi> if the <hi>Church</hi> had not warped at all, or if <hi>no</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">And the Rom. Court, the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleader in all this. For in <hi>Iul. 3.</hi> time, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

Fisher, Two,</hi> at which the worthie <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>fore-going Discourse</hi> was present. <hi>This</hi> was the <hi>Third,</hi> and therefore could not well and conueniently come into the world, till the <hi>two former</hi> (vpon which it somewhat depended) had shewed themselues.</p>
   <p>And the Cause why it cannot yet <hi>goe alone,</hi> but is led into publicke by this former Worke, is, because before those <hi>Nine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> there goeth a <hi>Preface,</hi> which together with some of the <hi>Articles</hi> themselues are the mayne and substance of all that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Two</hi> former <hi>Conferences;</hi> and so they are fittest to take this <hi>Third</hi> by the hand, and lead it forth.</p>
   <p>J haue thus farre acquainted you with the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the ensuing discourse. J haue beene a faithfull <hi>Relator</hi> of all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the <hi>B,</hi> protests hee hath beene faithfull in <hi>relating</hi> to <hi>me.</hi> But J cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
