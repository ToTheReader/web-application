      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ike as the soule surmounteth the body, in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall dignity; so doe the diseases of the soule exceed the diseases of the body, in all impiety. And consequently, greater consideratiō ought to be had in providing remedies for the soule, then for the body. Neverthelesse so it is, that none will or can in deed provide a remedy for that sore, whereof he hath no feeling or intelligence at all. In regard whereof, especially because papistry is of papistes repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no disease or sore; I haue imployed that small talent, which God of his meere mercy hath bestowed on me, to the end that all papistes who shall seriously peruse this my briefe discourse; may with all facilitie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such to be grievous diseases of the soule, as heretofore they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be none. But as they that are ignorant of their disease, neither doe nor can provide a soveraigne remedie for the same: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither can they at any time be perfectly cured, who though they knowe both the disease and the medicine for the same, yet will they not apply that medecine vnto their sore. Euen so in the subiect matter: that papist who will not once read this short volume, which unfoldeth the abomination and manifold deformities of popery: and that by most lively and euident demonstration, deduced out of the bowels of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe: must perforce still remaine in the agonie of his said disease. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if any papist shall read it, but with a resolved mind to contradict it, and so either rashly to contemne it, or without iust triall to discredit it: Such a papist (as many I feare will be found by sinister perswasion of seditious seminaries,) can not for want of due application, attaine the expected effect otherwise correspondent thereunto. And that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued papist whosoeuer thou art, maist with more alacrity read this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke; I do assure thee, that my proceeding in the discovery of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb facs="7"/>
superstitions, vanities, enormities, falshoods, dissentions, errours, heresies, and blasphemies, is such and so sincere; as upon a <hi>salvo conducto</hi> (as they tearm it) granted from any king christian, and license procured of my gracious dread soveraigne; I am and will be most willing, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire into any province in Christendom; there to give an account, and to make triall of the same. Let therefore no popish censurers, commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or excommunications, terrifie thee from beholding the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wounds of thy soule. Let no sinister perswasions, of such as are wedded to their own imaginations, disswade thee from the reading of this discourse. Let no wilfull conceit so take place in thine heart, as thou wilt rashly condemne it, before thou make due triall therof. Call to mind for Iesus Christ his sake, and for the salvation of thine owne soule; that thou art not this day more zealously affected to Popery, then I my selfe was of late yeres. Adde hereunto for Gods loue, that the perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of poperie, which I haue attained by Gods grace and painfull studie; hath so lively set before mine eyes the popish enormities, superstitions, absurdities, errours, impieties, and blasphemies; as upon the due consideration thereof, I could not but loath, detest, and abhorre all papistry; and stand at open defiance with the same. Especially, because at length I perfitly understood, that papistry in all ages, had civill warres against it self. Which thing is made so cleare and manifest by this little book, as more shall not need to be wished. I haue charitably and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully penned it, principally and chiefly for thy sake. And I nothing doubt but through the power of God, it will so sufficiently perswade thee, to use the ordinary meanes of thy salvation; that is, humbly to read the holy scriptures, which hath not heretofore bene thy custome; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to frequent godly sermons, which are nowe common in this Realme, God be thanked: and often to conferre with zealous preachers, for thy better instruction and sound confirmation; as thou wilt shortly be a greater enemy to popery, then thou wast before a friend thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For in this small volume thou shalt perceive evidently, that not only popish monkes, fryers, and Iesuites; but also their schoolemen, their Summists, their Canonistes, their Thomistes, their Scotists, their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, their Byshops, their Archbishoppes, their Cardinals, yea, and their greatest popes themselues, haue all in their domesticall dissentions and ciuill warres, so battered and made equall with the ground, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes of their popery; as no forraine enemy shall henceforth need, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stand in feare of their fortresses, or to make assaults against the
<pb facs="8"/>
same. So surceasing to speak of their muttering upon beads; their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in straunge tongues; their consecrations of bells, Churches, altars, chalices, patines, corporals, copes, vestments, albes, girdles, tunicles, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles, miters; their exorcismes or incantations ouer oyles, chrismes, ashes, palmes, candles, salt, water, bread; their sacrificing upon such altars, in such Churches, before such relikes; to which their sacrifices such sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and merits are ascribed, as that seminary is deemed best disposed for English long intended invasion; who hath occupied himselfe most busily, in that their superstitious kind of doting; their reservations of their bread-gods, often putrified, and now and then of myse devoured; their idolatricall adoration of reliques, especially of their so termed <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sanctus:</hi> surceasing I say, from speaking of these and like popish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liraments, and instantly wishing thy christian conversion in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, I bid thee heartily fare-well.</p>
