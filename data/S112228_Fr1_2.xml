   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anifold haue been the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men, concerning the soueraigne good and welfare of mankinde.<note place="margin">Different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about mans soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good. Epicures.</note> The swinish Epicures sought it in sensualitie and carnall delights; and to couer their shame, haue bestowed great trauaile to disguise their lady pleasure, and to make her goe for an honest woman.<note place="margin">Stoiks.</note> The Stoicks placed their welfare in morall vertue, and in the right reigning of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: as though man were made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and not for common societie: &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring least their surmised felicitie should fall to the ground, they haue sought
<pb facs="3"/> to vnderprop it with health, wealth, strength, courage, measurable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp;c. The Peripateticks<note place="margin">Peripateticks.</note> make two sorts of blessednes, the one consisting in action, which is politike or ciuill; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in contemplation, which they call wisdome. The Academicks<note place="margin">Academicks.</note> or Platonists mount somewhat higher, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that contemplation is but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wrastling, sometimes against the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie of things, and sometimes against the dimnes of our minds: say that felicitie is, to be ioyned vnto God, and to become like vnto him, who is the furthest end, the highest top, &amp; the vttermost bound of all blessednes. Thus some of them haue gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the darknes of this world, for that which cannot be found here: and others haue soared aloft, but yet far too short in finding out that resting poynt, whereat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought to aime.<note place="margin">True religion the meanes to attaine our well fare, and what true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is.</note> How thē must we attaine vnto it? surely by that which they knew not, that is to wit, true religiō: which is the right rule of seruing God, &amp; of reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
<pb facs="3"/> mā vnto him, that he may be saued: of the which true religion there be three especiall marks, so much the more worthy of deepe impression in our minds, because many foolish ceremonies haue disguised themselues in the attire of true religion.</p>
   <p>The first marke is,<note place="margin">The first marke of true religion.</note> to worship the onely God of Israel: wherein behold how Sathan hath tyrannized ouer mankind, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mē forge as many gods, as they had fancies: as that people in Africke, who worshipped that which they met first in the morning; or the Assyrians, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as many gods as they had townes; or the Persians,<note place="margin">Mans vanitie being destitute of Gods word.</note> that worshipped as many gods as there be fires in the earth, or stars in the skie; or the Aegyptiās, that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as many gods as they had plants or trees; or the Romans, who subduing nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wan their superstitions, &amp; so became the sinck-pan of Idolatries. In a word, the diuell by Gods permission so deluded the world, that some made gods of their goods, some worshipped the beasts which
<pb facs="4"/> God gaue them for their benefite, some builded Temples to their passions, some made gods of themselues, some deified their kings, as the Aegyptians their king <hi>Apis,</hi> the Babylonians their <hi>Belus,</hi> the Macedonians their <hi>Cabyrus,</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines their <hi>Faunus,</hi> the Sabines their <hi>Saucus,</hi> the Romans their <hi>Quirinus:</hi> what Christians will not shudder at the rememberance of such mysteries, when <hi>Euripides</hi> could speake thus:
<q>
         <l>
            <note place="margin">Euripides.</note>Thou <hi>Neptune,</hi> and thou <hi>Iupiter</hi> likewise,</l>
         <l>with other gods, whom faining words disguise,</l>
         <l>If that due Iustice vnto you were doone,</l>
         <l>both heauē &amp; temples should be emptie soone.</l>
      </q> Then the first chiefe note of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, that the true immortall God be onely worshipped, who founded the earth, and stretched out his meat-line ouer it, who shutteth vp the sea within the banks, and boundeth the waters, who maketh light and darknes, holdeth backe the Pleiades; and vnbindeth Orion, who spreadeth out the heauens like a curtaine,
<pb facs="4"/> and maketh his chambers in the depths, who maketh the windes his messengers, and the elements his seruants. This I say is the true God, who in his worship admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no collaterall companions: and as for the rest, gods in name, and not in nature, they are like vnto dog leaches, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse but the curing of one disease onely, or common craftsmen which professe but the skill of some one mysterie.</p>
   <p>The second marke of true religion is,<note place="margin">The second marke of true religion.</note> that we serue this onely God aright. As for the Philosophers, they also were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this poynt, but so that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies too wide or too short: for which of them euer said that God is a spirite, and ought to be serued in spirite? True it is, they set downe many morall precepts for direction of mens manners: but when they come to the matters of God, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speake of them dreamingly, or deeme of them ouerthwartly; yea, the seruices of God, inuented by man, are but so many childish imaginations, not onely vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
<pb facs="5"/> the maiestie of God, but farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the discretion of a man: as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, stage plaies, running of horses, sword playings, wrastlings, buffetings, and such like. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, commendeth a certaine answere of <hi>Symonides</hi> to <hi>Hieron.</hi> King of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which was, that none but God ought to haue skill of things that are aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much lesse then to dispose of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to shew the meanes how to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount nature. The countrie clowne should shew himselfe ridiculous, if hee should take vpon him to set downe how his Prince should be serued: and yet is he a man as well as his Prince, differing in state, and not in nature. What is to be said then of man, being a worme, &amp; lesse then a worme, in respect of the euerliuing God, if he will needs prescribe him his seruice? Surely as none can see the sunne, but by the helpe of the sunne; so none can serue God,<note place="margin">The third marke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> but by the light of his word.</p>
   <p>There is a third marke, without the
<pb facs="5"/> which religion (although in it selfe the path to saluation) is nothing else but a booke wherein we reade the sentence of our owne deaths. Therefore religion must shew vs a meanes to satisfie Gods Iustice: without the which, not onely all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, but euen that which conteineth the true seruice of God were vnauaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Indeed mans reason perceiued that some meanes was needful to make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but what it was, reason was too shallow to finde out. The Platonists haue busied themselues about many clensings, but to small purpose: others say it must bee done by abstinence, good behauiour, <hi>Iupiters</hi> mysteries, &amp;c. <hi>Hierocles</hi> said, that religion is the studie of wisdome, which consisteth in perfecting and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selues, that men may be at one with God: which perfection also, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in confession of sinnes (as he saith) but alas, whereas in religion we looke for life, vpon confession followeth death. Then to finde a planke to saue vs from
<pb facs="6"/> shipwrack, religion sheweth three persons in vnitie, of one essence coeternal, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall in all respects: the Father as the ground and wellspring: the Sonne as the euerlasting word and wisdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the holy Ghost as the bond of loue, whereby the Father and the Sonne are linked together. The one of these must make attonement: for God himselfe must be faine to step in betwixt his Iustice and his mercie, and as he created vs at the first, so to create vs new againe: and as he created vs in fauour, so now to acquite vs from wrath: and as he vttered his power and wisdome in making vs, so now to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his wisdome and goodnes in repairing vs. But yet beholde a mysterie, this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite godhead is not to discharge our diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,<note place="margin">These spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode by a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as the like, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28</note> otherwise then with obedience, nor our vndesert, otherwise then with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, nor our pride, otherwise then with lowlines, neither is he to purchase grace but by punishment, nor a crowne but by suffering, neither life but by death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="6"/> would hee abase himselfe that hee might obey; serue, that he might deserue, stoope downe beneath himselfe, that hee might become lowly; become weake, that he might suffer; become mortall, that he might die. Therefore was it behoouefull that our mediatour should be God and man: man to be borne vnder the law, God to performe the law; man to serue, God to set free: man to humble himselfe to the vttermost, God to exalt himselfe aboue all things; man to suffer, God to ouercome; man to die, and God to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer death. And sythence it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him of his infinit goodnes to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for vs, himselfe no way bound, needs must his obedience become a discharge for the disobedience; his desert, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the vndesert, &amp; his sufferings a satisfaction for the stubburnnes of them that beleeue in him. Now then if religion should but send vs to the true God, what were that more then the sending of an offender to the Iudge, or a laying of
<pb facs="7"/> stubble to the fire, considering that God is infinitly good, and man infinitly euill. Secondly, and if in religion we should but reade the will of the creator, what haue we yet found since mankinde is corrupt from his roote, and rotten at the core; but our owne enditements, arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and condemnations? Therefore this third note of religion, by making sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sins by the death of Christ, is the verie substance, and in shape of it, without the which it should be altogether vnprofitable. Now all this serueth first to shew you the tyrannie of Sathan ouer mankinde, and the horrible darkenes whereinto it is plunged, being destitute of the aide of Gods word and his holy spirit. Secondly, how greatly we are bound to receiue our gracious calling, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Gods holy religion, by which we are brought to that soueraigne good, for the which wee were made and created, and without the which hauing all things else, yet are most miserable: for proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="7"/> hast thou the authoritie and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of a Prince. Let Princes say whether one rebellion of their subiects doe not more vexe them,<note place="margin">No welfare to be found in this world.</note> than all their honorable triumphs can reioyce them. Art thou exalted to honour? let honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons say whether they bee not spitefull or spited, doing mischiefe, or receiuing mischiefe, ouermating or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Honour is but vertues shadow, a winde that makes many swell, but cannot satisfie. Art thou rich and wealthie? Let Merchants say what wealth is worth, since sea can drowne it, fire consume it, pyrates and robbers bereaue vs of it. To loue riches, is to doe as children doe, which take their greatest delite in pins and checkstones: or as fooles, which should deeme the goodnes of an horse to consist in his strappings. Art thou beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull? Let the daughters of vanitie say whether the sunne doth not tanne it, or a starre doth not blemish it, or sickenes doth not waste it, or olde age doth not
<pb facs="8"/> weare it. Beautie is but a vaine thing, and gladdeth more the beholders, then the hauers. Art thou strong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie? Let al the world say whether mans bodie be not subiect to a thousand disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, fraught with frailties within, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in miseries without; vncertaine of life, sure of death. Now what are all these and the rest, but resemblances of the apples that grow about Sodome, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the eye, and prouoking to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but vanishing into smoke, being touched with the teeth? Therefore it is onely true religion that leadeth Prince and people, noble and vnnoble, rich and poore to true felicitie, and reuniteth them vnto God. Happie be that day, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from aboue, in the which God gaue vs this token of his fauour: let that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth be respected of God, and let it be the head of the yeare: let all such as loue their saluations, blesse that day wherein they were redeemed from the darkenes of Sodom, and of Aegypt, and the day
<pb facs="8"/> starre of righteousnesse appeared vpon them: yea let it be made the beginning of the supputation of yeares, as we reade that the Iewes reckened their yeares from the yeares of Iubilee, and from the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> time: for then commeth the true yeare of Iubilee, the yeare of freedome and deliuerance from bondage, when the Gospell which is the glad tidings of saluation commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
   <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">Temporall blessings haue accompanied religion.</note> that nothing might bee wanting to make vs with ioye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Gods holy religion, beholde since the Church hath begun to flourish, and to spread her boughes throughout the whole land, the common wealth hath neuer been endowed with more ornaments of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
