   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough commonlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, moste worthie and renoumed Soueraine, seketh specially to commend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolle the thing, where unto he feleth hymself naturally bent and inclined, yet al soche par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallitie and priuate affection laid aside, it is to bee thought (that for the defence, maintenaunce, and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of a Kyngdome, or Common weale, or for the good and due obseruacion of peace, and administraciō of Iustice in thesame) no one thinge to be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, necessarie, or more honourable, then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of seruice in warre, and dedes of armes: bicause consideryng the ambicion of the worlde, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any realme or dominion, long to continue free in quietnesse and sauegarde, where the defence of the sweard is not alwaies in a readinesse. For like as the Grekes, beyng occupied aboute triflyng matters, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng pleasure in resityng of Comedies, and soche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain thinges, altogether neclecting Marciall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, gaue occasion to Philip kyng of Macedonia, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Alexander the Great, to oppresse and to bring theim in seruitude, vnder his subieccion, euen so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, libertie will not be kepte, but men shall be troden vnder foote, and brought to moste horrible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and calamitie, if thei giuyng theim selues to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stymes and pleasure, for slake the iuste regarde of their owne defence, and sauegarde of their countrie, whiche in temporall regimente, chiefly consisteth in warlike skilfulnesse. And therefore the aunciente Capitaines
<pb facs="3"/> and mightie Conquerours, so longe as thei florished, did deuise with moste greate diligence, all maner of waies, to bryng their men to the perfect knowledge of what so euer thing appertained to the warre: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appereth by the warlike games, whiche in old time the Princes of Grecia ordained, vpon the mount Olimpus, and also by thorders and exercises, that the aunciente Romaines vsed in sundrie places, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> and in their wonderful sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Theaters, whiche chiefly thei builded to that purpose. Whereby thei not onely made their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours so experte, that thei obtained with a fewe, in faightyng againste a greate houge multitude of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, soche marueilous victories, as in many credible Histories are mencioned, but also by thesame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, their vnarmed and rascalle people that followed their Campes, gotte soche vnderstandyng in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of warre, that thei in the daie of battaile, beeyng lefte destitute of succour, were able without any other help, to set themselues in good order, for their defence againste the enemie, that would seke to hurte theim, and in soche daungerous times, haue doen their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie so good seruice, that verie often by their helpe, the aduersaries haue been put to flight, and fieldes moste happely wōne. So that thantiquitie estemed nothing more happie in a common weale, then to haue in the same many men skilfull in warlike affaires: by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whereof, their Empire continually inlarged, and moste wonderfully and triumphantly prospered. For so longe as men for their valiauntnesse, were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and had in estimacion, glad was he that could finde occasion to venter, yea, and spende his life, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite his countrie: as by the manly actes that Marcus Curcius, Oracius Cocles, and Gaius Mucius did for the sauegarde of Rome, and also by other innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like examples, dooeth plainly appeare. But when through long and continuall peace, thei began to bee altogether giuē to pleasure and delicatenesse, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardyng
<pb facs="3"/> Marciall feates, nor soche as were expert in the practise thereof: Their dominions and estates, did not so moche before increase and prospere, as then by soche meanes and ouersight, thei sodainly fell into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caie and vtter ruine. For soche truly is the nature and condicion, bothe of peace and warre, that where in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente, there is not had equalle consideracion of them bothe, the one in fine, doeth woorke and induce, the others obliuion and vtter abholicion. Wherfore, sith the necessitie of the science of warres is so greate, and also the necessarie vse thereof so manifeste, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Ladie Peace her self, doeth in maner from thens craue her chief defence and preseruacion, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse moreouer, and honour of thesame so greate, that as by profe we see, the perfecte glorie therof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easely finde roote, but in the hartes of moste noble couragious and manlike personages, I thought most excellente Princes, I could not either to the specialle gratefiyng of your highnesse, the vniuersall delight of all studious gentlemen, or the common vtilitie of the publike wealth, imploie my labours more profitablie in accomplishyng of my duetie and good will, then in settyng foorthe some thing, that might induce to the augmentyng and increase of the knowledge thereof: inespecially thexample of your highnes most politike gouernemente ouer vs, giuyng plaine testimonie of the wonderfull prudente desire that is in you, to haue your people instructed in this kinde of seruice, as well for the better defence of your highnesse, theim selues, and their countrie, as also to discourage thereby, and to be able to resist the malingnitie of the enemie, who otherwise would seeke peraduenture, to inuade this noble realme or kyngdome.</p>
   <p>When therfore about .x. yeres paste, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours warres against the Mores and certain Turkes beyng in Barberie, at the siege &amp; winnyng of Calib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Monesterio and Africa, I had as well for my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instruction in those affaires, as also the better to
<pb facs="4"/> acquainte me with the Italian tongue, reduced into Englishe, the booke called <hi>The arte of VVarre,</hi> of the famous and excellente <hi>Nicholas Machiauell,</hi> whiche in times paste he beyng a counsailour, and Secretarie of the noble Citee of Florence, not without his greate laude and praise did write: and hauyng lately againe, somwhat perused thesame, the whiche in soche conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall broiles and vnquietnesse, was by me translated, I determined with my self, by publishyng thereof, to bestowe as greate a gift (sins greater I was not able) emongeste my countrie men, not experte in the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tongue, as in like woorkes I had seen before me, the Frenchemen, Duchemen, Spaniardes, and other forreine nacions, moste louyngly to haue bestowed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeste theirs: The rather vndoubtedly, that as by priuate readyng of thesame booke, I then felt my self in that knowledge marueilously holpen and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so by communicatyng thesame to many, our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishemen findyng out the orderyng and disposyng of exploictes of warre therein contained, the aide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of these plaine and briefe preceptes, might no lesse in knowledge of warres become incomperable, then in prowes also and exercise of thesame, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inuincible: which my translacion moste gracious Soueraine, together with soche other thynges, as by me hath been gathered, and thought good to adde thereunto, I haue presumed to dedicate vnto youre highnes: not onely bicause the whole charge and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of warlike counsailes and preparacions, being determined by the arbitremente of Gouernours and Princes, the treatise also of like effecte should in like maner as of right, depende vpon the protection of a moste worthie and noble Patronesse, but also that the discourse it self, and the woorke of a forrein aucthour, vnder the passeport and safeconduite of your highnes moste noble name, might by speciall aucthoritie of the same, winne emōgest your Maiesties subiectes, moche better credite and estimacion. And if mooste mightie
<pb facs="4"/> Queen, in this kind of Philosophie (if I maie so terme it) graue and sage counsailes, learned and wittie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes, or politike and prudente admonicions, ought not to be accōpted the least and basest iewels of weale publike. Then dare I boldely affirme, that of many straungers, whiche from forrein countries, haue here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore in this your Maiesties realme arriued, there is none in comparison to bee preferred, before this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Florentine and Italian, who hauyng frely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any gaine of exchaunge (as after some acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce and familiaritie will better appeare) brought with hym moste riche, rare and plentifull Treasure, shall deserue I trust of all good Englishe hartes, most louingly and frendly to be intertained, embraced and cherished. Whose newe Englishe apparell, how so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it shall seme by me, after a grosse fasion, more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appoincted to the Campe, then in nice termes atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Carpet, and in course clothyng rather putte foorthe to battaile, then in any braue shewe prepared to the bankette, neuerthelesse my good will I truste, shall of your grace be taken in good parte, hauyng fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned the phraise of my rude stile, euen accordyng to the purpose of my trauaile, whiche was rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the desirous manne of warre, then to delight the eares of the fine Rethoriciā, or daintie curious schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne: Moste humblie besechyng your highnes, so to accept my labour herein, as the first fruictes of a poore souldiours studie, who to the vttermoste of his smalle power, in the seruice of your moste gracious maiestie, and of his countrie, will at al tymes, accordyng to his bounden duetie and allegeaunce, promptlie yeld hym self to any labour, trauaile, or daunger, what so euer shal happen. Praiyng in the mean season the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie GOD, to giue your highnes in longe prosperous raigne, perfect health, desired tranquilitie, and against all your enemies, luckie and ioifull victorie.</p>
