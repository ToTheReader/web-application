   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eceiue (Christian Reader) a proofe of the force of Truth, and a presage of the end of that worke God is about to doe in these last Ages: A man brought vp in the Learning of Egypt, and enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Sorceries of Babel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe or counsell of any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, by occasion of Popish Tyrannie, searching the trueth, findeth out their error in Doctrine, and abuses in Discipline: and conuinced of both, first in his mind forsaketh their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and now in his body fleeth from their societie. This is not like to the change of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> and <hi>Arrius</hi> of olde, or of <hi>Carrier</hi> in our time, whose miscontented humour, for hopes disappointed, made them alter their opinion: But more like to that of <hi>Paulus Vergerius</hi> Bishop of Iustinople, whom vniust suspitions at the first burdened with a secret fauour of Lutheranisme: for purging whereof he intended a refutation of <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine. But while hee wrangled with the Truth, to ouercome it, he was taken captiue of it; and leauing his place and dignities, rendred himselfe at Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to our Profession.</p>
   <p>The ground of our presage, is Gods truth in times accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, wherein Prouidence goes on with remarkeable degrees of persons, and places, not without some respect to the Periods of time. He raised <hi>Wickleff</hi> from their Schooles, <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> from their Pulpits, <hi>Martin Luther</hi> from their
<pb facs="5"/>
Cloysters, and now <hi>Marke Antony</hi> from their Archiepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Chaire. The places haue the like gradation: Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine seemeth too farre from Rome, to waken them by <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleffs</hi> crie: therefore it founded nearer in Germanie. And now Dalmatia looking ouer the Venetian Gulfe, assureth Italy, that her next Aduertiser shall bee within her bowels. It was more than a Poeticall Licence to apply <hi>Sybilla's</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christ to <hi>Saloninus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Pollio,</hi> for keeping in memorie his victorie, in taking in Salonas. But this our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loninus</hi> maketh large restitution, and applieth the Oracles of God to the owne purpose: As the Clergie hath gone before, so Princes doe follow: The King of Great Brittaine, with most of the Princes of Germany, stand out already against Rome: the ambiguitie of France will resolue in the end in an open departure: and the temporizing of Venice impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more the want of occasion, than of will and resolution. The Romane Empire did stretch out it selfe by degrees, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the mids to the extremities, as circles goe out from the Center: and at the extremities againe their ruine began, and went backe to the heart. The fall of their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Monarchy shall keepe the same course.</p>
   <p>The Periods of time haue their owne obseruation. The Iewish solemnitie of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> not brought into the Church till the thirteenth Age, was then tyed to the Centenarie number: and that their ioy hath since proued to bee like the song of the Marmaid before a storme: for soone after, <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleffe</hi> began to trouble their mirth: and in the end of that Age <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> made them some more businesse, till in the 1415. yeere, the holy Fathers, at Constance by a Punicke faith, brought him to the fire. An hundred yeeres after him, <hi>Luther</hi> renewed his song with greater boldnesse, and in the 1517. yeere gaue out his Propositions against the Pope: from which time they haue perswaded themselues, and euen to this day assure their followers, that <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine can stand no longer then an hundred yeeres. This present yere closeth that Period: and while they looke for an euanishing of that Doctrine, behold, euen from themselues it receiueth
<pb facs="5"/>
againe a new light, a new testimonie. Wee hold with <hi>Plato</hi> the fatalitie of Periods, but <hi>Pythagoras</hi> numbers are too weake a ground for such a necessitie: or if we shall take any numbers, it must be these of sinne; and in sinne, more the degrees then the numbers: The Amorites sinnes must come to the height, and the Iewes must fill their cup before their punishment. The Pharisees of our time doe mightily to fill out their measure. The pride and filthines of Sodom, the whoredomes of Babel are now multiplied exceedingly; and the greatest sinne, euen that to death, is become an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemicke disease among their Clergie. <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth, <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. can scoffe at it, <hi>Gardinerus</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it at his death, but with this addition: That it must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther still be impugned, then the state of Rome decay. All their wits runne vpon this one point, but all their meanes turne vpon them. The crueltie of their inquisition, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of their Prohibitions, their impudencie in falsifying words and writs, giue them but a moments aduantage. But euen from these shall come their ruine. A lie hath no more strength than for the time it is spoken and credulously em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: but the eternall force of Truth hath more than a moment any preuailing. What then resteth for them, but that they giue place to the fatalitie of their estate, since they will not giue place to the Truth. And for vs, while Rome is renting in it selfe, take heed that we be not diuided. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer now casteth the apple of strife into the Reformed Church, proueth an enemie to God, and an improfitable friend to Antichrist. Let vs stand still, and behold the work of the Lord, and be sure, while we imagine we haue left Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, that we haue first forsaken Egypt.</p>
