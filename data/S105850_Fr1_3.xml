         <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing (gentle Readers)</hi> by reason of a trifling woorke of mine (which, by reason of the lightnesse of it, or at least of the keeper of it, flewe abroade before I knewe of it) already wonne such fame, as he which fyred the Temple of <hi>Dianae,</hi> I thought it stoode mee vppon, to purchase to my selfe some better fame by some better woorke, and to counteruayle my former Vanitie, with some formal grauitie. And though I knowe all fame to be daungerous, for that if it be good, enuie foloweth it, and if it be yll, shame accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyeth it: yet, seeing report once spread, cannot be reuoked, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> (such was your courtesie) I doubte not now but to escape a fewe stragling shot in a lyght skirmishe, without so much as bearyng the discharge of their Peeces: for the men which wyll assayle me, are in deede rather to be counted friendly foes, then deadly enimies, as those who wyll neyther mislyke with me, nor with the matter which I shall present vnto them, but tendryng, as it were, my credite, thynke it conuenient that such as I am (whose profession should chiefely be armes) should eyther spende the tyme in wryting of Bookes, or publyshe them beyng written. Those which mislyke studie or learnyng in Gentlemen, are some freshe water Souldiers, who thynke that in warre it is the body which only must beare the brunt of all, not knowyng that the body is ruled by the minde, and that in all doubtfull and daungerous matters, it is the minde only which is the man: but hauing shewed els where how necessarie learning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for Souldiers, I ad only, that if we in <hi>England</hi> shall frame our selues only for warre, yf we be not very well Oyled, we shall hardly keepe our selues from rustyng, vvith such long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ance of peace, it hath pleased God to blesse vs. Those vvhich
<pb facs="4"/>
mislike that a Gentleman should publish the fruites of his learning, are some curious Gentlemen, vvho thynke it most commendable in a Gentleman, to cloake his arte and skill in euery thyng, and to seeme to doo all thynges of his ovvne mother vvitte as it vvere: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering hovv vve deserue no prayse for that, vvhich God or Nature hath bestovved vpon vs, but only for that, vvhich vve purchace by our owne industry: and if you shall chaunce to enter into reasonyng with them, they wyll at the seconde woorde make protestation that they are no Schollers: whereas notwithstanding they haue spent all theyr tyme in studie. Why Gentlemen is it a shame to shewe to be that, which it is a shame not to be? In diuers thynges, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng so good as Learning. You are desirous to seeme to be that, which you are not, and in Learning, the best thyng of all others, are you afearde to shewe to be that, which you are? Alas you wyll be but vngentle Gentlemen, yf you be no Schollers: you wyll doo your Prince but simple seruice, you vvyll stande your Countrey but in slender steade, you vvyll bryng your selues but to small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, yf you be no Schollers. Can you counsayle your Prince wysely, foresee daungers prouidently, gouerne matters of state discreetely, without Learning? no, experience must then be your guide, which wyll be but a blynde one: it must be your Scholemaister. but you shall finde it a dangerous one. To come lower, can you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Strangers, inquire the state of forraine Countries, geue entertainement to Ambassadours, being no Schollers? no surely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be with dum shewes and signes: lyke as of late a pleasaunt Gentleman (who could haue spoken sufficiently, yf he had been put to it) being amongst others commaunded to ryde to meete an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoure that was commyng to the Court, at his returne a Noble man asked hym merily, what he sayd to the Ambassadoure when he met hym: nothyng (sayd he) but kist my Horses mayne, and came my way. To come lowest of all, Can you so much as tell your Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse a fine tale, or delight her with pleasant deuice, beyng vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? no it must needes eyther be altogether vnsauerie, or els sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the salte of others: and whether thynke you it more shame that you should shew to haue of your owne, or that she should knowe you filche from others? You knowe <hi>Caesar</hi> was a braue
<pb facs="4"/>
Gentleman, but yet he was a Scholler, but yet he wrote Bookes, but yet he came in print. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was an Emperour, but he was learned, and set foorth learned woorkes. Therefore (Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) neuer deny your selues to be Schollers, neuer be ashamed to shewe your learnyng, confesse it, professe it, imbrace it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor it: for it is it which honoureth you, it is only it which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you men, it is onely it whiche maketh you Gentlemen: And marke this when you wyll, yf there be any in any place, which seeketh to come vp, or benefite hym selfe by flatterie, by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, by slauerie, by vallanie, I dare warrant you he is altogether vnlearned: for hauyng no good partes, no good giftes in hym which may preferre hym, he flyeth to those sinister shyftes as his surest stayes: whereby you see that it is Learnyng which accomplisheth a Gentleman, and the want of it which blemisheth hym: and that neither comlinesse of personage, neither gaynesse of garmentes, neither any exteriour Ornamentes are to be compared to the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Learning, without which, though a man shake the feather after the best fashion, and take vpon hym neuer so bygly▪ he shall neuer be accounted of amongst the wyse, nor neuer be filed on the roale of ryght and sufficient Gentlemen. And this I hope wyll sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie those which mislyke that Gentlemen should publishe the fruites of their studie, especially seeing thereby Learning is aduaunced, and a great number pleasured and profited: and seeing the only way to win immortalitie, is either to doo thinges woorth the writing, or to write thynges woorthy the readyng? And yf they obiecte that that seeking of immortalitie, is a signe of vayne glory: to answere them playnely and humanely, I am flat of this minde, that they which passe not of prayse, wyll neuer doo any thyng woorthy prayse. There are some others yet who wyll set lyght by my labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I write in Englysh: and those are some nice Trauaylours, who returne home with such quaesie stomackes, that nothyng wyll downe with them but <hi>Frenche, Italian,</hi> or <hi>Spanishe,</hi> and though a woorke be but meanely written in one of those tongues, and finely translated into our Language, yet they wyll not sticke farre to preferre the Originall before the Translation: the cause is partly, for that they cannot so soone espie faultes in a forraigne Tongue
<pb facs="5"/>
as in their owne, which maketh them thynke that to be curraunt, which is but course, and partly for that strange thynges doo more delyght them, then that which they are dayly vsed to: but they consider not the profite which commeth by readyng thynges in their owne Tongue, whereby they shall be able to conceiue the matter much sooner, &amp; beare it away farre better, then yf they reade it in a strange Tongue, whereby also they shall be inabled to speake, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to write, to indite, properly, fitly, finely, and wysely, but the woorst is, they thinke that impossible to be doone in our Tongue: for they count it barren, they count it barbarous, they count it vnworthy to be accounted of: and, which is woorse, as I my selfe haue heard some of them, they report abrode, that our Countrey is barbarous, our maners rude, and our people vnciuile: and when I haue stoode with them in the comparison betweene other Countreys and ours, and poynted with my finger to many grosse abuses, vsed in the places where we haue ben, when by no reason they haue ben able to defende them, they haue shronke in their necke, and tolde me that it was the fashyon of the Countrey: not considering that the maners and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of eche Countrey, are the only thyng that make it counted barbarous or ciuile, good or bad. But for our Countrey, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that those which know it, and loue it, wyl report it for the ciuilest Countrey in the worlde: and if it be thought to be otherwyse by strangers, the disorders of those traueylers abrode are the chiefe cause of it. And to speake but of the lyghtest, their enuying one another, their deprauing one another, their flowing one another, their falling out one with another, their fighting one with another in the open streete (as with blushyng I haue often behelde in <hi>Paris</hi>) their contemning of their Countrey fashions, their apish imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of euery outlandish Asse in their gestures, behauour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, are the only causes that make Strangers count our Countrey and our people barbarous: for at home it is well knowne that vve liue in lawes as orderly, in maners as decently, in apparrell as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> our tongue, and make it copious, and it is the vvay vvhich all tongues haue taken to inrich them selues: For take the Latine vvoords from the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue, and it shall be as barren as most part of their Countrey: take them from the <hi>Italian,</hi> and you take avvay in a manner the vvhole tongue: take them from the <hi>Frenche,</hi> and you marre the grace of it: yea take from the Latine it selfe the vvoords deriued from the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and it shall not be so flovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flourishing as it is. Wherefore I marueile hovv our english tongue hath cracke it credite, that it may not borrovv of the Latine as vvell as other tongues: and if it haue broken, it is but of late, for it is not vnknovven to all men hovv many vvoordes vve haue fetcht from thence vvithin these fevve yeeres, vvhich if they should be all counted inkepot termes, I knovv not hovv vve should speake any thing vvithout blacking our mouthes vvith inke: for vvhat vvoord can be more plaine then this vvord <hi>plaine,</hi> &amp; yet vvhat can come more neere to the Latine? What more manifest, then <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi>? and yet in a manner Latine: What more commune then <hi>rare,</hi> or lesse rare then commune, and yet both of them comming of the Latine? But you vvyll say, long vse hath made these vvoords cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt: and vvhy may not vse doo as much for these vvoords vvhich vve shall novv deriue? Why should not vve doo as much for the posteritie, as vve haue receiued of the antiquitie? and yet if a thing be of it selfe ill, I see not hovv the oldnesse of it can make it good, and if it be of it selfe good, I see not hovv the nevvnesse of it can make it naught: Wherevpon I infer, that those vvoords vvhich your selues confesse by vse to be made good, are good the first time they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and therfore not to be iested at, nor to be misliked. But hovv hardly soeuer you deale with your tongue, how barbarous soeuer you count it, hovv litle soeuer you esteeme it, I durst my selfe vndertake
