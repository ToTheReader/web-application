   <head>To the Curteous Reader, grace, mercy, and peace.</head>
   <p>DEarly beloved, you may be pleased to remember, that not long since I set forth a Treatise under this Title, <hi>The worldlings look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasse,</hi> In which I promised to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this present Parable; And seeing promise is counted a due debt, though I have stayed long, before I have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that which I then undertooke, yet at last, as you see, I am as good as my word, and now tender you paiment. In this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Discourse, I have laid open the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate of all Hypocrites, who have Christ rife in their mouths, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would seeme better than any; when
<pb facs="6"/> as indeed they are worse than many, for God accountes a devout Hypocrite, no better than a prophane Epicure, he cannot endure a Devill though he be in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantell; and that because they respect not the reward of vertue, but the regard of men; as if vertue were not a sufficient recompence to it selfe. Happy is that man that can espy this cursed vice in himselfe; happier that laboures by the power of God to purge it out. They that will have helpe against this spirituall wickednesse, must seeke unto God, and get directions out of his Word, which is mighty through<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 3</note> God to the pulling downe of strong houlds. Praying dayly for the assistance of his<note place="margin">Eph. 6, 18.</note> Spirit, else it will not bee enough to fight with Gods weapons, unlesse wee borrow his arme. The enemy of our Saluation is powerfull, and therefore called the god<note place="margin">Eph. 2, 2.</note> of this World, and the Prince that ruleth in the Aire: who laboures mightily to keepe us in league with our sinnes. And therefore useth innumerable stratagems
<pb facs="6"/> to hinder us in our journey, to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Canaan: Working either upon the corruption of our nature, to disturbe us in the practise of Piety, or else by dishart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of us under the crosse, when wee should be most resolute for Gods glory: and therefore seeing he is so resolute to worke our ruine, it should make us carefull to<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 12.</note> worke out our owne salvation with feare and trembling, and give all diligence to make our calling and election sure, and to<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 10</note> let our conversation be such as becommeth the Gospell of Christ; that so we may bee<note place="margin">Phil. 1, 27.</note> blamelesse and harmelesse, the sonnes of God without rebuke in the middest of a<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 15.</note> crooked and perverse nation. Else if wee neglect the meanes of our salvation, and spend our daies in sensuality, carnall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity will seaze upon us, and then when we would cast off these bonds, wee cannot, because our Dalilahs; our own follies have beguiled us. Therefore seeing our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is so potent, and malicious, let us not<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5, 7</note> sleepe as doe other, but let us watch and
<pb facs="7"/> be sober. Nature can teach men to care for those things that concerne their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life; but it is grace that must teach men to minde those things that concerne their spiritual life: &amp; seeing that upon the breath of our lives hanges two eternities, the one of endlesse felicity, the other of easelesse and endlesse paines; what maner of persons ought we to be passing the time of our pilgrimage heerein feare, and with <hi>Iob, 14. 14.</hi> to waite all the daies of our appointed time, till our change come? Happy will that servant bee whome his Master when hee commeth shall finde so doing. But least I should seeme <hi>monere memorem,</hi> more laborious than need re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quires, I surcease, desiring you to accept of this simple scarce ripe fruit of these my Meditations, and to looke over my fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with an eye of compassion, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my slippes and infirmities with the mantell of Charity, for <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi> So shall I remaine thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you, and will endevour to provide
<pb facs="7"/> some better Present, whereby I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the sincerity of my affection towards them that feare the Lord. In the meane time I commend you to God, and this present worke to your charitable Censure, and my selfe to your Christian prayers, and alway rest,</p>

      <signed>Yours in the Lord to be commanded, Edmund Cobbes.</signed>
