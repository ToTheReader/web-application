   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O shew that your greatnesse in your selfe hath not made mee fearefull unto despaire, nor your graciousnesse toward me, bold unto presumption, in a modest confidence I now beg a long-since promised patronage: <hi>Horace,</hi> who either learned from, or taught the Spheres a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect musicall harmonie, and made the language of Rome truly Roman, (if we may beleeve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
<pb facs="3"/>was as meanly descended as my own selfe; yet did not his meannesse deprive him of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiarie <hi>Maecenas,</hi> a Roman Knight, high in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and (which was the greatest) in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces love: and it is questionable whether <hi>Horace</hi> were more helped by <hi>Maecenas</hi> hand, or <hi>Maecenas</hi> more honoured by <hi>Horace</hi> his pen: <hi>Horace</hi> lived well under <hi>Maecenas</hi> protection, <hi>Maecenas</hi> yet lives in <hi>Horace</hi> kis Poesie: <hi>Dignum laude Virum Musa vetat mori; Coelo musa beat.</hi> I now present unto your Honours hand, the same Poet, but in an English dresse; nor can it be more difficult to finde an English <hi>Maecenas,</hi> than to make an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Horace:</hi> It is not unknowne to those that have bent their studies this way, how hard it is to be tyed to the words and matter of another, especially in verse; and yet if you please gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to accept, and powerfully to protect my weake endeavours, I was never so much bound to my Authors phrase, as I shall be to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours favour. Vouchsafe a gracious aspect to these my labours, and I doubt not but those comfortable raies darted from your eyes, will now give mee life, as they have heretofore given me heat. The loftie riding Sunce in his diurnall course doth shine as bright on a meane cottage, as a Princes Palace; and though his beames can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raise it to an equall height, yet they impart light and comfort to both alike. I know the
<pb facs="3"/>Noblenesse of your disposition will accept of my Translation as well in parchment, as if it had been wrapped up in plush; in vellam as in vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet; considering the matter is still the same, as when that Muses darling <hi>Horace</hi> wrote it: a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cabinet cannot make gold better, nor a canvase bag, or iron chest diminish the worth of it. I leave my worke and selfe to your gracious patronage, and wish my selfe may ever be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as I desire to be</p>
