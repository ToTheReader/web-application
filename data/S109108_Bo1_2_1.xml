      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable
Reader) the booke and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
of the deuine and Illuster Poete,
<hi>Salust du Bartas,</hi> I was moued by the
oft reading &amp; perusing of them, with
a restles and lofty desire, to preas to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the like vertue. But s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)
God, by nature hathe refused me the like lofty and
quick ingyne, and that my dull <hi>Muse,</hi> age, and Fortune,
had refused me the lyke skill and learning, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to haue refuge to the secound, which was, to doe
what lay in me, to set forth his praise, sen I could not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
the lyke my self. Which I thought, I could not do so
well, as by publishing some worke of his, to this yle of
<hi>Brittain</hi> (swarming full of quick ingynes,) aswell as they
ar made manifest already to France. But knowing my self
to vnskilfull and grosse, to trāslate any of his heauenly &amp;
learned works, I almost left it of, and was ashamed of that
opinion also. Whill at the last, preferring foolehardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and a good intention, to an vtter dispaire and sleuth,
I resolued vnaduysedly to assay the translating in my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the easiest and shortest of all his difficile, and
<pb facs="16"/>
prolixed Poems: to wit, the <hi>Vranie</hi> or heauenlye Muse,
which, albeit it be not well translated, yet hope I, ye will
excuse me (fauorable Reader) sen I neither ordained it,
nor auowes it for a iust translation: but onely set it forth,
to the end, that, albeit the Prouerb saith, that foolehardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
proceeds of ignoraunce, yet some quick sprited man
of this yle, borne vnder the same, or as happie a Planet, as
<hi>Du Bartas</hi> was, might by the reading of it, bee moued to
translate it well, and best, where I haue bothe euill, and
worst broyled it.</p>
   <p>For that cause, I haue put in, the French on the one side
of the leif, and my blocking on the other: noght thereby
to giue proofe of my iust translating, but by the contrair,
to let appeare more plainly to the foresaid reader, wherin
I haue erred, to the effect, that with lesse difficulty he may
escape those snares wherin I haue fallen. I must also desire
you to bear with it, albeit it be replete with innumerable
and intolerable faultes: sic as, Ryming in tearmes, and
dyuers others, whilkis ar forbidden in my owne treatise
of the Art of Poësie, in the hinder end of this booke, I
must, I say, praye you for to appardone mee, for three
causes. First, because that translations are limitat, and
restraind in somethings, more then free inuentions are,
Therefore reasoun would, that it had more libertie in
others. Secoundlie, because I made noght my treatise
of that intention, that eyther I, or any others behoued
astricktly to follow it: but that onely it should shew
the perfection of Poësie, whereunto fewe or none can
<pb facs="16"/>
attaine. Thirdlye, because, that (as I shewe alreadye)
I avow it not for a iust translation. Besydes that
I haue but ten feete in my lyne, where he hath twelue,
and yet translates him lyne by lyne. Thus not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
fauorable Reader, but you will accept my
intention and trauellis in good parte,
(sen I requyre no farder,) I
bid you faire well.</p>
