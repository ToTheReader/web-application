   <head>TO THE FRENDLY READER, AS MVCH HEALTH AS HE WISHETH OF SOVLE AND BODY.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>En many times meddle in some matters, wherein they take more toile then thanke for their labors: and he which thinkes in the night, that he hath pleased all, shall find in the morning, that he hath angred some. So many as know me well, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I was chiefly addicted, within these eight or nine yeares, that is vnto the studie and practise of the soule Phisicke; may now make a question, of my medling so long vvith bodily Phisicke. But my two fold answer they may take with them, for their satisfaction. First that I keepe still <hi>Depositum illud,</hi> vvhich God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto me (and sealed the same, by mine own spirituall birth, and other mens sanctification) till he that hath said, Go, points the time, and giues the occasion, of my further seruice, in that waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie function. Secondly, as vvhen I conuersed in that calling, I vvas chargeable to none: so (not surceasing the same of mine owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) I haue since by God his blessing of my labors herein, as not greatly inriched my self: so not impouerished any. That vvherein I haue thus continued, sith it concerneth learning, and an honest mās maintenance, cannot or ought not offend any, that are well in their vvits. These few secrets, cōtained in this Collectiō and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix thereto adioyning (which I haue reduced into methode for his sake that gathered them here and there) cannot or ought not to scandalize any, that haue a sanctified cunning, in Phisicke or Chirurgerie. I must needes tell thee, that I leane more to that safe, speedy, and pleasant kind of curation with medecines rightly prepared, then to the carelesse composition, made by addition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simples, clogged with more impurities, then are in that simple, which they labour to correct. I dare also auouch, that any poore body, may better commit his crasie body, to be healed or helped, of any outward or inward maladie, by the right prepared medecines, for the value of ten shillings (which he can hardly spare) then a wealthy mā, to their deceits) I would say receits) for ten crownes,

which he may well inough forbeare: Many of the ignorant sort haue counted the chymicall or <hi>Paracelsicall</hi> Phisicke dangerous, and not without cause, for wofull experience hath brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that suspition. But (good Reader) heare me in that which He tell thee, and so take thine answere for this time. Some of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and most of the ignorant, haue in generall despised thē, but by your leaue after they haue heard in particular of the excellent successe attained by many of thē; they haue aduentured vpō those, without knowledge, experience, direction: and so haue made many patients to smart for it. Therfore I would not that the fine finge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Phisitian should scorne to weare this pearle, which is as fit for Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> Lack-latin, for the lādleaper, or cogging quackesaluer, as a pipe for an asse, or a cage for a cow. The salts, oyles, waters, extractes, tinctures, simples prepared, and cōpositiōs of simples cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned mentioned in this booke or not mentioned, I meane not to make sale of (as the Grocer doth or the Apothecary:) but I keepe them in store, and meane to increase them, for mine owne vse, and my frends, and for such as shall need thē, as the learned counsell, of Phisicke rules, shall giue occasion. The greatest part of them, were prepared by <hi>Iohn Hester</hi> of Paules wharfe, now deceased, a man that spēt much, &amp; indāgered his body, about such workes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many excellent men haue enioyed the benefite. The effect of his labour, hath and doth cōmend him, in Englād, and other coūtries, which haue these many yeares made proofe, of these his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All which as not lōg since I bought of the Suruiuer: so I am willing at all times, to part with any of thē, to salue the woūded, or heale the diseased. In the meane while and for euermore, I cōmit thee (Gentle Reader) in health or in sicknesse, to the protection of the Arch-Phisitian, and creator of our soules and bodies, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies preserue vs, and all that be his, vnto the end and in the end.</p>
