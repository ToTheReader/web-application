the foundacyon of all the scriptures / and

shortly compyled in this present boke / the
foundacyon and the somme of the holy sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripture

may knowe / whate he shall beleve / wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
he shall hope / &amp; whye he shall love god / 
and howe god is oure father / and we hys
children / and howe that we be enheriters
of the kingdome of god / as shewith vnto
vs saint Paul in all his epistles / in divers
chapters<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that without oure merites we be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to thintent that we shuld not put ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
trust in oure good workes / as dyd the
Iues. Neverthelesse albeit that I wryte
in this boke that God iustifieth vs wyth
out oure good workes and merites / it ys
not myne entent to discounsell eny mā to
do good werkes / but myne euient is to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
all persones howe they shall do the
<pb facs="3"/>
werkes / and that they shall not trust vpō
theire good werkes / nor in theym to seke
theire hel<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>▪ but all only in the feith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>su
Christ / and in the grace of god.</p>
   <p>This faith had Abraham / as writeth
saint Paule vnto the Romayns.<note place="margin">Ro. 4.</note> For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
beleved agaynst hope in hope.
That is to saye / that whiche by mannes
nature and vertue was impossible he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leved
alwayes hit shulde come to passe / e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyn
as god had promysed them. So must
every christen lyve ageinste hope in hope / 
that is to sey / hit behoveth that he repute
all his good workes for sinne / and thinke
that if god wolde iudge him accordinge to
his workes he might not be saved. For if
I haue done eny good hit is of God / and
not of me / for. I haue done it by the grace
of God / and therby I deserve no reward
And if I haue done eny thinge of my silfe
without the grace of god / hit is ypochrisye
and greate sinne / and therby I deserve
euerlastinge deth / wherfore then shall I
trust in my good workes / for I haue no
good workes / all my goodnesse belongeth
to god. So shulde a christē hūble him silfe
and repute all his good workes for sinne
<pb facs="3"/>
as truely they be As sheweth vnto vs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saye
saying / all oure rightuousnes be as
a clothe polluted with the floures af a wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man.<note place="margin">Esa. 64▪</note>
And when the person so distrusteth
of him silfe / and of his good workes he sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
hope agayn ageinst hope / and shall tr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ust
in the mercy of God / and shall beleve
forth on certaynly that he shalbe saved by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause
of the worde of God. For god hath
promysed to vs his realme to all theym / 
that trust in him / and god is faithfull and
veritable in his wordes / wherfore seyng
that god hath promysed it vnto vs▪ let vs
beleve it stebfastly / and haue ferme fayth
that we shalbe saved not by oure deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving / 
but by the promyses of god. And so
it behoveth that euery christen dispere ād
hope (as dyd Abraham) dispeyre of him sil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe / 
and then a newe to trust in the worde of
god. And these be the two thinges which
the lawe and the gospell doth. The lawe
maketh vs to dispeyre / because that we
never fulfill the cōmaundementes of god▪
These gospell (that is to say the grace of
the newe testament / maketh vs agayn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynly
to hope and to trust. And for to tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
these two thynges be wrytten all the

cript<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>res. The parson shall alweyes abi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
humylyte and alweyes thynke that
if god wolde iudge hym according to hys
workes he shulde never come vnto helth.
As sheweth vnto vs Iesus christe in.<note place="margin">Lu. 17</note> S.
Kuke sayng / when ye haue done all the
thinges whiche to you are commauded
say ye / we be vnprousitable servauntes / 
we haue done but oure dutye. And thys
is the verey Christen humylite / as in this
present boke shalbe more pleynly declared
And if we can thus repute all oure good
workes for sinne / ād in theym to have no
maner of trust and then ageyn beleve that
we shalbe saved by the promyses of god / 
we be the children of Abraham / of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
all the scriptures bere witnesse that by
his faith he was iustified / and gat helth.
And for that cause he is called the father of
belevers and of the feithfull. And this ys
the fayth wherof I wryte here ī this boke
to thintent that all parsones myght come
to knowledge and knowe whate ys the
Christen sayth. Of the whyche all the sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riptures
do speake / and namely the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
after S. Iohn / and the epistles of S.
Paule / for heryn do these two apostles cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb facs="4"/>
all other scripture.</p>
   <p>And for bicause that it behoueth that
the parson beleve that his faith iustifieth
him / and not his workes I haue shortly
compyled here and declared howe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yth
doth iustifie vs / and howe we be the
children of God / and howe we must ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
oure father by charite / and howe that
we shalt nothyng doubt of oure helth by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the wordes of God. And when
a parson getteth thys hope he learneth to
bere pacyenly all tribulacyon and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.
For he knoweth that this lyfe ys not
hys lyfe / and hath greate desyre aftrr the
other lyfe / and holdeth not this lyfe for
hys. And this maketh the fayth the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ys alwayes affectuously attendaunte
after Christ oure espouse. But he that
hath not this fayth is all desolate when he
hath mysfortune / and yf to hym yt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
well he gyveth hym silfe to voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osite
and sinne. And for bicause he hath
no hope of the everlasting life he thinkes
in him silf I will vse this life as long as it
is lēt me / And that he doth bicause he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not whate oure feith is / &amp; whate our
hope is / &amp; howe that we be the children, of
God.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
To thintent therfore that none gyue
him silfe to sinne by desperacion I have
shortly compyled in this present boke / ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
that we be iustified with out oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
For when eny parson hath done
his best with all his power / as I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yd / 
then let him say yet / that he is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proufitable
servaunt. And the humble her
te wherby he knowlegith his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
maketh that his sinnes / his evell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughtes
and the fragilite of his flesshe to
him be pardoned of god and that lytell th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he hath / god gyveth it him of him silfe / 
and god is his iustice / that is to saye / god
maketh him rightuous, for Iesu christ ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th
satisfied for vs vnto his hevēly father / 
for to come in socoure to oure infirmite.
And this describeth saint Paule in his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rst .viij.
chapters vnto the Romayns / and
in the first epistle vnto the Corinthyans / 
and saynt Iohn in the seconde chaptre of
his first epistle. And of this mater treateth
this present boke.</p>
   <p>The last part of this boke sheweth ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
all estates shulde lyve / if they will ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
according to the gospell. Myne intent
is not to refourme all estates aswell espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituell
<pb facs="5"/>
as seculer. For of that I will not
presume. But I shewe alonely by the sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riptures
howe we shulde lyve if we wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
lyve according to the gospell / to thintēt
that every man may knowe / howe farre
his life is separate from the doctrine of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>su
christ / and that then wyth the grace of
god he may amende and refourme his lyfe
him silfe.</p>
   <p>Nether teache I / that one shulde not
obey vnto the superiours <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>
but I teache them by whate meane they
shall knowe howe they shulde lyve / and
when they do not so lyve that then they
knowlege theyre defautes / &amp; do diligence
so to lyve. For els were better before god
