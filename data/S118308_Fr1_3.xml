      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas we formerly in a little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise / intituled <hi>a Declaration off Faith,</hi> of English people remayning <hi>at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> have in the fifth Article in short set downe our faith / of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> concerning salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condemnation: there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing bene som eprivate opposition since wee writt it / the love of God and vnto his truth constraineth vs to speake thus much more as we are able / for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynance of this cleere light of truth / that God hath not in his eternal decre apointed some perticuler men to be saved: and some perticuler men to be condemned and so hath redeamed but some: But that Christ is given <hi>a ransome for all men, yea even for the wicked, that bring swift damnation vpon themselves, denying the Lord that hath bought them.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, It may and wil seeme straing that we of all others should take in hand to denie in a cause of so great controversie / and so deepe a misterie: to which we aunswere / that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes vs asmuch as anie / and therefore though we be not so able as we desire we were / yet because we ought we are readie to shew our selves willing with the best abilitie we have: and in that it is a deepe misterie / (as the whole truth of God is) the more need had wee to search into i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: that by the grace of God we might find the depth of it / so far as God hath revealed in his word / as al men ought to doe. And we pray the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reader not to bee deceaved by that old deceipt of the misterie of iniquitie / the man of sinne which is / to perswade / that it is to high a point / and to deepe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie for thee to enter into / for by this deceipt hath the misterie of iniquitie prevailed / ād doth to this day prevaile / with thousands / and ten-thousands not to search into anie part off the Scriptures at all.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>But to rest vpon the faith of the Church: ād though manie (blessed be God) be broken out from that depth of darknes / yet they are not come to that cleare foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of light / to knowe / professe / and practice / that the Lord doth require at their hands to search into ād knowe / his whole truth / revealed in the scriptures. And for this misterie in had / let it be plaine vnto the that if thou oughest to knowe that a Saviour is sent / then thou oughest also to knowe to whome he is sent: ād if thou thinke to satisfie thy self in that thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west he is sent a saviour to thee / therein dost thou not seeke the glorie of God / nor the good of thy brother / and then the love of God is not in thee. Therefore cast away all excuse / and applie thy hart / withall care full diligence / and faithful vprightnes / to search / and find out the depth of this high point ād misterie / that thou maist give glorie to God / for sending his sonne <hi>a Saviour for all Men.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And so praying the God of light to make this truth also to breake furth and increase amongst you / as (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be his name) it hath done / and doth daylie breake furth and increase / in these partes / and that amongst them / which your selves accomt best reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Wee require thy loveing patience to beare with our wants / and thy conscionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that which is spoken to the / from the word of God / whose <hi>Spirit</hi> bee vpon thee / <hi>Amen.</hi>
