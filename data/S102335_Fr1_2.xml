      <salute>Most excellent Princesse</salute>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> May faile in Vulger <hi>Titles;</hi> But, in my valuation of your heroïcal Virtues, I cannot be deceaved. Therfor, I am the less curious in common <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi> For, those <hi>Accōplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which in my repute, are your greatest glorie, are well manifest in that, which is the greatest temporall honour; even in those <hi>Virtues,</hi> which have conquered a Kingdome for you, in the harts of many millions of people: And procured you thousands of affectionate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (who never sawe your Majestive) Not only in your owne Territories, and in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of your Freinds; But, in the Citties
<pb facs="3"/>
&amp; Kingdomes of your Enimies also: And, they who are vnwilling to confesse this, to give you honour; have honored you, in discovering it by their envy.</p>
   <p>Among those, who are in Affection, your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">ties</seg>
      </hi> loyall servants, I am one: and, in my owne Country, great multitudes have tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of a speciall <hi>Obligation,</hi> which I had, above many others, to honor &amp; serve you. For, I do hereby most humbly, &amp; thanck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge; that, when my over-forward <hi>Muse</hi> first fiutterd out of her neast, Shee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the preservation of her endangered <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,</hi> by your gratious favour: and perhaps, escaped also, thereby, that Pinioninge, which would have marred her flieng forth, for ever after.</p>
   <p>Which extraordinary Clemencie (in so great a <hi>Princesse,</hi> to a person so vndeservinge) did not only much magnify your noblenes, in the opinion of others, but so chayned my hart also, to the love of your princely Goodnes; that (all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was hitherto compelled to smother my vnprofitable thanckfulnes in my breast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I wanted meanes to discover it according to my desires) I have eversince, bene spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly present with your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">tie</seg>
      </hi> (&amp; with God, for
<pb facs="3"/>
you, by my Prayers) in all your <hi>Afflictions, &amp; Exaltations.</hi> And, faine I would have effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted something, which might have witnessed, that I had a <hi>Hart,</hi> though not a <hi>Fortune,</hi> to be serviceable in the best manner.</p>
   <p>My <hi>Muse,</hi> was the hopefull st meanes I had of this ambition; &amp; by her, I, awhile promised myself, some healp. But (after I came to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstanding) I preceaved, her over-ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Flights</hi> into the world, had (in her prime growth) so spent those tymes of opportunity whereby she should have enabled her self, for brave Attempts; that shee could never be strong enough, to make wing halfe so high as my <hi>Desires.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Yet, by your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">ties</seg>
      </hi> royall <hi>Father,</hi> of blessed Memorie (who, a litle before his death, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to honour mee with his gratious respect) I was commanded to perfect a <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which he vnderstood I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunn; &amp; by his encouragment, I finished the same about the tyme of his <hi>Translation</hi> to a better Kingdome. Wherein, God soe enabled mee, that many have well approoved thereof; and, I, latelie resolving to make it publike (wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other Testimonie of my thanckfulnes) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it would be no dishonour to your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">tie</seg>
      </hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
if before the same, I convayed your beloved <hi>Name</hi> to that Nation, who so dearlie affect you.</p>
   <p>But, when I had well considered thereon I thought it would be a very pertinent comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so to doe. For, they were <hi>Afflictions</hi> or <hi>Deliverances</hi> from <hi>Afflictions,</hi> which were occasions of every <hi>Psalme:</hi> Therfore, none but they who have bene afflicted, cann relish the sweetnes, or vnderstand, the depth of these <hi>Raptures;</hi> And therfore also, they who come nearest in their Christian suffrings to those whome they personated, shall best feel, &amp; vnderstand their meaning. In which (if I be not more a stranger to your <hi>Highnesse,</hi> then I thinck I am) you have bene honored aboue all the kings &amp; princes of the world: &amp;, in my opinion you have had more occasion to make personall Application of these <hi>Hymnes</hi> vnto your selfe, then any of them.</p>
   <p>And, there is no shame <hi>(most excellent Princesse)</hi> in the <hi>Crosse</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> For, the highest honor cōsisteth not in wearing a <hi>crown;</hi> but, in a Crowne that hath many <hi>Thornes</hi> in it; &amp; the more <hi>Thornes</hi> the more honorable. Though the sonns of men, do skoffingly turne this <hi>glory into shame, &amp; seek after Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
yet, they who shall sitt nearest unto <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> must drinck deepest of his <hi>Cupp:</hi> And, your <hi>Highnes</hi> hath (in my Observation) more largly, pledged him, then many other. For, in all these <hi>Hymns</hi> (all which, are prophecies of such things as pertaine to <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Mysticall body)</hi> there are fewe passages, communicable to his <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> but (even in my owne knowledge) your <hi>Ma.</hi> may apply them vnto your self, as a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on him. And, God let mee not live, if I do not thinck, that more honours you, then to be <hi>Empresse</hi> of the world.</p>
   <p>And, because it is the greatest honour to come so near, both to the <hi>Type</hi> &amp; the <hi>Prototype,</hi> of our suffrings, as your <hi>Ma.</hi> hath done; &amp;, <hi>to beare so many marks of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Because also, some skoffing <hi>Ismaelites</hi> have mentioned these <hi>Glories</hi> to your <hi>Dishonour;</hi> I wil to your Praise, repeat some few, out of those many which are appliable to your <hi>Ma.</hi> &amp;, they shal be such, that most will confesse, they are the very same Afflictions, whereof (as a type of <hi>Christ)</hi> king <hi>David</hi> complained.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>He, was exalted by</hi> God; <hi>&amp;, yet, cast downe. He was annonited</hi> king, <hi>&amp; yet enioyed not the</hi> Kingdome. <hi>He was driven
<pb facs="5"/>
from his owne possessions, &amp; compelled to soiourne in a forraigne Land.</hi> Kings <hi>&amp;</hi> Rulers, <hi>were confederated against him. He, was remooved from his</hi> Kindred; <hi>&amp; his</hi> Acquaintance <hi>were sett far off. His enimies were powrefull, &amp; too strong for him. His adversaries were multiplied:</hi> Yea, <hi>they insulted over his calamities;</hi> &amp; many judged his cause so bad, that they pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him <hi>forsaken of God. The</hi> proud, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged lies against him. False witnesses layd things to his Charge which he knew not.</hi> Princes, <hi>sate &amp; spake against him.</hi> The <hi>mighty, persecuted him without a Cause. They had almost consumed him vpon earth. They waited to destroy him. The</hi> Bands <hi>of the wicked robbed him. They spake of peace vnto him when they purposd warr. Trouble, &amp; anguish, tooke holde vpon him: &amp;, he was persecuted, when God had smitten him. The Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly reioiced in his Adversity; &amp; cryed</hi> There, there, so wee would have it. <hi>He was reproched of his Neighbours. He was the scorne of fooles. The Drunckerds made songs of him. They said he was cast downe, &amp; should never rise againe:</hi> And
<pb facs="5"/>
many other suchlike passages, there are, which my memory confusedly retaines. In all which, (together with your <hi>Roiall Consort,)</hi> you have heene a partaker, in such measure, as Christians of inferior <hi>Degree,</hi> cannot commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in the like Suffrings, in the same sense.</p>
   <p>Nor are these things, only, Appliable vnto your <hi>Highnesse</hi> in an extraordinary manner; But all those <hi>consolations, Hopes, Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> promises of <hi>Mercye, Favours</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, Resolutions of <hi>Praise, &amp; Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> with others of this nature, throughout the <hi>Psalms;</hi> are in a singuler manner, pertinēt also to you: &amp; (no doubt) so applied, by your <hi>Ma:</hi> in your owne hart, as occasion is offred.</p>
   <p>Which, when I had considered (for, your <hi>Highnes,</hi> as a glorious Member of <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> is often in my serious &amp; retired thoughts) And, I, remenbring also, that, long since, I vowed a Pilgrimage to your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">tie</seg>
      </hi> (so soone as I could be furnished with some <hi>Presēt)</hi> I thought this my endevour would not be impertinētly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented: therefore, I thus prepared the same; &amp;, am now come, to accomplish my <hi>Vowe.</hi> Which I humbly desire, may be acceptable to your <hi>Ma.<seg rend="sup">tie</seg>
      </hi> I doubt not, but you often peruse this <hi>Booke</hi> in other <hi>Translations.</hi> Yet, these <hi>Meditations,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
may, perhaps, occasion (either now, or hereafter) some vse or application of them, to your extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary comfort. Howsoever; It is, in my owne esteeme, the best <hi>Iewel,</hi> that I have: and, if it were answerable to my humble Affections, it would be the richest that ever was presented to a <hi>Princesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But, lest my over-long <hi>Epistle</hi> become te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, I will <hi>thinck,</hi> by my selfe, what, I have more to <hi>Say;</hi> cravinge pardon for thus presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge, vpon my hopes of your Acceptation; and, for my conceiving it possible, that (after so many yeares) the memory of his <hi>Name</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with your <hi>Highnesse;</hi> who hath, in all this time, produced vnto your veiwe, no Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he retaines any Memoriall of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifits, which he long agoe receaved, by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I distrust not, the obtaining of that which I desire; for, my hart tells mee I am thanckfull; Some live, who have heard mee professe it; God, it witnesse of it, every time I come vnto him for my owne Soul; And I am, in all that I am.</p>
