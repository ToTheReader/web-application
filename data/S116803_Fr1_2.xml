   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL IOHN POVVLET Esquire, my <hi>very Honourable good Patron, and</hi> to the truely Religious, and right <hi>vertuous</hi> ELIZABETH <hi>his wife,</hi> my much honoured Patronesse, <hi>Grace and Peace bee</hi> multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthies, loe to you at last; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Antichrist in such linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as that <hi>Apelles</hi> his pencell, or coale rather was pleased to shadow him in. Lusted I say not, vnuailed onely, and made more barefaced, to yeeld his vgly visage to view of Gods people. How vexeth it to see <hi>Israel</hi> still <hi>halting twixt the two opinions?</hi> After de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing the Idoll so long fore done, a fresh <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Baal?</hi> Were it not hee seemes in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, neere his abolition, I should suspect some boding of his new erection. <hi>Auertat omen Deus. How much better had it beene neuer to haue knowne,
<pb facs="3"/>then knowing to turne backe from the holy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The latter end of such men, will prooue worse then their beginning.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I promise, and perswade my selfe better things of you, and such as accompany saluation: so hereditary seemes right Religion to your Honourable family; hauing continued therein, descents more then <hi>Paul</hi> mentions of <hi>Timothie.</hi> If to your establishment in the present trueth, and furtherance of Faith, in times so wauering, this poore paines may be auaile-some, I haue my desire: and shall thinke (thorough your fauourable acception) some small part of my great debt of thankefull obseruance, wherein I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my selfe to stand obliged to you, and yours, tolerably at least, discharged. <hi>Faxit Deus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Withall you haue such as this Scripture afforded, doctrinall conclusions many for information of iudgement: exhortations frequent, to excite lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing affections; comforts not a few, for support of the trembling conscience, rules to examine our Spirituall estate; characters of gracious vertues; directions for morall practise. In the close, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to the loue and study of peace, more largely pressed, perhaps of purpose, to worke towards vnion <hi>the diuisions of Ruhen</hi> occasioned <hi>by great thoughts of heart. Sirs,</hi> said Moses, <hi>yee are brethren; why striue yee? de lana Caprina,</hi> for the breath of the people, so long, so eagerly, till Religion be neglected; Prayers interrupted; Charitie violated; care of Countrey forsaken; Iniquitie growne impudent, so as to dare giue affront to Authoritie. Oh that our Sauiours aduise might preuaile, to keepe our <hi>salt within our selues,</hi> so should we soone <hi>haue peace one with another.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>For your part, worthy Sir, I haue neuer obserued your temper auerse, much lesse abhorrent from tearmes of peace. Desire onely you should aduance aboue the ordinary of peaceable or patient, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Pacificus;</hi> a peace-maker in Israel. The worke were more then generous; truely Honourable; no lesse then Princely. The stile such haue, in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours language, is no lesse then <hi>Sonnes of God; Hoc a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.</hi> And the God of peace shall be with vs.</p>
   <p>Now for the great kindnesse wherewith you haue refreshed my bowels, I must pray as beggers; the Lord reward it you. As <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Onesiphorus, the Lord grant you, and yours, to finde mercy with the Lord at that day.</hi> I rest</p>
