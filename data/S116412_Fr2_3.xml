   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN, according to my promise, I haue set foorth this <hi>Second parte of Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> which I wish may prooue worthie your Fauour and kinde Estimation, the Anckors whereon my Hopes depende; and though it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue not so much, yet let my good meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with purchase the same. If you finde any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, passe them ouer with a carelesse res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and if ought please your Fancie, let it ceunteruaile that which is amisse. If neyth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>r well, nor amisse, then I pray rest indifferent: and let your courtesie be greater then my boldnesse; and your Fauour beyond my desert. My intent was to please, but if not, my labours are ill bestowed, and my happe the harder: If I may breede any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the well-minded, or purchase any good opinion of the Well-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to Learning, then I haue the reward I expect.</p>
   <p>One peraduenture will say, the inuention is barren; another, the English is harsh; a third, all is naught. Yet let me answere in mine owne behalfe, that which is lightly discōmended, is not easily amended; and the worke well done, that pleaseth all: and that very harsh, that none liketh. But I submit my selfe to the wise, courteous, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whome I trust will vouchsafe to esteeme fauourably of my good intent: that though I am not able to compare with any: yet I am willing to prooue worthie: and haue taken some paines to procure their good opinion, vnto which I submit my selfe. As for <hi>Momus</hi> mates, that are contented with nothing, yet desire most; I let them passe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardles, whom. I neyther care to please or displease: but if my fortune be so aduerse, that I cannot procure their delight I would, then I plead penitencie: protesting I was in good hope of their fauor. Knowing this, that which disagrees with ones fancie, may delight anothers.</p>
   <p>So that I am in hope this poore Treatise may passe, with the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

opinion of some, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>gh not of all yet especially of the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: That I st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>l rest in hope. I shall not be frustrated in all my expectation, but reape your courtous Censure, for my good mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
