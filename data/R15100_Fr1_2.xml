   <head>Advertisement OF THE PUBLISHER.</head>
   <p>I Find by some discourse I lately had with the Author, that his design in drawing up his Memoirs, being to set down what had occurr'd to him of his own Observation and Experiments, he purposely forbore to consult the Authors that have professedly written upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Waters, he would by no means have it thought, that he undervalued those Learned Writers that he forb<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e to cite, because he had them not at hand, as well as because his design did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire he should transcribe from them. And therefore he desires, that his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders should not be kept, by any thing he has written, from consulting other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that have treated of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="3"/>
especially the late Ingenious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of the Learned Doctor <hi>Lister De Fontibus Medicatis Angliae</hi> (after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Author,) and the curious little Tract of the <hi>French</hi> Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that was brought our Author in <hi>English,</hi> after his Memoirs were come to him from the Press, publish'd by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi of the famous Royal Academy, of Sciences at <hi>Paris,</hi> especially where they curiosly examine the Saline and earthly. Residences of Waters, which our Author has not done to the remains of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Acidulae,</hi> of which Liquors he had for the most part such incompetent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities as concurr'd with another reason to discourag'd him from publishing his Tryals on them. Yet I may safely say what he offers here to the Reader is far beyond any thing that has been publish'd in this kind; for the Virtuosi as well as the Water-drinkers may reap no small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the perusal of this learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as containing a great number both of useful Observations, and unusual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>
