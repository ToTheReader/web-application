      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume be little, and the leaues but fewe, I here offer, either to expresse the
<pb facs="2"/>dutie I owe, or to vnfolde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie project worthy your iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious eye and censure: yet for that the subiect in some sort is sutable to your place, and calling, Pardon me in your patience, if I craue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. The booke <hi>Iohn</hi> took from the Angels hand, was but a little one, yet was it passionate in the eating, sweet in the mouth, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the bellie; voyces, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, &amp; thunderings went with it, and a powerfull speech bound with a sacred oath, that <hi>Time</hi> should be no more; The vision was
<pb facs="2"/>for an appointed time, and now is the time. For iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at our doores, and that which deuoureth all, with mortalitie, is euē now ready to be swallowed vp it self with Aeternitie, for time shall bee no more: <hi>Est dies, &amp; Deus vltionis;</hi> There is a day, and a God of reuenge. A day of doome, and a God of Iudgement; A day of death, and a day of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from death &amp; doome. <hi>Inde venturus,</hi> shall ende all time in this world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne Eternitie in a better; when all iudgement shalbe
<pb facs="3"/>deuolued into the hands of Christ, whose fanne is in his handes, now readie to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe the Chaffe from the Wheate, with an eternall doome of Life for the one, and of Death for the other. Spare mee to speake of that great Day, and when I haue done, pardon my boldnesse, if I presse it as a president for Iudges of the Earth to iudge, and to be iudged by: next vnder God &amp; the King, you doe worthilie possesse one of the greatest Circuits of Iustice within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; &amp; with what feare
<pb facs="3"/>of God, loyaltie to your Prince, loue of the subiect, and integritie towardes all, I appeale to the conscience of those Countries, where it is both dulie seene, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie felte; I say felt, in the sweet temper of mercie and iudgement, euer cancelling the rigour of the Law, with the mildnes of the Gospell, and beating backe the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Iordan,</hi> that runneth roughly, with the sweet rū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waters of <hi>Sylo,</hi> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth softly by <hi>Syon:</hi> Til I leaue to liue, I shall neuer forget your religious care at <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>ouer the dead, (I meane the poor condemned priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then ready to die by the doome of <hi>Iustice</hi>) how they might be wrought willing to leaue this miserable <hi>world,</hi> and be prepared for a better.</p>
   <p>And finding in your right iudgements, (being rightlie resolued) that it could neuer be but vpō the sight of their sinnes, and feeling of their Sauiour; your holie resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, they should bee brought to publique praier, and Preaching, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, the day before their <hi>executiō,</hi> wher honored with
<pb facs="4"/>your presence, &amp; sanctified with your Prayers, <hi>w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> much sweet Baulme of that great congregation, powred vpon their heades, to burie them withall: It was strange to see, how <hi>Dauids</hi> harp abated <hi>Saules</hi> rage: I meane how that heauēly harmony quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the desperate, confessing their sinnes, and longing for the houre of their dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with desire to be loosed, and to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> there to walke, in the land of the liuing. They mooued your L: yet further, that this their Faith might bee confirmed,
<pb facs="5"/>and sealed vp, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Christ</hi> his blessed death &amp; passion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted by you, &amp; cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by vs, a little before their going to Execution, I appeale to the Sheriffe of the Countrie, and at least to a thousand lookers on, how cheerfullie they died, seuen vpon the tree, and one at the stake: truly confessing their sinnes to God, in the sight of men and Angells, with an assured hope of pardon, in, and through the bloudshed of <hi>Christ,</hi> their alone sauiour, &amp; redeemer; not doubting,
<pb facs="5"/>but vpon the dissolution, as their body must to the earth from whence they came, so their soules should immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately passe to God, that gaue them, there to be tyed, as in the bundle of the liuing.</p>
   <p>It were to be wished this memorable acte of yours, might be cōtinued &amp; made exēplarie, to the rest of your Ranke, in their seuerall Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, you may take &amp; leaue, as you see occasion; Yet if you please, after iudgement whilst they yet liue, to lappe your dead in such <hi>Syndon,</hi> it wil be honorable to you, as
<pb facs="6"/>it was to <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> when they for the Head, &amp; you for the members, are so charitablie deuoted: sith he that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, &amp; they that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are both one.</p>
   <p>It was vsuall with the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians,</hi> in their solēne feasts, to drinke the last draught in a dead mans skull: thereby, in the height of their solace, to put them in mind of their mortalitie: I haue said, <hi>Ye are Gods,</hi> that's your prayse: yet <hi>must ye die like men,</hi> that's your check. It will not be amisse therefore, as you slide from
<pb facs="6"/>your thrones of Honour, to look vpon the dust of those yee haue condemned, &amp; to tender the saluation of those poore soules, whose bodyes you haue rēdred vnto death, not doubting <hi>Quin patibulo ad Polum patent jis aditus:</hi> I meane to all such as shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme a bad life, with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent death: and say, in the patience of their soules, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the tree whereon righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes hangeth, wee are iustly punished, &amp; haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but hee that saueth vs, hath done nothing amisse.</p>
   <p>To this GOD and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb facs="7"/>I leaue you both, with all your religious endeuors, pressing your affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee, no further, but as in dutie and true deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall merit the same.</p>
