   <head>AN INDVCTION TO THE three bookes follovvinge.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L Christian diuinitie (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,) that is, all the busines that man hath withe God in this lyfe standethe in two poyntes. The one to knowe: the other to doe. This first parte containeth <note place="margin">Tvvo partes of Christiā diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> principally our beleefe, set forth to vs in our Creede, and other declarations abowt our faith, deliuered vs by the Catholique chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to know and beleeue onlie. The other parte containethe the ten cōmaundementes, the vses of holye Sacramentes, and the like, prescribed vnto Christians not onlye to kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we or beleeue, but allso to exercise and execute in this lyfe. The first of thes two partes is called theorike or speculatyue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> it consisteth in speculation, that is, in vnderstandinge and discourse of the minde, wherby a man comprehendeth the thinges he hath to knowe and beleeue. The second parte is called practique or actiue, because it <note place="margin">Practike.</note> standeth not onlye in knowledge, but also in action and execution of those thinges whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by the first parte he hath conceaued and vnderstoode.</p>
   <p>In the first parte there is lesse labour and <note place="margin">Actiue diuinitie harder thē spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue.</note> difficultie a greate deale than in the seconde. Because it is easier to know, then to doe: to beleeue aright, then to lyue accordinglie: and the thinges that a man hathe to beleeue are
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
muche fewer, than the thinges he hathe to doe, and therfore Christ in the Ghospels, and the Apoostles in their writinges, spake muche more of thinges to be donne, than of thinges to be knowen: of good lyuinge, than of right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> And amongest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians few are damned for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which commonlye all men baptised haue sufficient: (except in tymes of heresies,) but many thowsandes for euill life dailye. VVherfore Christ in the Ghospell tellinge the reason of suche as shoulde be damned, putteth lacke of good lyfe, as the reason of their damnation. <hi>Departe from me (saieth he</hi>) <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note>
      <hi>into euerlastinge fire: I vvas Hungrie and you gaue me not to eate, et ce.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And the reason of this is, for that the thinges which a man is bounde to beleeue (as I saide before) are fewe, in respect of the thinges whiche a man hathe to doe, or the vices that he hath to auoyed. Againe, the <note place="margin">The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō more hurte thāe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge by the fall of Adam.</note> partes in man whiche appertaine to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge and knowledge, were not so hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te by the fall of Adam, as the partes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayninge to action, whereby it commeth, that a man hath lesse difficultie, payne, and resistance in hym selfe to knowledge, than to good lyfe, where our owne corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions make warre against vs, and so doe make the matter vnpleasant for a tyme, vntill they be conquered. For whiche cause we see manie greate lerned men not to be the best lyuers, for that to know muche is a pleasure to thē, but to doe muche is a payne.</p>
   <pb n="8" facs="11"/>
   <p>For thes causes, not onlye the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res (as I noted before) but allso the auncient holye fathers, haue made greate and longe discourses, ample volumes, &amp; manye bookes, about this second parte of Christian diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche consisteth in action, owt of whose worckes, thes three bookes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge for the most parte are gathered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taininge a perfect and exact instruction or direction, for all thē that meane to leade a trew Christian life, as also diuers helpes for them which haue not yet fullye that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For what so euer is necessarie to a Christian after he hathe once receaued the faithe, is contained in this worcke. And to <note place="margin">Three thinges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a Christiā in this lyfe.</note> speake in particuler, three thinges are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. The first is a firme resolution to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue God for the time to come, and to leaue vice. The second is how to begynne to doe this. The third is how to perseuer and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new vnto the ende.</p>
   <p>These three thinges whoe so euer hath, no doubt but he shall bothe lyue and dye a good Christian, and enioye euerlastinge life in the world to come. And for lacke of all or some one of thes thinges, manie thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes (the more is the pittie) doe perishe daylie. For some men are ether so carelesse, or so carnallie geeuen, as they neuer resolue them selues to lyue in deed well, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake wickednes: and thes are farof from the state of saluation. Other resolue them selues often, but they neuer beginne, or a least way they beginne not as they shoulde
<pb n="9" facs="11"/>
doe, wherby they neuer come to any perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Other doe both resolue and begyn well, but they perseuer not vnto the ende, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> for lacke of instruction, or helpes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to the same: and thes also can not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to lyfe euerlastinge, but rather doe leese their labour, for that Christ hath not <note place="margin">Mat. 10 &amp; 24.</note> promised saluation, but onlie to such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer to the ende.</p>
   <p>For helpinge therfore Christians in thes <note place="margin">The diui siō of this vvorcke.</note> three poyntes, this worcke is deuided into three bookes. In the first booke there are shewed manye meanes and helpes, wherby <note place="margin">The first booke.</note> to bringe a man to this necessarie resolution, of leauinge vanities to serue God, with a Christian lyfe, accordinge to his profession. In the second booke is declared in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> how a man shall begin to putt this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in practise, and without errour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn a new trade of lyfe. In the third booke <note place="margin">The third booke.</note> are layed downe, the meanes and helpes to perseuerāce vnto the ende. The which bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge done, there remaineth nothinge, but the reapinge of glorie in the lyfe to come, which we shalbe able to doe without instructions, yf it be our good happe to come to it, which God graunte, and send vs his grace, that we mave be as well cōtent to labour for it in this lyfe, as we will be ioyfull to possesse it in the next, and to auoyde the dreadfull tormentes, vvhich those must needes fall into, vvho for flovvth, pleasure, or negligence, omitt in this vvorlde, to procure the kyngdome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for godes seruantes, in the next.</p>
