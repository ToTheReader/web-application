<pb facs="3"/>forwardnes to respect me, before I had time to deserve of you. The thing I aimed at in them, was to make the Storie they belong to, as orderly, as it is perfect: so that if they have no other use, they may stand in stead of an harmony to right any doubt about our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours sufferings. As for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I desired to stirre up in my selfe and others by them, it could not bee bestowed upon a better subject: howbeit, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the best I have fail'd, or my affections want heate of zeale; I hope nevertheles, that my sparke may kindle a greater fire, where it findes sewell, by the light of which, many may both see, and bee warmed. And now I have brought my worke to the fire, you may doe to it as you please; for I put it into your hands, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="4"/>pardon for my boldnes, and so ending, with my daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for your daily encrease in all things that may make you an happie Governour of the Society you are in, or may rise to.</p>
