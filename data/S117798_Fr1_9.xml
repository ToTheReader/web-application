      <l>That was as full of wonder as of
Glory,</l>
      <l>But tooke the Angels Hymne, and

to men.</l>
      <l>Nor when three Kings did to her
Cratch resort,</l>
      <l>Did shee conceive her Stable

The pretious Myrrhe, and odrous

      <l>Thou hast not power t'unfold

      <l>Divinity is from all passion free,</l>

Wherefore thy Virgin Mother here

      <l>And here I crave no pardon, if
