   <head>TO THE MOST CELEBRIOVS and famous Vniuersity of Cambridge.</head>
   <p>Ingenious and learned <hi>Academians,</hi> I do not present this my small about vnto you, intreating hereby your patronage thereof. For how can I expect so greate a fauour since most of you dissent from me in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is here mantayned: neither as houlding this poore worke, for any art therein, worthy your iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceons vew. For I am not onely conscious to my self of myne owne weaknes: but do also grearly admyre your pearcing and cleare eyed indgmentes.</p>
   <p>To you then I exhibite it, as appealing to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (such is my confidence in your impartiall and euen censures) as Iudg betwene her sonne and my self. For wheareas my designed aduersary at this present M. Whyte, (to whom your vniuersity haith first geuen his education for literature, and since hath graced him with the inuesture of Doctorship) in answear to a Catholic Treatise (first pēned by one of my fellow-labourers in the vineyard of Christ) haith written a most virulent and scandalous booke, entituling it, <hi>The way to the true Church.</hi> The which booke was fownde so full of corruptions, vntruthes, and other such baisse matter, that it was houlden in the opinion of many great and learned Preistes, rather worthy of contempt then answear.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse M. Whyte, not onely in the Preface of this said booke, but also in diuers places of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond worke, vaunteth much of his sincere dealing in the first, as particulerly pag. 129. where saying that it is the profession of Iesuites in their wryting, <hi>to rayde bookes, counterfeat, forge, and lye:</hi> he then thus ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb facs="3"/>
concludeth. <hi>My aduersary can not present the Reader with one conclusion</hi> (meaning of his first book) <hi>one doctrine, one quotation, one lyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> on letter, to make him really see wherein I haue fayled.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now this idle venditation of ingenuity and vpright dealing, haith awakened my sleeping pen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede haith geuen birth to this short Treatise, whear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I do vndertake to make good our former censures, that is, to demonstrate, that the very ground and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his first booke, is mere corruptions, vntruthes, and other such impostures, in the euicting of which poynt I am so secure, that I willingly make your selues Iudges both of him and me, being assured, that in a true and serious perusall of this my accusatiō, you shall synde no ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dor in Whyte, nor any of Gods spirit in him who styleth him self Gods minister, but rather in reguard of your frustrated hope, you shall haue iust reason to say of this childe (who seming Iacob, proueth Esau) <hi>Expectauimus lucem, ecce tenebra. Es.</hi> 59. which deformities of his, I am not of so rigide a Iudgement, as to ascribe to your famous vniuersity, for at this present, I do not wholly approue that comō position of the Ciuilians, <hi>partus sequitur ventrem</hi>: And we all obserue, that those faire heauenly bodies, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring forth monsters.</p>
   <p>It is certainly reported, that desyre of praise (a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>teor</hi> ingendred in the Region of self conceate) first inuyted M. Whyte, to support forsooth, with his learned hand, the threatning and falling piller of his new Church: and thereupon he instantly stept into the number of writers, hauing thereby already gayned great applause and approbation from the wauering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine multitude, in whose weake opinion, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue ouerpassed most of his tyme and ranck: but I doubt not, but by the assistance of him, who <hi>In
<pb facs="3"/>
veritate educet iudicium, Es.</hi> 42. and by the ensuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of his calumnious forgeries, so to picke the swolne bladder of his pryde, as that all his frothy os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, shall resolue to nothing: and that his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges (lyke vnto new found wells, being commonly of acompt onely for a yere or two) which heretofore his fauorites haue so highly estemed: shall for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remaine contemned and neglected: which euent may well be expected since it often hapneth, that he <hi>who ryseth sodainly, faleth precipitatly.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But as in this following Treatise you shall be fully satisfyed of the want of his sincerity, so here I hould it not inconuenient, to geue some touch of that oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious tongue of his, which casteth most fowle and vndeserued aspersions of contumely and reproch vpon all Preistes and Catholickes. For euen in his Epistles of this his booke impugned by me, he wryteth, that the, <hi>Iesuites are the Popes Ianisaryes, that Priests are cunning seducers possessing mens wyues, &amp;c. vsing their goods to swager, and serue their owne luxurious vse, &amp; that since the Harpies were chaced away, and Bet was ouerthrowne, neuer was such a greedy and rauenous Idol as the seminary, and that friars, seminaryes, and Masse Priests, are so many beares and bloody, the Tigars, the fatall enemyes of Princes, &amp;c. that the Papists laity, doth liue in extreame ignorance, and finally that their religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pay no depts, murther Kings, and tendeth cheifly to all bloody conspiracies, &amp;.</hi> Our innocency in all which pointes, one daye will discouer, when the valye of each mans actions shalbe drawne awaye, and when all deedes and thoughts shalbe plainly laid open, at what time M. Whyte, for theese and other his most false, iniurious, and vnchristian reproches must render a seuere account; only at this present our retaliation to him shalbe to saye with the <hi>Apostle</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note>
      <hi>maledicimur
<pb facs="4"/>
sed benedicimus, blasphemamur sed obsecramus</hi> and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that by these his <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ppickes</hi> and declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory inuectiues, he haith worthily gotten the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being counted a good rayler, and hath bene carefull (as it should seeme) to warrant in him self those wordes of the Scripture:<note n="d" place="margin">Iac. 3.</note>
      <hi>the touge is an vnruly euill, full of deadly poyson.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And now <hi>illustrious Academians</hi> (whome God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with transcendent spiritts, and vnderstandings farr aboue the vulgar) suffer me, before I remit you to this following discourse to present vnto you touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Catholicke faith, these few admonitions, the which you are not to contemne, as proceeding from me how meane soeuer, but rather herein to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that from the earth (the lowest element of all) we best obserue the motions of the heauens.</p>
   <p>Make then particuler triall of the cheefe grounds of our Catholicke religion, and looke backe vnto the Continuall practize of Christes Church since it first beinge, &amp; assure your self, that we shall not be found superstitious and blynd (as it pleaseth M. Whyre &amp; others to terme vs) for how can they be blind, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould the articles of there faith with the eyes of all antiquity.</p>
   <p>Examine it by the rules of Gods sacred word, &amp; for the true sence of his written word (as following e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the iugments of the most dispassionat and sobe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
