The Authors of this medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>e, fearing that if they should haue filled vp their speeches with copious words, to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry satisfying, through it mellow ripenesse, it would haue died at the first reuealing, as many other more worthy and better approoued things haue done. Auoiding also by continuall processe all tediousnesse, thorough which they should haue bin combersome to themselues, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in like manner others with an entire thing, haue therfore taken the way, brieflie to cut off all copious speaking, least the matter should haue proceeded more infinitely, thē either their leasure or the matter required: contenting one another with the bare sence of things, on purpose to continue life in the matter, knowing it notwithstanding to be subiect to withering as all other things are. Abhorring besides, as it should seeme to argue any thing to a triall through painted guile or supportation of Arte. Now howsoeuer the matter frameth, I may hope not to purchase the grudge or enuie of any, medling not at all therein farther then may beseeme the vprightnesse of a reporter: yet therein also as becommeth me, intreate the readers especially Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the better sort, in whom there is alwaies to be found huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and moderation, not to enterpret things to the worst, but rather to pardon falts which all men are subiect vnto: to whom I commit the correction of my selfe, so far as I haue offended, if they may please to vouchsafe the paines, knowing that they will at the least allow me as great a libertie to confesse my owne ignorance, as to iustifie other mens knowledges. Now for the enuious and ignorant, I desire to haue it taken of them as a tale told to deafe men, but to the wise and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, I hope it may prooue a song sung in a wood, that had a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table eccho. For whose sakes also I had thought to haue compassed out this matter with another meate wand, but that the multitude of precepts should haue bin thereby obscured, a fault and hinderance to haue made open and plaine things lesse knowne.</p>
