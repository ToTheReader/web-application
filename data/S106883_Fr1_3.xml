   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, I am preuented in mine own hopes; in seconding thrifts forward desires. Som foure yeres since being at sea with <hi>M. Candish</hi> (whose memorie if I repent not, I lament not) it was my chance in the librarie of the Iesuits in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> to find this historie in the Spanish tong, which as I read delighted me, and delighting me, wonne me, and winning me, made me write it. The place where I began my worke, was a ship, where many souldiers of good reckning finding distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed stomackes; it can not but stand with your discretions to pardon an vndiscreete and vnstaied penne, for hands may vary where stomacks miscary. The time I wrote in, was when I had rather will to get my dinner, then to win my fame. The order I wrote in, was past order, where I rather obserued mens hāds lest they should strike me, then curious reason of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mee. In a worde, I wrote vnder hope rather the fish should eate both me writing, and my paper written, then fame should know me, hope should acquaint her with me, or any but miserie should heare mine ending. For those faults (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) escaped by the Printer, in not being acquainted with my hand, and the booke printed in my absence, I must craue you with fauour to iudge of, and with your wonted curtesies to correct; and according to Ecclesiasticall law, giue vs on our confession absolution: if you will not, remember this, that a countrie lasse for Ladies, may tell them they curle too much; and for Gentlemen, that they are vnfashioned by their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To be short, who liues in this world, let him wincke in the world; for either men prooue too blinde in seeing too litle, or too presumptuous in condemning that they shoulde not.</p>
