   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Trange and wonderfull changes, haue by Gods iust iudgement happened heretofore vnto men, for their horrible and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious crimes, euen in the greatest Empires, Monarchies, and common weales. And like as God, who knoweth how to pull downe the pryde euen of the greatest which abuse their authoritie, hath executed those iudgementes too manifest his iustice: so hath he also set them foorth for example to such as shoulde come after, into whose handes hee woulde put the scepters to rule folke withall: to the intent they might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that as they report them selues to reigne by his grace, so in very deede they be his Lieuetenantes, &amp; Ministers of his iustice vpon earth, and therfore ought not to abuse that soueraigne and welneere diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, wherewith he hath inhonored them.</p>
   <p>Also, (which thing hath not come to passe without Gods prouidence) there haue euer bin learned men of rare wittes, whiche haue
<pb facs="3"/>
conueyed the remembrance of suche chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ouer to posteritie, to serue them for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: leauing in writing the causes of such chaunces, with their effectes and diuersities of falling out, to the ende that whensoeuer the like turnings come againe, men may bee in a readines to take the counsel which may be most for their welfare, or at leastwise w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> may bee least hurtfull to their Countreys &amp; to their owne personnes. Thucydides the prince of Historiographers among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, affirmeth that his taking vpō him to write the ciuill wars among the Greekes, called the warres of Peloponnesus, whiche were full of diuers chaunges: was for the example of them that were to come after him, when they lighted into warres of the like kinde. And of a trueth, wise men whiche haue aduisedly examined the causes of the ciuill warres, as well which haue been in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ages past, as which haue bin in our age: haue founde many thinges resembling the saide warres of Peloponnesus, whither it be in the causes and the effectes, in difficulties of resolution, in differences of dispositions, in lettes of execution, in treasons, trecheries, surmizes, misreportes, or slaunders agaynste good men, and in such other like incidentes. The like also is to bee seene in other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers:
<pb facs="3"/>
For the more precisely &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they haue written, the more haue they done vs to vnderstande, that this saying of the Orator is true, <hi>That an Historie is the Scholemistresse of mans life.</hi> And soothly if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any change in the world were notable &amp; worthie to bee imparted to posteritie▪ it is that which hath hapned in these Low coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. For whither ye haue an eye to the farre differing qualities of the two princes that entered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> into these warres: or to the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of their forces: to the diuersitie of the causes which mooued them to enter into armes on either part: to the diuersity of their successe, on the one part with secret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises sagely demeaned, and on the other part with wiles, deceites &amp; mischeeues prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised: or to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> treaties of peace &amp; vnitie made, double made, and vnmade againe: to the diuersitie of partes whiche some selfe same persons haue followed almost at one time, or finally to the chāge of the prince that had bin followed with long, aduised, &amp; sage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and to the incoūterings that haue bin made to the contrary, &amp; the things that are to ensue therof hereafter: these things (I say) being diligētly examined, will shew how there haue been feawe chaunges heretofore,
<pb facs="4"/>
whiche haue better deserued to come to light, thāthat which we haue presētly before our eyes. Which thing maketh vs to hope, that God will not suffer so goodly and rare an example to bee buried, but that hee will stirre vp some wise, learned, and eloquent man, meet to set it forth in writing, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende it to posteritie. Howebeit forasmuch as it is our duetie to helpe him that shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise so great, so high, and so difficulte a woorke: and one (as it were) of most principall and speciall poyntes, fallen out in the inuesting of the Duchie of Brabande in the person of the Lorde Frauncis, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye brother of the Frenche King, Duke of Aniow: and in his entering into the right renowmed citie of Antwerpe: I thought it my duetie to write downe the same truely now while the remembraunce thereof is yet freshe: as well to giue knowledge thereof to strāge nations, as to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rue his turne w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> notes of remembrance, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shall impart to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the whole and vniuersall change happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this countrey. By the way, I woulde haue all men to vnderstande, that although we haue no cause to repentevs of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the saide Prince, chiefely for that it
<pb facs="4"/>
hath pleased him to like well of it: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the said citie of Antwerpe had not any more then sixe dayes respit, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the entertaynement of so great a prince: to the intent that all men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, after what sort the people were affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which in so short time vndertook so great a matter: and howe great the sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of his entertainement was like to haue bin, if the time might haue bin answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the good will and earnest desire of all the inhabitantes of the noble and riche citie of Antwerpe.</p>
