   <head>TO THE MOST LEARNED VNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITIE MEN, FLORISHING BOTH AT OXFORD AND <hi>Cambridge, Edmond Campian</hi> sendeth greeting.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I returned (most worthy men) into this Iland, a yeere agoe, vpon commandement of my superiours, according to the order of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which I professe; I found stormes farre more dangerous on the English coasts, than those were which I had lately escaped on the Brittaine Ocean. But when I had gone further into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I sawe nothing more vsuall, then vnusuall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nothing more certaine than vncertaine daungers. Then I plucks vp my heart, as well as I could, calling to mind the goodnes of my cause, and not forgetting the troubles of these times. And least peraduenture I should be caught before that any man heard what I had to say; forthwith I writ downe my determination, why I came, what I sought for, what manner of warre, and against whom I purposed to proclaime it. The first draught of my
<pb n="2" facs="22"/>writing, I kept still about me, that if I were apprehended it might be found with me. A copie thereof I left in keeping with a friend of mine, which vnawares trulie to me, was shewed to many other men, and by them coppied out. The Aduersaries tooke the schedule, being published, in ill part, most spitefully reprehending both all the rest, as also this, that I alone in this matter of Religion, had made the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to all. Although in very deed, I alone would not haue entred the list; if with licence of her Maiestie, and safe conduct these disputations had been granted: <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Charke,</hi> haue made answere to my challenge: what I pray you? though it were long before? To no purpose at all, for they shall giue no answere honestly but one, which I feare they will neuer giue, to wit: <hi>We accept of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, The Queenes Maiestie hath giuen her word, that you shall come and goe safe: make haste hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</hi> In the meane while they are full of their exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Fie vpon thy societie, out vpon thy seditions, art thou not ashamed of thine arrogancie, thou art a Traitor, doubtles thou art a Traitor: foolishly said of them: Why do those men, not the vnaduisedst of all the rest, so lauishlie loose their labour and cost of pen inke and paper? But there is of late a little booke very plaine, set forth for these two men to peruse (the former of which for his pleasure and recreation took my said paper in hand, to confute the same: the other more maliciously hudleth vp the whole matter) which so farre forth as was expedient, entreates both of our society, and of these mens iniuries, and of the charge which I haue vndertaken. There remaineth only for me (for as I perceiue, our Bishops prouide scourges, and not Schooles) that I might render an account of my said fact, euidently to shew, and as it were with my finger to point out vnto you
<pb n="3" facs="22"/>the chiefe Chapters and fountaines of the things, that breed in me such confidence. And withall to exhort you, who espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aboue all others haue to do herein, that you will looke vnto this charge, with such carefull diligence, as <hi>Christ, the Church, the Common-wealth,</hi> and the saluation of your owne soules do require at your hands. If I vpon the affiance of my wit, learning, art, reading, or memorie, haue thus challenged the best learned of the Aduersaries, I was in so doing most vain-glorious, and proud aboue measure, for that I considered neither them, nor my self more deeply. But if vpon considerations of the cause, I thought my selfe able enough to proue that this sunne shineth now at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> you must beare with this my feruent zeale, which the honor of Iesus Christ my King, and inuincible truth, haue vrged me vnto.</p>
   <p>Yee know that <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his oration for <hi>Quintius,</hi> when <hi>Roscius</hi> warranted him that he should get the better, if he could proue that it was not possible for a man to trauaile <hi>700.</hi> miles within two daies space, was not only nothing afraid of the force and strength of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Orator <hi>Hortensius,</hi> but also cared nothing for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus, Cotta, Antonius,</hi> or <hi>Crassus,</hi> who were Orators farre more excellent then <hi>Hortensius</hi> was. And were (as he iudged) the principall Orators of his time. There is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a truth in all matters, so apparent and euident, that neither any iugling trickes, or enchaunting words can darken the beames thereof. But that which I intend to proue is much more plaine, then was that supposition of <hi>Roscius:</hi> for if I shall proue this, that there is a heauen, a God, a faith, a Christ, I haue gotten the victorie. Should I not in this cause then be couragious? Truly wel may I be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but ouercome I cannot be: for I depend vpon those
<pb n="4" facs="23"/>Doctors, whom that holy spirit hath instructed, which can neither be deceiued nor ouercome. I beseech you, haue a care of your soules health: of whom I shall obtaine this, I expect the rest assuredly. Let this be your only care and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation: First to giue your selues to earnest prayer, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie to studie also: and yee shall find out the very depth of the matter, and that the Aduersaries are in despaire; and that we being so surely grounded, haue good cause, chearefully and couragiously, to looke and long after these disputations. I am the shorter in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, because that all the Treatise follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appertaineth properly to you.</p>
