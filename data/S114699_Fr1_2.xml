   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT which thou seest here translated, Christiā Reader, is not a whole booke, but taken out of a litle booke, called, <hi>The Iubile of the reformed Churches, with an Examinatiō of the Iubile of the Church of Rome</hi> (written against the greate <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> cellebrated Anno 1625.) dedicated to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Bouillon, and published in the yeare 1627. The same is diuided into three Treatises, whereof this is only the eleuenth chapter of the second Treatise. I confesse the whole worke were verie requisit to be translated, the rather because of another greate <hi>Iubile,</hi> celebrated this present yeare 1627. as well by the English <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as by all others in all the world, with praiers for the extirpation of our Religion, which they call heresie, as also because many others in England begin to looke back to the flesh-pots of this spirituall Egypt, and thinke to reconcile some of the differences betweene Papists and the Church of England, and to make the rest seeme lesse then they are. But sure I am that this chapter is more then I shall haue thanks for of them; and that if I had sent it ouer the Seas, to haue it printed at London, it could neuer haue beene licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there, because of some things, which were like to offend the Bishops: though it may be the Author in writing of it, did neuer so much as thinke of them, but only of the Romanists. I haue indeauoured to translate him faithfully, without adding any thinge to the text. And if then such a worke as this, so needefull and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, so full of learning and delight, written by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, so eminent religious and impartiall, and so well
<pb facs="3"/>approued in all the Churches of France, be forced to seeke corners in England, let it giue thee to vnderstād that there is somwhat in that Hiarchie, which endures no<note n="*" place="margin">Joan. 3 20.</note>
      <hi>light.</hi> Which for my part I should neuer haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after, much lesse helped to discouer, if the noise of theire late Arminian practises, to change Religion, had not beene heard on this side the Seas; and that they who let so many Arminian and Popish bookes &amp; projects passe vnresisted, are euer vigilant to suppresse all that doe but in the least measure crosse theire Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie and Ceremonies, wherein they vse the art of the French Papists, who beeing the Maisters in power, and yet finding themselues vnable to defend theire cause by the Scriptures, labour all they can to keepe theire Adversaries bookes and arguments from the Princes and people; mocking them with the fanaticall zeale, schisme, heresie and innovation: which as it is theire best weapon, as one of theires confessed vnto me, so it makes that many Papists, and some of the more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing sort,<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 58.5.</note> will not hearken to the voice of the charmer, but turne the deafe eare to all arguments; mocke and speake euill of the things they doe not, will not, nor can not know; beeing by such sleights made verie babies, and kept from the proofes, as men keepe knives from infants: wherein suffering them selves to be thus made sheepe, the<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 7.14.</note> wolves devovre them. Soe the Bishops, who are also the Maisters, unable, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, to defend theire cause by the Scriptures (unles it be by shufling and wresting of them, like the Papists) labour all they can to disgrace and suppresse such boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes as discover them, and studie nothing more then to keepe them from the Princes and people; mocking and scorning them with fanaticall zeale, schisme, heresie
<pb facs="3"/>and innovation; calling all such proofes Puritanicall, Brownisticall and Anabaptisticall, though they be not such matter, but only such as are used against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, by the reformed churches of France, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, &amp;c. which yet makes many Protestants, and even some of the more capable and ingenious Spirits, cast them all aside, mocke and speake evill of the things they doe not, will not or can not know; beeing thus with like cunning, kept from the sight of the proofes; and made to stop theire eares to all such <hi>charmings,</hi> beholding many molested, imprisoned and disgraced aboute them; by them that would teach the Dolphin to swim, if he should come into theire seas, so much the Bishops thinke themselues wronged, if the Scriptures or any thinge else be alleadged against them: yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, or those they suppresse, may more truly say with the Church, <hi>All this is come vpon vs, yet haue wee not forgotten thee, nor dealt falsly in thy couenant;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psa. 44.7</note> this they are no more willing to put to triall, no more then the Papists; vnles themselues may be judges; or rule a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in these and Arminian cases, as the Court of Rome did the Councell of Trent in the like: choosing rather to desende theire cause by power and terrour. Wherein yet they do so litle hurt me, who by Gods grace am out of theire reach, liueing in a more refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, that for my owne particular, I finde no neede to publish such works. It is the loue of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that constraines me: for though by reason of my habit, and long abode in these parts, almost all men take me to be a Dutchman; yet doe I not denie but that I was borne in England, of English Parents, and there had my education. All which were nothing, if I were not tied by greater bonds to my Sauiour to
<pb facs="4"/>seeke his <hi>Kingdom, and the righteousnes thereof.</hi> To the which Readers are also equally obliged, and aboue all such as by theire neerenes to Princes haue best meanes to further it. God once giue them and vs all the grace, that denying our selues, our vaine Policies and temporisings, wee may seeke and follow the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus in his Kingdom and ordinances, Amen.</p>
