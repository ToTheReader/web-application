   <head>THE OPINION OF M. KOB PARKĪNSON PRIEST and licenciate in diuinitie touchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge this controuersie vvith M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chpriest: vvhith is vvord for vvord taken out of a letter of his ost the last of May 1602. The vvhich vvas thought vvorthy the relatinge, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he vvas longe since Card. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Confessour and one of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niours and readers in the seminary at Rhemes.</head>
   <div type="assertion">
      <head>In his second assertion to vvars the end he hath these vvordes</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Knovve also by relation of many and am fully persuaded, that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue sustained iniuries by the erection of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipriest, and some Iesuites: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse vnto you vnfainedly, that if you
<pb facs="12"/>had kept your selues, vvithin the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas of your Appeale, and plainely and orderly proposed to the see Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke (vvhere at first although you vvere repelle, yer in the end doubtles, you should haue had audience and iustice) I vvould neuer haue giuen any signe in mistike of your doinges, but rather to the vtermost of my povver, haue furthered it, as iust and lavvefull.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="postscript">
      <head>In his postscript thus he saith.</head>
      <p>YF God spare me health and life: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne dayes together, I vvill vvrite to F. Persons, concerninge many cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes, that I haue heard off his hard dealinge vvith our youthes at Rome, and likevvise off the nevve erection off the Archipriest in England. It vvas thought of longe before F. Persons. began it: and by Gregorie the 13. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and forbidden, as a iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vvhich could not be practised in England. I suppose F. Persons did it vvith good intention, &amp;c. But by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="13"/>and contradiction, he should haue forseen the misehiefe that vvas like to folovve, and sought meanes hovve to preuent it, rather then by force and authority, to beare it out.</p>
      <p>Thus much by the vvay the good old man vvrote vvel. But in his maine discourse against our soueraine lady, he very grosly goeth against the comō opinion and practise of all our learned countrimen. VVhich may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted partly to his lacke of experience, and partly to those his superiours: that commanded him so to doe, as there he confesseth. Some of the same hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour obiect as a great faulte vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse vertuous Priestes and Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Confessours, that they in faire humble sorte deale vvith the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall magistrate, about their ovvne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, and for the manifold eases of sondry others. VVhere nothinge is more euident by the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then that vve may by all honest meanes possible, both helpe our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and do good to all others. And yf
<pb facs="13"/>vve needed in so cleere a case any longer probation; I could by many examples, of the most Auncient, best learned, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantest Christiās, both Martirs and Cōfes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, conuince it to be neither vnhonest nor dishonorable, for Catholikes in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to fly vnto the clemency of them in vvhose hādes they are, and in most seemely humble maner to beseech thē to haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, on such their poore afflicted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, as be ready to spēd their best blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de either to do any of them good in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or for the seruice of their country in generall. But some doe say, bevvare of the coūcel, they meane onely to deceyne you, but vvil do you noe good: vve confesse their honours to surpasse our brethern in vvitt and policy exceedingely, yet hope, by the helpe of God, that ours are of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient discretion to looke to them selues: and their longe tried constancy in prison, doth vvith any indifferent man vvarrant them from all suspition of trachery in the Catholike cause, vntill there be plaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ofe to the contrary. on the other side, are not the hartes of princes in the handes of God? and are not all men inclinable to mercy, vpon true declaration of our innoe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cency? it is thē rather a singular blessinge of God, thē matter of exclamatiō, to haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the fauorable eare of our gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb facs="14"/>that vve may haue the oportunity to purge our selues frō those heinous crimes of attemptinge euill against her maiesties roiall persō, or dealinge vvith forraine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about an inuasiō; of vvhich through the sinister information of our aduersaries, vve haue been heretofor holdē in great ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy. It may be that they vvho are not so vvel able to discharge them selues of such imputatiōs, dislike of this fauour: fearinge lest their by, their plottes be easlier espied and them selues become more odious. But the innocet (vvho is by that meanes like to find more fauour) must acknovvledg him self much bound vnto vnto that venerable Auncient Priest and Cōfessour M. Bluett, yf he haue (as the Apologie reporteth) in some part pacified the vvrath of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Princesse, and of her right honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble councell tovvars the most part of vs, by cleeringe vs from the suspition of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid vvicked attēptes: and yf he could not do as much for some others (it beinge ouer vvell knovven vnto the coūcell, that they had meadled to to much in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) he is not to be clamed, yf he lett the fault lye vvhere it vvas, and leave them to ansvveare for them selues. But I refer it to him him selfe (vven he shall haue leisure) to treate of this subiect more at large.</p>
