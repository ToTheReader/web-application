      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie men doe wonder at the great power and puissaunce of the Turkes: And they thinke it strange, how this nation (being a people most rude and barbarous, and their beginning most base, vile, and ignominious) coulde attaine within the compasse of so few yeares, to the excessiue height of their present greatnes. Which their admiration (as it semeth) proceedeeh onely of ignoraunce: Because they know not the manner nor the meanes, by which they haue so sodenly preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their Conquests. For such as are acquainted with the Histories of the Turkish affaires, and doe aduisedly looke into the order and course of their proceedinges: doe well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the chiefest cause of their sodaine and fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issaunce, hath beene the excellencie of their Martial discipline ioyned with a singular desire and resolution to aduaunce and enlarge both the bounds of their Empire and the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Religion. The which was alwaies accompanied with such notable Policie and prudence, that the singularitie of their vertue and good gouernment, hath made their Armes alwaies fearefull and fortunate, and consequently, hath caused the greatnesse of their estate. And yet, as their vertue hath made them way to their excessiue fortune: so is this one thing worthely to be wondered at: How so rare vertue could be found in so brutish and barbarous a nation, rather then how they could attaine to so great conquests &amp; dominions. Considering therefore both the wonderfull puissance of their Empire: And
<pb facs="4"/>
Conferring it with the basenesse and obscuritie of their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as also with the barbarousnesse of their disposition: To the intent this strange vnion and coniunction of so rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with so notable Barbarisme might be the better discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I supposed it would bee a matter neither vnpleasing nor vnprofitable in some sort to make known that order of Policie Discipline, and gouernment, by which the Turkes haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased so goodly and glorious an Empire: making themselues Lords and masters of a great part of the world: In so much as the furie of their Armes hath not onely by this meanes swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp infinite, and those most mightie nations in the East▪ But the terrour of their name doth euen now make the kings and Princes of the West, with the weake and dismembred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of their kingdomes and estates, to tremble and quake through the feare of their victorious forces. This was hit that first drew me to Collect into English the summe of the Turks Religion: The manners, life, and customes of that people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: The order, fashions, and Maiestie of their Emperours Court, and person: And the manner of their Ciuill policie and Martiall discipline. For by discouering the nature and state of their religion, and their immoderate zeale in affecting it, by shewing their inueterate hatred against Christians &amp; christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, by making knowne their Barbarous customes and most cruell disposition, by obseruing their politique and aduised course of proceedings, in all their affaires both Ciuill and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: we shall easily discerne: That the whole Policie of the Turkish estate both for their religion, life, and customes, as also for their ciuil gouernment and Martiall discipline: And that all their actions Counsailes, studies, labours and endeuours haue beene euer framed and directed, and wholy bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the enlarging and amplifying of their Empire and Religion, with the dayly accesse of new and continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
<pb facs="4"/>
by the ruine and subuersion of all such kingdomes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, estates and professions, as are any way estraunged from them either in name, nation, or religion.</p>
   <p>Seeing then the discouerie of these things doth represent vnto you matter of so good consequence both for pleasure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, and of knowledge for your profit: Let not my honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours (subiected to the diuersitie and vncertantie of your iudgements) be recompenced with vnfriendly acceptaunce. It may be, exception will be taken both against the forme of this worke for the rudenesse of the stile, and against the matter for the imperfection of it: because the one is homlie and nothing curious, and the other doth seeme to promise more in shew and apparaunce, then it doth yeelde in proofe and performaunce. But how so euer it be faultie in the penning, yet for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, it is not without excuse. For though I do now present you onely with one part of that Policie, which the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this Booke doth promise to impart vnto you: Yet seeing the other part is but delayed for a season (some needful respects causing it for a while to be concealed) My hope is that in the meane time, neither the imperfection of the matter shall draw it into reproofe, nor the basenesse of the phrase shall turne it to disgrace. Wherein if the successe be answerable to my hope, and if I finde this my first attempt to bee fortunate, by the friendly acceptation of this discouerie of the Turkes religion: You shal shortly see it seconded with the other part of these discourses: Relating vnto you their manners, life, customes, gouernment, and Discipline, with some other matters of good and necessary obseruation. All which being ioyned in one, will represent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you at full the whole Policie of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and so shall you haue the Title of this Booke made perfect, which till then may seeme to remaine vnperfect.</p>
