      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AN blowing on his Oten pipe a little
homely Musick, and hearing no man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised
his small cunning, began both to
plaie so loude, and so long, that they were
more wery in hearing his musick, then he
in shewing his skill, till at last to claw him
and excuse themselues, they said his pipe was out of tune.
So Gentlemen, because I haue before time rashly recht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
my pitch, &amp; yet your curtesie such as no man haue
accused me, I haue once againe aduentured vpon your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
(but I doubt so farre) as to be rid of my follie, you
will at the least saie as Augustus said to the Grecian, that
gaue him oft times many rude vearses: Thou hadst neede
(quoth he) reward me wel, for I take more paines to read
thy workes, then thou to write them. But yet willing to
abide this quip, because I may counteruaile it with
your former curtesie, I put my selfe to
your patience, and commit you
to the Almightie.
Farewell.</p>
