      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS CAESAR</hi> in hys descryption of Gallia made in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of this work, may seeme dysagreable wyth other Authors, I thought it expediēt for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of thys History, as well to set oute a more ample description of Gallia, as also to declare what sū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Nations haue since Cesars tyme possessed the same. Neuertheles gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell reader, thou shalt not looke for a particuler declaration of the shifting remouing and expulsing of euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kind of people, nor of the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the state of euerye seuerall coūtry in that Region: for that wold ryse to an infinite volume, more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than profitable, &amp; it is more than I were able to performe. But I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to set before thine eies (as briefly and plainly as my slēder knowledge will geue me leaue) the boundes of
<pb facs="5"/>
that noble countrye, with thalterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such states as haue borne chiefe preheminence and souereintye in the same. Fyrst and formest therfore it is to be considered, that in the 693. yere after the building of Rome (as affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Eutropi{us}) which was the .3905 yere since the creation of the worlde, and the eyght and fifteth yere before the byrth of our sauiour Chryst, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Cesar the author of thys worke, (who afterward brought the state of Rome to a monarchie) being created Consull, was sent by the Senate as Lieuetenant General with an army against the Galles inhabiting on the hyther side of the Alpes: whom wyth in ten yeres space he vtterly subdued and brought in peaceable subiection to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romane empier. the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cesse wherof, he setteth forth so plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, sincerely, and purely in theis Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, without eyther affectatiō of vainglorye to himselfe, or suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe the deserued commendation of others: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is to be doubted whether he atcheued hys affayres wyth more
<pb facs="5"/>
felicity and valiantnesse, or reported them with more indifferency &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. And forasmuch as hys entent in thys worke, was only to entreate of the matters of that country which he had in commission to conquer, he suppresseth in his discription of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, not only that part which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes cal Cisalpina bicause it lyeth on the same side of the Alpes that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly and Rome doth, but also y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Narbon, as Coūtries which by comming in subiection to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empier, were nowe rather to be coūted part of Italy thā of Gallia. For the auncient Gallia conteyned not onelye▪ whatsoeuer is included within the mountaine Pirenes, the Ocean, the Rhine and the Alpes: but also extended ouer the Alpes to the riuer Rubicon. And therfore by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diuisiō it was wont to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Gallia Cisalpina &amp; Gallia Trāsalpina. Cisalpina was also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Togata bicause thīhabiters ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of after the maner of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romans wēt in gownes.

of the Lombardes a people of Germany dwellyng somtyme about the middes of the riuer Albis on the westside therof, where as be now the territories of the Byshoprickes of Magdeburg and Halberstade, who in the time of the Emperor Iustine the second, in the yere of our Lord 569. beinge called into Italye by Narses themperors Lieuetenant there, toke possessions of that country and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therin by the space of twoo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fower yeres vnto the yere of our lord 773. at which time Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les kynge of Fraunce surnamed the great, toke Desiderius laste kinge of Lombardes prisoner and annexed his seniory to the dominion of Fraunce. Gallia Trāsalpina wherof this His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye entreateth, hath (according to Ptolomies description) on the west y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Mountaynes Pirenes nowe called Ronnceuall whyche deuyde it frome Spayn, and the west Ocean. On the East it hath partly the Alpes whiche deuide it from Italy, and the Ryuer Rhyne whych parteth it from Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.

On the north it hath the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysh Ocean and on the South it hath a part of the midland Sea called Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusticū. This is now called Fraūce, and it is deuyded into fower partes, Prouince, Aquitaine, Celticke, and Belgycke.

It conteyneth Picardy, Arthoys, Flaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Braband, Holland, Gelderlād, Lorreine. &amp;c. with al the low country bordering vpon the Rhine, and also the Ile of Fraunce whose head citye of Paris standeth vppon the Ryuer Sene, wherof all the whole country of Gallia toke the name. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath alwais bene renowmed, not only for the fertility of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> soile, the tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratenesse of the aire, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all thynges for mens neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and pleasure: but also (and that chieflye for the valiantnesse in armes and practise in Cheualry of thin habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereby they both enlarged the boundes of their territorye, and also darkened the glory and drowned the name of other Realmes that were neybours vnto them: In somuch that the Grekes the chiefe Registerers of worthy actes, called all thinhabiters from the riuer of Danow northward by the name of Celtes or Galles. Of this countrye were those Galles that
<pb facs="8"/>
vnder the first Brenne (who is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue bene a Briton) burned Rome y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> .365. yere after the buildyng therof in the time of the elder Dēnis king of Sicil. Of this countrye were those Galles that vnder the seconde Brenne a hundred and nyne yeares after the foresayde burnyng of Rome slew Ptolomie kyng of Macedonie, &amp; in thassault of Delphos were oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with thunder lightning and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes. Out of thys countrye issewed those Galles whych beynge called to the aide of the kynge of Bithinia (as Trogus reporteth) after they had vā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished hys enemies, parted his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome with him calling the countrye Gallogrece or Galatia, and themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues Gallogrekes or Galatians. Of whō the prowesse was so redowted, that the kinges of the East made not anye warres wherein they hyred not the Galles to serue them: and if they were put from their kingdomes, thei resorted not to anye other than the Galles for succor. And as that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ofspring held the kinges of Asia
<pb facs="8"/>
occupied there: so their mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye in Europe not onelye troubled their neighbours, but also vexed and disquietted euen the victorious Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, vntyll suche time as Iulius Cesar through his greate prowesse &amp; good fortune, brought theym in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the Romane Empyer. Frō the whyche tyme it receiued both the lawes and lāguage of the Romanes and bare their yoke obediently, vntyl the .viii. yere of themperor Honorius whych was the .406. yere after thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chryste, at the whyche tyme the Frenchmen who as then dwelt vpon the Rhine on the further side, being sēt for against one Lucius a Romane president for rauishing a Senators wyfe in the Citye of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, toke the city, and within a while after subdued al Belgicke vnder thē. This was the beginning of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Frēch dominiō in Gallia, which as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by litle &amp; litle came in subiectiō to thē toke y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of Fraūce of thē. For although that mencion be made of them in the liues of diuers Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb facs="9"/>
before, and that from the reigne of Galien, themperours from tyme to time had much a do with them: yet notwithstanding they aspyred not to any souereinty before the said reigne of Honorius. Of the Original of thē are diuers opinions. Some thinke they inhabited the country by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Sala towards the riuers Mene &amp; Rhyne, and that in hope of conquest and desier of spoyle, at suche tyme as thempier began to decline and wax weak, they ioyned vnto them the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and troubled Themperours of the west, by whome they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repressed, to their great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and domage. Strabo placeth their countrrye betwene the Norikes and Uindelicians. Othersome affirme thē to haue bene a multitude of al sortes of people of Germanye vnited in leage togither, defending their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Empier, whereof they tooke their name, as frank and free people that wold not be bond or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any mā. But whatsoeuer they were, or wheresoeuer theyr dwelling
<pb facs="9"/>
was before they came ouer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Rhine, sure it is that since they passed into Gallia, they haue with greate good fortune encreased, aud pollitiquelye maintained their state vnto this day. For after they had laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theyr kingdome at Triers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pharamund, first ouermatchyng the Almanes their late fellowes and confederates, and anon after subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Burgonions who somewhat before them entring into Gallia had seised into theyr possession the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes of the Heduans and Sequans wyth a part of the auncient Romane Prouince, whych kepeth their name &amp; progenie vnto thys day, they made them selues Lordes of all Gallia. In processe of time also theyr kinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came lords of al Germany &amp; Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and were inuested wyth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sword of the Empier, whiche they held cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine discents frō Charles the great, who receyued the title and diademe imperiall at Rome vpon Christmas day in the yere of our Lord God. 800 But worldly things neuer continue
<pb facs="10"/>
at one stay. Partly by ciuil dissentiō, and partlye by outwarde warre, and partly by composiciō and gyft of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not onelye the name and title of Thempier, but also al the Prouinces beyond the Rhine, yea and manye on this syde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Rhine to, were sequestred from the crowne of Fraunce. For in the time of Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>es the simple about the yeare of our Lord .886. the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes (who are supposed to haue bene people eyther of Denmarke or of Norwey) inuadinge Fraunce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theyr Duke Rollo, (who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde beynge christened was named Robert) partly by force and partly by composition seised into their possessiō that part of the Realme which vnto thys day beareth of theym the name of Normandy: In the which country the posteritye of the saide Rollo reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as Dukes a longe discent, vntill Duke Willyam surnamed the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llard conqueryng this Realme in the yere of Christes incarnation .1967. brought his ryghte wyth hym into England, with the Princes whereof
<pb facs="10"/>
it continued vntill suche time as the Frenchmen recouered it agayne in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reigne of king Henry the sixth. The Uandales also inuaded a part of Bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gicke, to the whyche at theyr depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence into Spaine they left the name of Flaunders. Many other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions likewise haue settled themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in Fraunce, who being ouermat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched by the Frenchmen are growen into the same name with them. But no one Nation since their firste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge thyther, hath so often and so sore afflicted theym as our Englishe Nation hath done: whose kinges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times before, but specially from the time of king Edward the thyrd, haue contended with theym, not so muche for anye one part or Prouince of the country, as for the substance of the crowne &amp; possession of the whole Realme, descended to our kinges by ryghte of inheritance. And they haue both gayned and hild it many yeres, vntill fortune chaunging her copye, hath transferred the possession again to the Frenchmen, the right remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
<pb facs="11"/>
styl to the Crowne of Englād. In theis oure dayes we see howe not only Flaunders which hath of longe time continewed so, but also all the countryes bordering vpon the Rhine and many cities nere vnto the Alpes are alienated from the Crowne of Fraunce. Whereof some are vnder the iurisdiction of the Spanysh king, some are imperiall, and other some are free. Thus as fortune of warre disposeth, the boundes of thys kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome haue sometime bene enlarged and sometime streightned: the whych who so desireth to know more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly, I remit him to the reading of such Chronacles and Antiquities as entreat therof. I trust this shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for an introduction to thys histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: my paynes in translatyng wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I desier thee to accepte in good part, and to vse them to thy behoofe. And as for the old names of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cities, Townes, Countryes, Hylles and Ryuers, howe they be called at thys daye, together wyth a dyscription of certayne Romane Engynes hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
