   <p>THe Lorde of lyght lyghten thyne eyes, to se
the thyng that is right, &amp; geue the an hearte
to obeye the same, Amen. Thou mayest (good
reader) besydes the open tyrannye, as in a glasse,
playnly see in these lettres, that the popishe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is the kingdome of faces (that is, the mygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye
Antichrist that Daniel wryteth of) yf thou con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sydre
only, what face of iustice (in most open iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice)
it maketh towarde the most mylde Moses,
Thomas Crāmer that most worthy Archebishop
of Cantorbury. He cyteth him to appeare to make
answere at Rome, geuing hym .lxxx. dayes respite,
for his appearaunce there. Is this any thing but
a face of iustice? as thoughe the court of Rome
wolde condemne no man, before he answered for
him selfe, as bothe lawe and equitie require? But
the very same instaunt tyme, Antichristes holynesse
(contrary to that visoured iustice) sent his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siō
vnto that periured beastly Brockes B. of Glou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cestre,
to degrade and depriue him of his dignitie.
Which thing he did, not only before the .lxxx. dayes
were ended, but before ther were .iiij. of thē spent.
Furthermore wher as the sayd most reuerende fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was fast deteyned in most greuous and strayt
prison, so as he coulde not appeare (which thing
was notorious both in Englande, and also in the
Romishe court) and therfore had a lawfull and
most iuste excuse of his absence, by al lawes, euen
popishe and other: yet at Rome in the ende of the
sayd .lxxx. dayes, was that mylde good mā decreed

      </gap>max: that is, sturdely, frowardly, and wilful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
absent. And in payne of the same his absence, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
and in fyne most cruelly and mercyleslye
martyred (alas for pytie) euen by the ministerie of
them, for whose soules sauegarde, he put him selfe
to that hasarde, and gaue his lyfe. Consydre ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(I praye thee) howe the shauen hipocrites
with their complices haue rolled the Quenes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
in wilfull murther by their wynking wyles.
<pb facs="2"/>
For what is it but wilfull murther to cause a man
to be cyted, and yet to detayne him still in fast pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
knowing his absence to be his condemnaciō.
Considre also what manifest periurie and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
they haue wrapped not the Quene alone, but
with her the hole realme of Englande in. For
which the indignacion of God is so prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that he can not longer forbeare to
