   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ood Christian reader, the children, and specially the Priests of Gods Church, haue ben manifoldly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed by their aduersaries in our coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey these later yeres: first by the vvriting and preaching of the Sect-maisters, vvhich made no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: Secondly by authoritie of the Ciuil Magistrate, vvhich vvas more forceible, but yet preuailed no further then to the losse of some rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens transitory goods, &amp; a fevv poore mens temporal liues, neither the one nor the other perished to the ovvners but both laid vp vvith Christ and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved vpon him to the hundreth fould aduantage in the next, and to
<pb facs="3"/>the great encrease of the Catholike partie in this life.</p>
   <p>Lastly by practise and pollicie of certain crafty cōsciēceles men, by fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; forgerie, altering in the sight of the simple the causes of their death &amp; punishment, &amp; making their liues &amp; actiōs odious to the vvorld. Vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby they disaduātaged in deede the Catholike part much more then by any plaine violēce or pretēded iustice vvhatsoeuer. Besides the cōmon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions of Protestants but most false (though grounded vpon the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of their ovvne disloyaultie in the daies of Q. Mary) that al Catholikes be ennemies to the state: vvas it not a great tēptation to such as knovv not the deepe subtiltie of Sathā, to see that certain good fellovves vvere found to preach, print, &amp; aduouch to the faces of the poore desolate persons, yea and to svveare that they had purposed and
<pb facs="3"/>practized the Queenes death? particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recording the time, place, and circumstances: and naming such and such of the Counsel, that vvere vvith all to be massacred, and al this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so coulorably and confidently, or so plausibly &amp; oportunely for the practize, that publike iustice passed vpon them as malefactors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith many pretty pāphlets put forth and spred for the tempering of mens speaches and conceits of such strange procedings. In this case truly a poore and vnaduised man might haue ben either for some time abused, or haue foūd good cause to say vvith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, <hi>Penè moti sunt pedes mei:</hi> my feete vvere almost moued.</p>
   <p>But he that said, nothing is hidd, vvhich shall not be reuealed, vvould not haue this error long to preuaile, but hath to his ovvne glory, the honor
<pb facs="4"/>of his saincts and great aduantage of the Catholike cause in our countrey and the vvhol Church, many vvaies discouered that trechery: as short gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies almost hath the ennimie of such traffick, as Iudas had of the betraying and sale of Christ, vvho disclosed his ovvne treason, yelded vp his money againe, and hanged him self, before his Maister (vvhom he sould) vvas executed. God giue the aduersaries better grace and an other kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance then that proditor had: to saluation and not to perdition. But truely his name be therefore euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly glorified, our mercifull lord, hath merueilously reuealed to the shame of heresie, these sinful inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Churches ennemies.</p>
   <p>The conscience and certen knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of so many good men, that knevv those holy confessors inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb facs="4"/>the vvisedom of others that savv the practiz, coulour, and collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the note of their ansvveres and full satisfactiō giuen at the barre, their vniforme and sincere protestations of their innocencie at their death, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualities of such persons as vvere the first brochers and instruments of their accusation and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, al these things and diuers trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises set forth of the matter, haue opē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made clere the case to the vvhol vvorld: vvhereby god of his old mercies hath turned all these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and apparent distresses to the singular benefit of his truth.</p>
   <p>And lo here more, to see his svvet prouidence and disposition of these things, <hi>Iohn Nichols</hi> him self, the first author of the shamfull fiction, and that first set dovvne the particularities for vvhich the men of god vvere cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb facs="5"/>and executed, falling of late into the handes of the iustice at Roan, hath confessed al the collusion and forgerie. Vvhich vvas thought meete to be published <hi>Verbatim,</hi> euen as him self vvrote &amp; gaue forth to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and others: the Original partly remaining in the court roules, partly to be shevved of his ovvne hand vvriting.</p>
   <p>In setting it dovvne, no one title is altered, nor the very incongruities of his speach amended. And though he vvas in prison vvhen he did it, yet he did nothing of feare or compulsion, being assured that he could not for such matters as he had committed in Englād, nor for religion, be any long time in durance in Fraunce: but al came of deepe remors of mind and conscience for the death of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, vvhich he knevv came by
<pb facs="5"/>his false accusation, vvherevvith he vvas invvardly so vexed in England, though he continued as he dooth yet in his peruerse pretēded religion, that he both confessed his foule dealing to one of the cōdemned persons and to some in office and authoritie there: and also in fine left the Realme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specially, and partly, as he saith him self, because the Bishops vvho vvere cōmaunded and had promised him euery one of them a yerely pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for recompence of that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, vvould not keepe touch vvith him. but shaked him of vvith a <hi>Tu vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> like as the ievves did their copes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mā sudas. Vvhere vpon he obteined a peece of mony of an other, his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal patron, vvho thought it pitie or at least no pollicie to cast the poore miser of, in that sorte, and passed ouer into the lovve countrey vvithout ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="6"/>his leaue, &amp; vvent forvvard into Germany, provvling as his manner hath long ben vvith Epistles for his liuing, and not finding cōtentement so, he purposed into Turkey, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thevvard he vvent on, till by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of his cōpanion one M. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Caddey sometime student of the English College in <hi>Rome,</hi> he vvas turned back from that desperat course into Fraunce: by vvhose godly endeuours for both their saluations, notice vvas giuen of the said <hi>Nichols</hi> in <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and after vvas apprehended in <hi>Roan,</hi> vvhere he vvrote and spake the letters and other things follovving, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon vvas dimissed very shortly.</p>
   <p>And being aftervvard among some contreymen of his ovvne religion, to vvhom he resorted for payment of his fees, he vvas demanded before
<pb facs="6"/>them, by some that vvere Catholiks vvhether he vvould novv being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, auouch all the things confessed in the time of his restraint: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvered that all vvere most certaine, &amp; that he vvould stand to all that he had vttered. A protestant yet he vvould be still, though in prison he shovved him self vvilling to conferre and to yeld to reason, and might at the same time haue easily ben inuited to <hi>Rhemes,</hi> if he had not falne into the Protestants hands, at his releasing. At his first arriual in <hi>Roan,</hi> the vaine man told some of his companions that he had talked and disputed vvith <hi>Doctor Allen,</hi> and that he profered him a hundred pound English a yere to be of his religion. The fellovves lif and fortune, though he be not old, hath ben exceding various, if all vvere recorded sith he first vvas Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
<pb facs="7"/>vvhere his miserie began: but nothing need to be spoken, of the causes of his first comming ouer sea, of his follovving the Camp, of his vvandring in Flanders, Fraunce, and Italy, and such like: onely I thought it necessarie for an introduction to the rest, to set dovvne his formal Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as it is recorded in the Court of Inquisition at Rome: faithfully trāslated into English. Into vvhich office of holy Iustice against Heretikes, he vvent to accuse him self of his ovvne accord, and in the end the matter passed as follovveth.</p>
