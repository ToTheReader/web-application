This mariage was thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte to be made rather for a feare that the kynge had of his estimatiō thē for any loue to his person, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che afterwarde was well proued, whan the kinge, because his sonne in lawe had suche resorte of people, and suche a fame for his newe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne, as he was able to defend it by forse, pryuelye sente men to kyll hym, he nothynge suspectynge the same, and immediately dispatched all them that were of hys opinion. Notwithstandynge hys sonne <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and one of his scolers <hi>Techell,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
scaped alyue. <hi>Hismael</hi> fled to <hi>Coraxam</hi> and <hi>Techell</hi> to the mountaynes of <hi>Armenia,</hi> where he lyued certayne yeares in contemplation hardelye, onelye of such fruytes as the earth brought forth. Shepheardes were the fyrste that perceyued hym, and after other countrey folke, whiche marueylynge at his sharpe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyfe, gaue hym thynges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for his bodye. He lykewyse ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge suche aunswere to them, as semed more then a man myght do, was first brought into the villages and after (as it semed) agaynst hys wyll, into the cities, where euerye man wondered at hym, and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his doctrine. The summe wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of was this, that none of them that honoured <hi>Mahomete</hi> shoulde go to heauen after theyr death, excepte they folowed those ceremonyes of the lawe, whiche <hi>Halie</hi> one of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes</hi> scolers had wrytten and lefte behynde hym, the which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="5"/>
to the interpretations of the misteries, whiche <hi>Homare,</hi> an other disciple of <hi>Mahomete</hi> (and before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued thoroughoute all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,)</hi> had with more certayntye and grauitie of the lawe declared to the people.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Techel</hi> preuayled so muche, that of a prophete of religion, he became a captayne of legions, and kepte longe warre with the Turkes in <hi>Natelia,</hi> and his secte was called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selbase,</hi> by a redde scarfe that they ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed vpon theyr great hattes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Hismael</hi> on the other syde, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this new doctryne, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Lorde of so muche people, as he was hable to ouerthrow <hi>Aluante</hi> with his brother <hi>Maratcham,</hi> sonnes and heyres to the kyngedome and state of <hi>Persia,</hi> and that he myght be thought to do all thynges by inspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he surnamed hym self <hi>Sophi,</hi> accordynge to the title of prynces there, beynge called <hi>Magis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Nowe for the tumultes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities that folowed in <hi>Alamania,</hi> not longe after this, I wyll omytte to tell, because they be meatelye well knowen, and shoulde be to tediouse to be told in this preface, only I wil saye that they proceded so farre, as they raunged from Duchelande to Englande, where was practised the lyke mater, but wanted the like effecte, onely by the myghty power of God, who preserued the royall bloude, from the crueltye of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious deuyce.</p>
   <p>Many opinions ensuynge of this sect, one was more wycked among vs Christians, then amonge the Mahomites: for wher as they were contente to haue one of the auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpretours of the lawe, to be the staye of the same, we wuld haue none at all, but that euerye manne shulde be a prophet at his pleasure: by reason wherof folowed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> grosse errour, that learnynge and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="6"/>
was not alonely not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and expediente, but also wycked and vnprofytable. Who so euer was reputed learned, he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred lyke a serpent. The whiche blasphemous deuice, made me pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyse with most profounde writers, amonge the whiche, I founde thys Homelye of so worthye a doctoure, and trauayled in it, both for latyn and Englishe, but neuer went any further, because I trusted some other of greater knowledge, wulde haue set it forth, with greater auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie. And at that time, it had ben more expedient then nowe, because it is to be hoped, that the chaunge of tyme, haue chaunged many mēs hartes. But because I se some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayndre of that infection styll left in the dominions of this kingdom, I do with no lesse loue of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye, set forth this good lesson to my countrey men, then <hi>Basilius</hi> dyd to his kynsemen. For I am of thys
<pb facs="6"/>
opinion, that the feruent loue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a man heareth earnestly to hys countreye, is not inferioure to that which a father beareth to his chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as he was carefull that his yonge cosynnes shoulde be well instructe and furnyshed with suche knowledge, as might brynge them to the hight of holye scripture: euen so, I as carefully do wysshe all my countrey men, as well younge as olde, to enbrace learnynge, to study for vnderstandynge of Poetes and Philosophers, that they may come the more able to go thorough with the aucthores of Scripture. Yf ye bare the science of humanitie, ye bare all in effecte, yea, diuinitie to.</p>
   <p>Trueth it is, that amonge the Turkes is none other learnynge, than is left behynd in theyr <hi>Alcorane</hi> in so muche as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that sometyme were the floryshyng peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the worlde, be nowe the most vyle and baste, and all because the
<pb facs="7"/>
practise of learnyng is taken from them. Al the auncient Princes and states, founded theim selues vpon religion. The Gentyles had theyr religion in oracles and sacryfyces, whiche they kept so straytelye that the people were moore afrayde of God then of the lawe of men. Is it not euidente that the Romaynes would kepe theyr othe whatsoeuer came of it? <hi>Regulus, Scipio, Torquatus,</hi> and many other testifye the same, whiche in daungerouse tymes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued theyr countrey; and whan this streyghte obseruation waxed loose amonge them, then theyr state fell to ruyne. The Prynces and states of Chrystendome, that wyll main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them selues vncorrupt, must se religion duelye kepte: yf there be no learnynge, there can be no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yf there be no religion, there muste nedes be barbarousnes and confusion. Therefore as this holye wryter <hi>Basilius Magnus,</hi> a noble man
<pb facs="7"/>
borne, wrote this aduertisement in Greke to his nephewes, and they gladlye dyd accept it, so I praye my countrye men as wyllynglye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the same in English, because they that chiefly be entangled with suche errour as I haue tolde, know none other tounge but Englyshe. And as the gentlemen of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> receyued profyt by thys auctor. so may the translation be profytable to all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of this region, the which God graunt. Amen.</p>
