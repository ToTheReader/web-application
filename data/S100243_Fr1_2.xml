   <head>¶ To all true Catholicks and other her Maiesties louing Subiects.</head>
   <p>THE Printer saith, we must be short: briefelie therefore thus. The reports which the Iesuits giue out amongst their adherents: do in some points not much displease vs. Though we cannot haue (if they proue true) what we desired: yet haue we so much, as makes their harts to groane. <hi>We are</hi> (as they say) <hi>acquit in Rome frō schisme.</hi> Burne then your booke <hi>Ma. Lyster:</hi> which you writ against vs. <hi>Tichborne, Hadddock, Aray,</hi> or whosoeuer gaue information, that we were cōdemned in Rome for Schismaticks, to speake plaine English, lyed. And you <hi>R. Archpt Garnet, Iones,</hi> &amp; all the sort of you, blush for shame: (it is some signe of grace) in that you were so peremptory, to lay so false an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpō vs. It appeareth now, that you shewed therein neither iudgement, nor learning: but what spight, &amp; malice, let the world iudge. But more particulerly to you <hi>Ma. Archp:</hi> Is it not reason, that you should with teares bewaile
<pb facs="3"/>
your rashnes: in condemning the <hi>censure</hi> of <hi>Paris?</hi> It is somthing, that you haue so grosse a foyle: but that is not sufficient. What iniurie also haue you done to your <hi>Canonists,</hi> whose testimonies you peruerted triūphantly? Could neither your owne reading, nor your deere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers illuminations, theyr familiaritie vvith GOD, the companions of Iesus, better direct you? Behold (good Readers) your <hi>Apostles,</hi> your Masters, your Pilots, your Leaders.</p>
   <p>Our faculties are iudged (as we also heare) to haue beene <hi>validae ab initio,</hi> sufficient from the beginning, that first we receiued them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent then in like maner Ma. Prouinciall. Your words were blasphemous, when you writ: <hi>that it was sin to intreate vs, or helpe vs to say masse: and that they, who should receiue the Sacrament at our hands, seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue povson.</hi> How ridiculous also haue then your featherlesse bolts beene <hi>(Ma. Archp:)</hi> which full blindly (God knoweth) you haue shot about in euery corner at vs? Many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and prohibitions you haue published <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistraliter</hi> to vexe vs: but with more boldnes, then discretion, as now you may see. And for you <hi>Ma. Parsons:</hi> hath he so indeed? Durst his holines checke you? Could not the Spanish Embassadors preuent such a disgrace? But
<pb facs="3"/>
hold vp your head man. Though <hi>our Archp:</hi> shall be no more bound (as they say) to depend vpon your lips: yet you knowe him to be a <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie Roger</hi> vnto you, and your crue. What he was before commaunded to doe, hee will now performe of his owne accord. As good neuer a whit, as neuer the better: as long as he sitteth at the helme.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Yea,</hi> (but say you) <hi>my Maisters: who must still gouerne the Seminaryes? Wee hope we shall curbe you well enough. Besides, my children, or subiects, the fellowes of Iesus, shall remaine amongst you in spight of your harts.</hi> Good wordes <hi>Father,</hi> Christ Iesus, and your broode, fellow and fellow-like? Good fellewes, wee assure you. But must you gouerne still our <hi>Seminaryes?</hi> Keepe thē your children from them, deere Catholicks: except you intende purposely to haue them trayned vp in treason, if they may haue their wills. <hi>You must remaine amongst vs.</hi> We are hartilie sorrie for it: and that in two respects. First, because you are theyr mediate head: and such a head, as we suspect is either mad, or lately become addle. Why man: what meane you, by the <hi>Propositiōs</hi> sent vs lately out of <hi>France?</hi> You haue forsooth a <hi>Reformation</hi> in hand: whereunto the <hi>Counsell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> must yeeld
<pb facs="4"/>
homage. All must be squared to the Apostles times. It is well said <hi>good Fryer.</hi> The appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of euery Clergie mans part, to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: commeth within the Rules of your newe discipline. And what then shall become of <hi>his holines</hi> estate? Must hee haue no larger a portion, to maintaine him with, then <hi>S. Peter</hi> had? <hi>Blocks</hi> (you will say:) <hi>I onely speake of England.</hi> By your good fauour <hi>Ma. Fryer,</hi> you also affirme, <hi>that after you haue doone your pleasure in England: all other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches elswhere, must conforme themselues to ours.</hi> Certainly, the man is either not well in his wits: or els wee shall haue <hi>R. P.</hi> shortlie transformed into <hi>T. C.</hi> But of these points, you shall heare more before it be long. Secondly: how many Iesuits of your humour in England, so many vassals &amp; sworne friends to the King of Spayne: and consequently so many enemies to her Maiestie, her state, and kingdome: nay wee know not, how many els wee may ioyne with them, Iesuited seculer priests, lay Iesuits, and all other Catholicks, that will be aduised by them, and follow theyr precepts. But must you remaine heere? tell vs truly: Indeede wee feared as much. And therefore we thought it our duties, to acquaint both you (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) and all the rest of her Maiesties true
<pb facs="4"/>
subiects (be their religiō otherwise how it shal) with the <hi>Iesuits Catechisme</hi> (lately publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed) &amp; with this present <hi>Treatise:</hi> that seeing wee cannot preuaile, to haue them all called hence, wee might make it apparant to all (that wil not hoodwinke themselues wilfully) what is to be looked for at their hands. A Iesuit is a Iesuit, wheresoeuer he become. Neyther may England expect lesse, then France hath felt: if they continue amongst vs, and be not better hamperd, then yet they are. We wish, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire with our harts, that all true harted Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen, and especially they, who are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, will be pleased to consider seriously of the things, which wee haue written tending to this purpose: and withall (for this time) to reade and obserue (if not this whole discourse yet) the <hi>85. 86. 87. 88. 89.</hi> pages thereof. GOD preserue this Realme from their Spanish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signements: her Maiestie frō their <hi>Clements, Barrieres,</hi> and <hi>Ehuds,</hi> of the Iesuiticall inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the good estate of the Catholick church from their franticke deformations: vs poore secular priests from their malitious practises: and you all true Catholicks from the leauen of such Pharisees. Amen.</p>
