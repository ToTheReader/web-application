   <p>Your Ladiship hath in your selfe, an excellent agreement of many vertues, of which: though I admire all, Yet I am bound by my profession, to giue especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honor, to your knowledge of Musicke: which in the iudgement of ancient times, was so proper an excelencie to Woemen, that the Muses tooke their name from it, and yet so rare, that the world durst imagin but nine of them.</p>
   <p>I most humby beseech your La: to receiue this worke, into your fauour: and the rather, because it commeth far to begit, of you. From Helsingnoure in Denmarke the first of Iune.</p>
