   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>I of holy letters we be
not sleepie nor vaine readers,
but diligētly marke what we
read, we shall easilie perceaue
that among other commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes
of God, this is not
the last nor the least, which he geueth cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the bringing vp of youth in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his blessed will. For y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> godly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
knoweth right well, that except the
younglinges of a common weale be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
brought vp, and faithfully framed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the right rule of Gods holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
it can not come to passe, but that
his glory (the good parentes being once
deceased) must needes bee obscured in thys
world, the inuocation of his name cease, and
all godly religion decay: yea the men them
selues (if they bee worthy that name) must
needes become brutelike, and be caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with euery straunge doctrine, cōtemne
all laudable lawes, breake all good orders,
follow their fleshly appetites lyke vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="4"/>
beastes, &amp; so at last bring both thēsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
&amp; their realmes vnto vtter destruction.</p>
   <p>Therfore as God in his holy law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of parentes nothing more earnestly thē
to bring vp their children vertuously, and
according to his word: so likewise all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fathers and mothers, haue euer from the
beginning done their vttermost endeuour
to traine vp their younglinges, euen from
the very cradells, in the nurture, feare, and
doctrine of the Lord, supposing them selues
then best to please God, and most to doe the
true office of godly and naturall parentes,
when they studie how to garnish, not theyr
childrens bodies with gay and sumptuous
vestures, but their mindes with noble and
precious vertues, not bow to lift them vp
to transitory dignities &amp; worldly honours,
which as dayly experiēce teacheth, are more
brittle then glasse, and fade away lyke the
grasse, but how to make them honourable
and prayse worthy in the sight of good mē,
and profitable to the cōmon weale, through
vertue, learning, wisedome, and counsell.
And the more the parentes them selues did
excell other in knowledge, wisedome, and
learning, the greater desire had they to bring
their children vnto the lyke perfection, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
heauily, that theirs shoulde in any
poynt degenerate from their fathers ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and not orderly aunswere to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualities of their noble parentes. Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="4"/>
both godly and Ethnicke, doe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vnto vs examples aboundantly in this
behalfe, which I would here gladly recite,
if I had not attempted the lyke enterprise
already in my preface to the <hi>Gouernance of
Vertue.</hi> Againe, if I were not fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that you haue heretofore both red and
also heard of your teacher the same, or els
the like histories.</p>
   <p>Your right honourable and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
father, knowing the good pleasure of
God in thys behalfe, hath also after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of all other noble &amp; godly parentes,
painfully trauailed, both by him self and by
learned teachers, to bring you vp, euen frō
your cradell, in the knowledge of Gods
will, and of good letters, that you might, as
in age, so likewise in vertue and learning,
grow and encrease vnto hys comfort, vnto
your owne commendation, &amp; vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the common weale hereafter. And as
your father is learned, and hath a brest stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
with all godly vertues, so is hys desire
to haue you both learned &amp; vertuous, that
when he shall geue ouer to nature (God so
disposing) hee may leaue behinde hym hys
owne image, yea, as I may so speake, hym
selfe, not onely in lineamentes of body, but
also in vertue, in godlines, in wisedome, in
knowledge, and by thys meanes bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of hys posteritie, a worthy member of
the common weale, both in him selfe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>
hys sonne. It is your dutie therfore to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the good desire of so naturall a father,
and to aunswere the expectation of many,
which looke to finde in you hereafter, that
vertue, learning, wisedome, and grauitie,
that is euidently perceaued in your most
worthy father. Thys shall bee brought to
passe, if according to your beginning ye goe
forth diligently to call on the name of God,
to applie your mind to good letters, to giue
eare to the wholsome admonicions of your
most deare father, and to take heede to the
daily exhortations of your teacher, euer fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
your life according to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And that ye may do this the more cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently,
I geue you thys little treatise,
which shall aboundauntly instructe you in
those pointes of Christian Religion, which
at thys present do most of all become your
age. In it are cōtained the principles of our
profession, which I haue so opened with the
conference of the other scriptures, that they
may worthily seeme to striue with large
Cōmentaries: I haue also set forth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of all estates and degrees, as they bee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aught in Gods word, that all ages, and all
kindes of people, may here learne to know
their dutie, both toward God &amp; hys neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Neyther is any thyng taught in thys
treatise, that is not sufficiently fortressed
with the authorities of the holy scriptures:
so that I doubt not, but the godly learned
<pb facs="5"/>
which loue to heare the voyce of their shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
Christ, wil not disallow this my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Let other intreate of hie misteries, &amp;
clime vp to the hiest heauen, I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to write of thinges according to my
knowledge, and your capacitie, &amp; to creepe
vpon the ground. Let other talke of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
secretes of the blessed trinitie, of
predestination, of the state of the soules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
&amp;c. I will speake of the Articles of
the Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ayth, of the Lordes prayer, of
the x. Cōmaundementes, of the Sacramēts
of Christes church. &amp;c. Let other be counted
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> flowers of learning, for opening, I know
not how secrete mysteries, I force not to be
called vnlearned, so y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> I may know Christ
crucified, and in teaching him, eyther by my
writinges or sermons, winne some vnto
God. But to end, embrace vertue, loue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
garnish your brest with the fruites of
Gods spirite, be not idle, flie vaine and too
much childishe pastimes, spend your tyme
fruitfully, exercise your self in reading gods
worde: so shall God blesse you, multiplie
your yeares on earth, and geue you
ioyfull dayes, vnto the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of your self, and the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ioy of your honourable
parentes, whō with you
I wishe alway pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously
to do.</p>
