   <p>There was this last yeare <hi>1621.</hi> in October last, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed a report of a wonderfull battell fought betwixt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine birdes, called <hi>Stares,</hi> or <hi>Sterlings,</hi> at and neare a Cittie in <hi>Ireland</hi> called <hi>Corke,</hi> which was so strange and admirable an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as the like hath very seldome or never bin heard of, or registred in any History in moderne or former ages. This report being so strange, was of some censured as an vntrue and idle invention, Of others, which vnderstood, and by enquirie were resolved of the truth, it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to prognosticate some strange and dreadfull acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to follow, as warres, plagues or pestilence, with such like coniectures. Sithence which time, namely, this last of <hi>May 1622.</hi> the <hi>Omnipotent Maiestie</hi> of heaven hath not onely reprooved their vanitie, who would not beleeue so strange a Relation, but hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a most dreadfull and lamentable demonstration
<pb facs="4"/>
      of his power and Iustice, resolved what that battell of Birds might or did prognosticate, wherein his Iustice in one respect may be feared, and his mercy by so exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar a manifestation may be sought after in another. In what manner this battell of Birds was performed, is needles in this place to be repeated, because the relation is extant in Print, albeit, fitting for the Reader to know, because he shall thereby vnderstand, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly this dreadfull, and most terrible late Accident in <hi>Corke,</hi> was prognosticated in the clamorous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell fight of the <hi>Stares,</hi> at and neare vnto <hi>Corke,</hi> where the <hi>Stares</hi> began their fiery and furious fight at the East end of the Cittie; there began the first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the ruine of <hi>Corke:</hi> And as the Birds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their fight, so did the Cittie of <hi>Corke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume by fire from heaven, as it is more plainely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Relation following, to which I leaue thee.</p>
