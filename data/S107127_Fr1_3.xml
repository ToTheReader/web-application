   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>CAesar,</hi> whose brain contriv'd at once the fate</l>
      <l>Of his great self and of the <hi>Romane</hi> State,</l>
      <l>With mightie action caus'd, where-ere he stood,</l>
      <l>The trembling place to sweat forth humane bloud.</l>
      <l>Who tam'd rebellion so, as in that sinne</l>
      <l>His own contrivance had the traitour bin.</l>
      <l>How nimble-ear'd! and with what piercing sight</l>
      <l>He could discern advantage! and then fight.</l>
      <l>Cold, waves, winds, hunger, watching, labour, warre</l>
      <l>Were accidents through which he oft did dare.</l>
      <l>How patient for his ends! How quickly he</l>
      <l>Unthought of could defeat his enemy!</l>
      <l>Whose expedition, as an engine hurl'd</l>
      <l>Him from one side to th'other of the world;</l>
      <l>Whose way of victory begot the fame,</l>
      <l>That he but <hi>went,</hi> and <hi>saw,</hi> and <hi>overcame.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Dark stratageme, quick action, and the all</l>
      <l>Of him built up a mighty Generall.</l>
      <l>And to make wonder gaze more, he could be</l>
      <l>Th' Historiographer and th' Historie:</l>
      <l>As if his mightie acts to vanquish men</l>
      <l>Had been on purpose done to trie his pen.</l>
      <l>Oblivion so threw dust upon what he</l>
      <l>Most fairly wrote unto posteritie.</l>
      <l>And thou, brave man at arms, great <hi>Roan,</hi> hast tane</l>
      <l>His lively portraict out of <hi>Mars</hi> his fane,</l>
      <l>And arm'd thy self by him: yea, shown to all,</l>
      <l>Thou knew'st to write, and be a Generall.</l>
      <l>See with what art the Chymist deals, and how</l>
      <l>Spirits from bodies he extracts, so thou.</l>
      <l>How smart he gives his stratagemes, and where</l>
      <l>Their hidden vertue lies he makes appeare!</l>
      <l>Mark with how curious hand he those doth trie</l>
      <l>And fit unto our times, and so apply.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>The <hi>Grecian</hi> tacticks <hi>Cesar</hi> brought to <hi>Rome,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And this brave Duke to us, as from their tombe.</l>
      <l>What weapons and what forms may fit again</l>
      <l>He well revives which seem'd before but vain.</l>
      <l>If e'r <hi>Pythagoras</hi> were right to hold</l>
      <l>A transmigration, he doth it unfold.</l>
      <l>But view his own directions, quick and wise;</l>
      <l>He makes towns strong, but strangely doth surprise:</l>
      <l>He rouzeth lazie minds, and seems to write</l>
      <l>Men into field, and teach them how to fight.</l>
      <l>Mirrour of manhood, that art here, though gone;</l>
      <l>Then Vertues self a better tombe there's none.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And Thou, my Friend, that freely dost discover</l>
      <l>So rich a jewel, and hast brought it over,</l>
      <l>Merit'st no mean applause. Me thinks, I see</l>
      <l>Each noble mind admire thy industrie,</l>
      <l>And cherish thy rare worth; since few there are</l>
      <l>That for the publick undergo such care.</l>
      <l>Mount still in thy endeavours, and shine bright:</l>
      <l>His glorie's great that lends to others light.</l>
