   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Must nedes aduertise the (moost gentle Reader,) that this present text in Latyn which thou seist set here with the Englyshe, is the same that costumably is red in the church, and cōmunly is called S. Hieroms translacion. Wherin though in some places I vse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> honest and iust libertye of a grāmaryan (as nedeful is for thy better vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstondynge,) yet because I am lothe to swarue from the texte, I so tempre my penne, that yf thou wylt, thou mayest make playne cōstruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of it, by the Englyshe that standeth on the othersyde. Thys is done now for the that art not exactly learned in the latyn tunge and woldest fayne vnderstonde it. As for those that be learned in the latyn already, thys oure small laboure is not taken for them, saue onely to moue and exhorte them, that they lykewyse knowynge of whome they haue receaued theyr talent of learnynge, wyll be no lesse greued in theyr callyng to serue theyr brethren therwith, thā we are ashamed here with thys oure small mynistracion to do them good. I besech the therfore take it in good worth: for so well done as it shulde and myght be, it is not▪ But as it is, thou hast it with a good wyll.</p>
   <p>Where as by the authorite of the text I somtyme make it cleare for thy more vnderstondyng, there shalt thou fynde thys mark [] whych we haue set for thy warnynge, the texte neuerthelesse nother wrested nor peruerted. The cause wherof is partely the figure called Eclipsis diuerse tymes vsed in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures, the which though she do garnysh y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sentence in latyn, yet wyll not so be admitted in other tunges: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessite we are constrayned to enclose suche wordes in thys marke. Partely because that sundery, and sometyme to rash wryters out of bokes, haue not geuen so greate diligence, as is due in the holy scripture, and haue lefte out, &amp; sometyme altered some word or wordes and another vsynge thesame boke for a copy, hath cōmytted lyke faut. Let not therfore thys oure diligence seme more temerarious vnto the (gentle reader,) than was the diligence of S. Ierome and Origene vnto learned mē of theyr tyme, which vsynge sundery markes in theyr bokes, shewed theyr iudgmente what were to be abated or added vnto the bokes of scripture, that so they myghte be restored to the pure and very originall texte. Thy knowlege and vnderstondynge in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worde of God shall iudge thesame of vs also, yf it be ioyned with loue to the truth. And though I seme to be al to scrupulous callyng it in one place penaunce, that in another I call repentaunce: &amp; gelded, that another calleth chaist, thys me thynk ought not to offende the seynge that the
<pb facs="4"/>
holy goost (I trust) is the authoure of both our doynges. Yf I of myne owne heade had put in to the new Testament these wordes: <hi>Nisi poe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>eritis. Poenitemini. Sunt enim eunuchi. Poenitentiam agite. &amp;c.</hi> thē as I were worthy to be reproued, so shulde it be ryght necessary to redresse thesame. But it is the holy gooste that hath put them in, and therfore I hartely requyre the thynke nomore harm in me for callyng it in one place penaunce, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in another I call repentaunce, thē I thynk harme in hym y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> calleth it chaist, which I by the nature of thys worde <hi>Eunuchus</hi> cal gelded. Let euery mā be glad to submytte his vnderstō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy goost in them y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> be learned, &amp; no doute we shall thynk the best one by another, &amp; fynde no lesse occasion to prayse god in ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther man, thē in our selues. As y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy goost then is one, workynge in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> and me as he wyl, so let vs not swarue from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vnite, but be one in him And for my parte I ensure the I am indifferent to call it aswell w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the one terme as with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other, so longe as I know that it is no preiudice nor iniury to the meanynge of the holy goost: Neuerthelesse I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry scrupulous to go from the vocable of the text.</p>
   <p>And of truth so had we all nede to be: For the world is capcious, &amp; many ther be that had rather fynde .xx. fautes, thē to amende one. And oft tymes the more laboure a man taketh for theyr cōmodite, the lesse thanke he hath. But yf they that be learned &amp; haue wherwith to mayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> charges byd theyr dewty, they thēselues shulde {per}fourme these thynges, and not onely to loke for it at other mens hādes. At the leest yf they wolde nother take the payne of translatynge thēselues, nor to beare the expenses therof, nor of the pryntyng, they shulde yet haue a good tunge, and helpe one waye, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they cā not do another. God graūt thys worlde once to spye theyr vnthankfulnesse. Thys do not I saye for onye lucre or vauntage y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I loke for at your hādes ye rych &amp; welthy bellyes of the worlde: for he that neuer fayled me at my nede, hath taught me to be cōtent with such prouision as he hath and wyll make for me. Of you therfore y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> be seruauntes to your owne ryches, requyre I nothynge at all▪ saue onely that which S. Iames sayeth vnto you in the begynnynge of hys fyfth chapter: Namely, that ye wepe and howle on your wrechednesse y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shall come vpon you. For certaynly ye haue greate cause so to do, nother is it vnlyke but greate misery shal come vpon you, consyderynge the gorgious fare and apparell that ye haue euery daye for the proude pompt and appetite of your stynkynge car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases, and yet be not ashamed to suffre youre owne fleshe and bloude to dye at youre dores for lacke of your helpe.
