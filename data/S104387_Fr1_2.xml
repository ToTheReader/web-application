      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ondry &amp; reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses why learned men haue vsed to offer and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such workes as they put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, to some such personage as they thinke fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, either in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of abilitie of defense, or skill for iugement, or priuate regard of kindenesse and dutie. Euery one of those considerations, Syr, moue me of right to offer this my late husbands <hi>M. Aschams</hi> worke vnto you. For well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng how much all good learnyng oweth vnto you for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense therof, as the Vniuersitie of Cambrige, of which my said late husband was a member, haue in chosing you their worthy Chaunceller acknowledged, and how happily you haue spent your time in such studies &amp; caried the vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the right ende, to the good seruice of the Quenes Maiestie and your contrey to all our benefites, thyrdly how much my sayd husband was many wayes bound vnto you, and how gladly and comfortably he vsed in hys lyfe to recognise and report your goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hym, leauyng with me then hys poore widow and a great sort of orphanes a good comfort in the hope of your

good continuance, which I haue truly found to me and myne, and therfore do duely and dayly pray for you and yours: I could not finde any man for whose name this booke was more agreable for hope protection, more mete for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to iudgement, nor more due for respect of worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your part and thankefulnesse of my husbandes and myne. Good I trust it shall do, as I am put in great hope by many very well learned that can well iudge therof. Mete therefore I compt it that such good as my husband was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do and leaue to the common weale, it should be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnder your name, and that the world should owe thanke therof to you to whom my husband the authour of it was for good receyued of you, most dutiefully bounden. And so besechyng you, to take on you the defense of this booke, to auaunce the good that may come of it by your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and furtherance to publike vse and benefite, and to accept the thankefull recognition of me and my poore children, trustyng of the continuance of your good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of <hi>M. Ascham</hi> and his, and dayly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the prosperous estate of you and yours to God whom you serue and whoes you are, I rest to trouble you.</p>
