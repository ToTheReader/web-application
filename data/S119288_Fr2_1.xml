   <head>TO THE VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and worthie Ladie, GRACE DARCY.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Madam,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hose notes which were lately writ foorth for your priuate vse, I am now emboldened to make more common; not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conceited worth in them, but to auoid the trouble of yeelding satisfaction to other good friends that desire and expect the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from me. I am sure heerein I shall hurt none, except my selfe; nor so much as offend any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb facs="3"/>
those for whose vse I neuer intended the publishing heereof.</p>
   <p>Your Ladiships fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them in priuate, hath made them thus bold to come foorth in publike, and to grace themselues with the profession of your fauour, which is their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ornament.</p>
   <p>I hope that you which haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them some entertainment in your closet, wil not passe by them as vnknowen, now they present themselues vnto you in the street: and the rather for that they come not alone, but accompanied and assisted with a most profitable Treatise of the same Argument, written long since by one whom your Ladiship reuerenceth, and whose person and labours in the worke of Christ Iesus are much esteemed of the people of God.
<pb facs="3"/>
I shall not need to admonish you of the vse of either of these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises: Themselues, how little soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are in that pointable to speak for themselues. Onely take heed (good Madam) lest in their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of you from the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinne of profaning this holie Sacrament, you be not by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction brought vnto the wicked and superstitious adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
   <p>Thus in haste, vnfainedly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord more and more to blesse the worthy Knight your husband, and your selfe, and from heauen to reward those many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours receiued from you both, I humbly take leaue. Ian. 2. 1608.</p>
