      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T pleased Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in his last great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation 1603. (amongst a great multitude of others) to take to his mercy al my Children, to the great griefe and sorrow of my heart, which caused me to remember the saying of
<pb facs="3"/>our Sauiour Iesus Christ in his holy Gospel: <hi>If these things bee done vnto a greene Tree, what shall bee done to a dry?</hi> And therefore it beseemed mee, rather to prepare for my selfe, that I might bee ready when it pleased God to call mee, then to lament for them which are at rest with Christ. All which considered, caused mee to reade ouer diuers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Bookes; and at last light vpon this, which as it appeareth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this book, was first penned for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="3"/>of one that was in great affliction by reason of sicknesse; who, besides a great number of others, receiued great comfort of the same; for which cause it was first penned. The like cōfort hath it, by the goodnesse of God, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in mee; which moued mee to vndertake the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing hereof in as plaine and fruitfull manner as I could, for the good of euery Christian, without any borrowed phrases. And therefore such as it is, I commend to thy fauo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable acceptance, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="4"/>God that it may work such comfort in thee (and in all other that shall reade it) as it hath done in mee, for the glory of his holy name: vnto whose most mighty protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee.</p>
