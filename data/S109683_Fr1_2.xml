      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here it is so that euery creature by the suffraunce of our lorde god is borne and ordeyned to be subgecte &amp; thrall vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> stromes of fortune. And so in dyuerse &amp; many sondry wyses man is plexed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> worldely aduersytees. Of the whiche I Anthonie wyde wylle Erle Ryuers sord Scales &amp;c. Haue large<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; in many dyfferent maners haue had my parte &amp; of them reueled by thenfinite grace &amp; goodnes of our sayd lord thrugh y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mieane of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> medyatryce of mercy. Whiche grace euydently to me knowen &amp; vnderstonde hath cōpelled me to sette apart all ingratytude. And drone me by reason &amp; {con}scyence as fer as my wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wolde suffyse to gyue therfore singuler loues and thākes &amp; exorted me to dispose me recouerd lyfe to his seruyce in folowynge his lawes &amp; cōmaūdementes &amp; in satsfacyon &amp; recōpēse of myn iniquytees &amp; fawtes before done to seke &amp; execute the werkes that myght be moost acceptable to hym &amp; as fer as my fraylnes wolde suffre me I rested in that wyll &amp; purpose. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge that season I vnderstode the Iubyle &amp; pardon to be atte the holy opostle saynt Iames in Spayne / whiche was the yere of grace .M.CCCC.lxxiij. Than I detremyned me to take that vyage &amp; shyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from Southampton in the mometh of Iully the sayd yere / &amp; so sayled from thens tyll I came in to the Spaynysshe see / there lackynye syght of all londes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wynde beynge good &amp; the wedder fayre. Thā for a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creacyon &amp; passynge of tyme I had delyte and arte to rede some good hystorye / &amp; amonge other there was that season in my company a worshypfull gentylman called Lowys de Bretaylles / whiche gretly delyted
<pb facs="3"/> hym in all vertuouse and honest thynges that sayde to me / he had there a boke that he trusted I sholde ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it ryght wel &amp; brought it to me whiche boke I had neuer seen before &amp; is called the saynges or dyctes of the philosophers. And as I vnderstande it was trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of latyn in to frenishe by a worshypfull man called messyre Iehan destouteuille prouost of Parys whan I had redde and loked vpon it as I had tyme and space I gaue therto a very affeccyon y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in especy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all be cause of the holsom &amp; swete sayenges of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche is a gloryous fayre myrrour to all good crysten people to beholde and vnderstande ouer that a grete comforte to euery well dysposed soule. It spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth also vnyuersally to example well and doctryne of all knyges / prynces and to people of euery estate. It laudes vertu and scyence. It blames vyces and igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunce. And all be it I coude not at that season nor in all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pylgremage tyme haue leyser to ouerse it well at my pleasure what for the disposycyon that be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a taker of the Iubylee &amp; pardon. And also for the grete acqueyntaunce that I founde there of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypfull folkes. With whom it was syttynge I sholde kepe good and honest company / yet neuertheles it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted styll in the desyrous fauour of my mynde enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge vetterly to take there with grete acqueyntaūce at some other conuenyent tyme. And so remanynge in that opinyon after suche season as it lysted the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges grace commaunde me to gyue myn attendaunce vpon my lorde the prynce / and that I was in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce whan I had leyser I loked vpon the sayd boke At the laste concluded in my selfe to translate it in to the Englysshe tonge whiche in my Iugement was
<pb facs="4"/> not before. Thynkynge also full necessary to my sayd lorde the vnderstandynge therof / &amp; leste I coude not at all tymes be so well occupyed or sholde fall in ydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / whan I myght now and than fell in hande w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> all drewe both the sentence &amp; the wordes as nyght as I coude. Neuertheles I haue seen and harde of other of the same bokes whiche dyfference &amp; be of other ym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portaunce / &amp; therfore I drede that suche as sholde ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste to rede the translacyon and haue very intellygen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ony of those bokes eyther in latyn or in frensshe sholde fynde errours in my werke / whiche I wolde not afferme by cause of the cōtrary / but alledge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faute to myn vnconnynge w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> dyuersytees of the bokes humbly desyrynge the reformacyon therof with mȳ excuse / and the rather syn after my rudenes not expert in my maner folowed my copye and the groūd I had de to spoke vpon as here after ensiewys?</p>
