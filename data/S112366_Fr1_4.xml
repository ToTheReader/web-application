   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignoraunt (gentle Reader) how hard a matter it is for any one mā to write that, which should please and satisfie all persons, we being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of so diuers opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary iudgementes: againe Tully affirming, to bee a very difficult thing, to finde out any matter which in his owne kinde may be in all respectes perfecte. Wherefore I trust by your own iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ought of reason to be the sooner pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (my translation being precisely tyed to mine authors meaning) if any thieg herein besides be thought to be wanting: I hauing learned by the way, how comberous a thing it is, to turne the selfe same matter out of the Italian language into our countrey speech. But who doth what he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly can, is bound to no more. And I now at the request of others (who put me in minde, that I was not onely borne vnto my self) haue accōpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that in the end, which I promised &amp; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. With what paine &amp; diligence, I refer me to thē which are skilfull in the Italian toung, or may the better iudge, if it please them to trye the same, casting a side this exampler. I speake not arrogantly, I take God to witnes: but mens pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trauels ought not lightly to be condemned: nor surely at any time are wont to be of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or discrete. By whose gentle acceptation, if these my present doinges be now supported, I will perswade my selfe that I haue reaped suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fruite of my trauell. Vnto whom with all my hart I wish prosperous successe in all their affaires.</p>
