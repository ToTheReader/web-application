parte by the same title (as heepublikelie did protest in an Epistle to the Printer ioynde to the same treatise) his resolution was to accomplish his desire by writing <hi>the returne of the Knight of the Poste,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did many times at large, discourse the maine plot and drift, wherein hee meant to bestow great arte, witte and laborious studie.

Now my selfe who euer challenged most interest in his loue, and nearest allyance to his counsailes, seeing the turbulencie of this last age, and the frantike madnesse where with the Deuil infecteth the minds of most trayterous and wicked persons, I tooke in hand (albeit as vnfit as <hi>Patrocles</hi>
