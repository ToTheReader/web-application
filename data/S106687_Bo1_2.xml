      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT harmony (Right honorable) which is skilfullie exprest by Instruments, albeit, by reason of the variety of number &amp; proportion, of it selfe it easilie stirs vp the minds of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to admiration &amp; delight, yet far higher au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power hath been euer worthily attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to that kinde of Musicke, which to the sweetnes of instrument applies the liuely voice of man, expressing some worthy sentence or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poeme. Hence (as al antiquitie can witnesse) first grew the heauenly Art of musicke: for <hi>Linus, Orpheus,</hi> and the rest, according to the number and time of their Poemes, first framed the numbers and times of musicke: So that <hi>Plato</hi> defines melody to consist of harmony, number, &amp; wordes; harmony na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of it selfe, words the ornament of harmony, number the common friend &amp; vniter of them both. This small booke containing the consent of speaking har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ioyned with the most musicall instrument, the Lute, being my first la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I haue presumed to dedicate to your Lordship, who for your vertue &amp; nobility are best able to protect it, and for your honourable fauors towards me best deseruing my duety and seruice. Besides your noble inclination and loue to all good Artes, and namely the diuine science of musicke doth challenge the patronage of all learning, then which no greater title can bee added to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. Neither in these your honours may I let passe the dutifull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your vertuous Lady my honourable mistris, whose singular graces towards me haue added spirit to my vnfortunate labours. What time and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I haue bestowed in the search of Musicke, what trauel in forren coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, what successe and estimation euen among strangers I haue found, I leaue to the report of others. Yet all this in vaine, were it not that your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hands haue vouchsaft to vphold my poore fortunes, which I now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend to your gratious protection, with these my first endeuors, hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly beseeching you to accept, and cherish thē with your continued fauours.</p>
