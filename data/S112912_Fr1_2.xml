                 <title>A full satisfaction concerning a double Romish iniquitie; hainous rebellion, and more then heathenish æquiuocation : Containing three parts: the two former belong to the reply vpon the Moderate Answerer; the first for confirmation of the discouerie in these two points, treason and æquiuocation: the second is a iustification of Protestants, touching the same points. The third part is a large discourse confuting the reasons and grounds of other priests, both in the case of rebellion, and æquiuocation. Published by authoritie</title>

      <hi>The Discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> (saith he) <hi>is like to the espiall of king Alexander, who brought word that an army of enemies was approching, whē they were but a small companie of sillie Apes, imitating soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in a march from the mountaines: thus he, as a man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered in his braine, and deluded in his fantasie, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our Catholike Priests, whom in euery page he calleth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and traiterous persons.</hi> This then onely was my error; I thought, indeed, that I had discouered a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of men, but my Answerer telleth me they were <hi>but</hi> beastes: and I partly beleeue him, for what men could euer be so sauage, as (for so they haue professed concerning Protestants) to depriue men of the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of all humanitie? Notwithstanding though I had bene so much mistaken, as not to know that his Monks were <hi>but</hi> Munkies, and his Priests <hi>but</hi> Apes, yet sure I am (and he so acknowledgeth) that they were <hi>a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> of creatures <hi>which did imitate souldiers on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</hi> This I then partly discouered, and now (God willing) will proue more plentifully in this <hi>Replie.</hi> The <hi>mountaines,</hi> from whence they march, be those <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 17. 9.</note>
      <hi>Seuen hils of Babylon, whereon the woman clothed in scarlet sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:</hi> which (by the confession of two most learned <note n="*" place="margin">Ribera &amp; Viega in their commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vpon this place.</note> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites) doth signifie <hi>Rome, as it must be in the dayes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</hi> May it now please your sacred Maiestie, to see how exactly they <hi>imitate Souldiers in their march?</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, teaching persecution against all Kings and States Protestant, doth propound for his imitation the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Dauid in his conflict against Goliah;</hi> Allen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Eliah in calling,</hi> if it were possible, <hi>for fire from heauen to consume the messengers of Kings;</hi> Renalds the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iabel to knocke Generals on the head;</hi> Bellarmine

Which doctrine because it is acknowledged by your Highnesse, in your admirable wisedome, to be in Religion most sacrilegious and detestable, in politike state most pernitious and intollerable, &amp; in euery actor most banefull to the soule of man: it may please your excellent Maiestie to prouide in this behalfe for your faithfull and religious Subiects, that they neuer be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with this Antichristian spirit, as either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or be deceiued thereby. First not to be deceiued: but seeing that the authors of Aequiuocatiō are by it, as by a <hi>Gyges</hi> ring, made in a sort inuisible vnto Protestants to plot and practise against them what &amp; when they wil, and Vlysses-like make a verie <hi>Polyphemus</hi> of your most noble State, that whensoeuer they be asked, who is the Traitor, licence themselues during life to answer (till they be cōuicted) by that aequiuocating <gap reason="foreign">

Let not your Maiestie be offended with my boldnesse in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the measure of an Epistle against my accustomed breuitie in all my labors: it is <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 116. 10.</note>
      <hi>Credidi</hi> that begetteth <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golocutus sum.</hi> Therfore speaking from the truth, I could not but speake for truth: and now, in high detestation both of idolatrous superstition, and hellish aequiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beseech the God of truth to make your name glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Christendome, in the zealous defence both of the true faith of Christ, and Christian faithfulnes: esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing your Maiesties kingdome in peace, your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in safetie, your soule in grace, your Queene in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ioy, your royall Succession in happie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse as long as the world endureth; and in the end of mortalitie to crowne you all with endlesse blessednes.</p>
