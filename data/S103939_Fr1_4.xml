   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian and curteous Reader, this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which I haue framed for the glory of God, the comfort of his Church, and the seruice of this common-weale, wherein wee liue, why it is Intituled, <hi>A vision of Balaams Asse,</hi> you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the entry thereof. It containeth in speciall these three, First the cause of my voluntary recantation of Popery, Secondly a cleere discouery of the tyranny of Rome, mounted in our time to her Meridian or Altitude; And of the treacherous trade and doctrine of the Iesuite, who doth falsly maintaine the Papall Soueraigntie tending to the ouerthrow of Christian Princes and states: Thirdly, a discourse of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant approach of her reformation or downefall, and of the probable meanes, whereby the Lord God doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the restitution of Christian people from the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all captiuity of this Babel, with a sincere exhortation to you to honour aswell the meanes, as the instruments, whom God doth pointforth for the aduancement of this great worke, as you haue them here set downe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: In the which exhortation if any thing be, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the suddaine seemeth distastfull to you, I do entreate you that you will not for that rashly reiect it, but do taste it againe and againe, remembring how oftentimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts do grow rather by the distemper of our sence, then by any fault which is in our meats: As a diseased person must for the sake of his health controle his naturall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and as nature in generall (who seldome doth erre) by offering violence vnto her particular members for
<pb facs="9"/>
her common benefite, doth proue a good Physitian to her selfe: So if wee cannot straine our priuate humours for a publike weale, wee are senselesse and cauterized members of the commonweale, and our diseases when they come they shall be desperate and deadly: It was a worthy saying of him who spake so, <hi>Omnis magna lex ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet aliquid iniquitatis,</hi> that euery great law had something of iniquitie in it, not that any expresse iniustice was in the law, but because when so many liue within their own Spheares, onely to themselues, without respect to the commonwealth, it is impossible to establish any great law, which shall not bring displeasure to those particular members, whose actions are not ruled by common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, common reason, or common good. If we doe grudge against our lawes, or our lawgiuers, because they are not pleasant to our peculiar taste, we be farre inferiour in true vertue to the Ethnicks, who thought it the chiefest mark of their vertuous mind, and their greatest glory, to remit proper losses, proper grudges, and proper opinions to the common wealth. The precise <hi>Cato Vticensis,</hi> who might haue brooked the first dignities vnder <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> because it was not to his mind, he chose rather to die then to liue distracted in opinion from the state: That vpright Philosopher <hi>Socrates</hi> hauing in his choice to be banished or to die, he embraced death, saying that a man cast off from his common wealth, was no more a man. Is it not strange then amongst vs, in whom that obscure light of nature (which onely did guide them) is made ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall, by the diuine splendor of Gods reuealed word; to see that a Christian Pastor, before he will quit singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of opinion, and singularity of name to our common wealth spirituall, to the peace and credit of our Church, conforming himselfe to orthodoxall lawes, established by the authoritie of a most Christian Prince, a setled Church and well gouerned state, he will first choose ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue at home a seditious tribune, <hi>In perpetuo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strepit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Certainely where there is no perfect vnitie, there can be no perfect peace nor perfect loue, and consequently no Church, because these are the whole scope of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and of all true Religion: Vnanimitie is the bond which maketh the Church strong, <hi>Ecce circumdedi te</hi>

By the Tabernacle wherof euery thing was iointed in an other, the whole standing in coniunction: for wee bee so called in the Apocal. <hi>Ecce tabernaculum Dei cum heminibus &amp; habitabit cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

For the first, that which is agreeable with the word, is to be retained, or if it be reiected, it is againe to be receiued: for the second, that which is contrary, is to be refused, or if it hath been followed, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be forsaken: for the third, that which is indifferent, we must not thinke that it doth of it selfe belong vnto saluation, but in such a case we must follow the rule of the Apostle, That nothing bee brought into the Church, but that which doth tend to edification, order, or vnity: All indifferent ceremonies therefore, may bee securely followed for any of those respects; but so to be followed as that we stil preferre things which bee more ancient, vnto those which be more late, aswell for the honour of antiquity, as because that which is most ancient in the Church is most true, for albeit nothing can binde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science but canonicall Scripture, yet to introduce nouelties, or to banish out of the Church any of those things, which from the primitiue time hath beene allowed by common and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like consent, and confirmed by the writtes of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. To reiect such things, with out authoritie of generall Councell, it is not lawful for any Christian man who feareth God, saith he,</hi> Can we maintaine more sound opinions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as good Christians, or as good subiects, then those of <hi>Zanchius</hi> for vnity, tending to the strengthening both of Church &amp; State: we especially of this Isle, the condition wherof, if we consider truely, when it lay thousands of yeres of our ancestours, diuided in weake and dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Kingdomes, and as our owne eies haue seen it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ambition of so many forrain <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> as haue pressed to bring it vnder their seruitude, by practises now from France, now from Spaine, now from Rome:

the Lords indignation vpon themselues, and vpon him, who both were preuented by death, and were not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter into the Land, nor to taste the fruits of their long and painefull voyage in the Wildernesse: God of his goodnes grant you to loath these waters of strife, and chiefly these waters which bee poysoned with Iesuiticall wormewood and gaul, wherof so many millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue died within these threescore yeres, that you may cry in time with that Prophet, <hi>Saluum me fac Domine quoniam intrauerunt aquae vsque ad animam meam,</hi> Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me, O Lord, because those waters haue gone vnto my Soule. God grant (that like vnto the holy Doue) you finde no resting place among them vntill you enter into the Arke and vnitie of the Church, that we may liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one hope, to see the further mysteries of this happy time, the seale whereof is already opened to the great admiration of all the world. It was forbidden an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to sacrifice a Swan, because her plumes are white and her heart black, so would I wish that from this peace offering might be debarred all such, whose hearts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably blacked with pride of stricktnesse and singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it should bee onely handled of those meeke and ingenuous spirits who will bee contented to found their iudgement thereof, vpon those three grounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which our knowledge cannot be sure, as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> faith, <hi>Contrarationem nemo sobrius, contra scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

And so hoping that the modest Reader will obserue these grounds, I doe submit my selfe to his discretion, beseeching him that he would not looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my paines with his sinistrous eye, nor receiue with the wrong hand that which I doe present vnto him with the right.</p>
