   <head>THE PREFACE Apologetique to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that Warres haue beene authorized by the diuine powers, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the new and old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet me thinkes I heare many nice, peeuish, and ignorant braines blaming me for setting downe to the view of the world (at a few leisurely houres) so many wayes and inuentions how to corrupt and destroy what nature and art striue to make, edifie and conserue, to whom I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer they haue the same reason to exclaim against iustice which hath found and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb facs="5"/>
many meanes to abolish and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate wicked offenders: for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is here but onely to finde inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to confound and ruinate Rebells and their habitations; that afterward Empires, Kingdomes, and Common-wealths may the better liue in peace and tranquilitie: and what more is I haue set downe perspicuously this Treatise of Fire-workes, which many heretofore haue written with confusion and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having pend large Volumes with most ample and idle discourses touching this subiect, whose names for modesties sake I will not here set downe with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous character to posteritie (as Master <hi>Robert Norton</hi> hath done some few slight offenders names in the Preface to his translation of <hi>Vianos</hi> works, which he calleth his owne, hauing onely added seuen figures taken out of <hi>Thybourels</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
booke, and transposing the Authours workes to disguise it) that I bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongst the calumniators of this age, who write with serpents tongues spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their venome vpon the silent and sleepi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>g innocents gone before vs. But I will onely shew their errors in generall, that the learners may the better auoyde them: For in some you shall see prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all sorts of Apothecaries drugges for the compounding of Fire-workes, which are no more capable of fire then stones, earth, or mettle, as Adamant-stone, Verdigrease, Cristall, Vitrioll, Salarmoniacke, Sublime, Mercurie, with a number of the like, which in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ignorants may produce in Fire-workes wonderfull effects. In others you shall finde the coniunctions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible materials in such a sort or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="6"/>
disposed and ordered to such strange ends, that you would say they were set downe to make the Reader laugh, rather then for seruice of Fire-workes eyther for Warres or Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the meanes how to poyson an Armie in the wide Field by the smoake of an artificiall Ball, is it not to be thought a very prettie imagination, or else that the Ball ought to bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigge; and afterward which is more ridiculous, you shall finde in the same Authours the same ingredients and mixtures prescribed for Fireworks for Pleasure and Recreation: which to mee seemes strange, that the Fire-workes whose smoakes are so venemous even as to poyson Armies in the open Fields, shall bee also fit to burne in the middle of a Cittie or Towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb facs="6"/>
thousands of people for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations: now all these idle conceites with a number of the like are printed in many new and recent bookes, the Authours whereof doubtlesse haue set downe all these ridiculous inventions by ignorance, (thinking them good) and not of purpose for spight; and therefore they doe deserue pittie rather then blame; as well as <hi>Master RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT NORTON,</hi> (who hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely in attributing another mans workes, and faults to bee his owne) and what is it that giues mee cause to thinke that all these haue erred by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, is because that all their workes are alike where that they doe speake of Fire-workes. But reading these absurdities with a great quantitie of others, which made mee take reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb facs="7"/>
to set my penne to paper, and shew to posteritie how and what way to auoyde their errours, having heere set downe the true rules and mixtures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Fire-workes, both for VVarres and Recreation, with some few Geometricall obseruations necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the practise of Fireworkes in warres; and also I haue added vnto it certaine rules and maximes of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, very requisite for Enginiers to haue in their memorie, with a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arithmetike, hauing written the whole first in French at some broken houres whilest I followed the warres; and bringing certaine coppies from the Presse to my speciall and very good friends; at whose requests I haue translated the same into English, that others might not translating it, mistake my meaning;
<pb facs="7"/>
and the worke being already but of small commendations, they to make it of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. Adiew. <hi>London the 22. of May. 1629.</hi>
