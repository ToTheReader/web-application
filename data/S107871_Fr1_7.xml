   <head>THE PRAEAMBLE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He surprising of the Bishop of Rome his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, to whose scepter (a croisier) all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and kingdomes, and empires were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled, is, now of late growen so hotte, that now a daies, all Primacie, and the name of Primacie is found guiltie, (not guiltie,) and thought worthie to bee exiled the Church of Christ: (wisely.) For by that meanes, all the tyrranie of Prelates may be subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But they are farre wide in my iudgement. The Tarquines once exiled Rome, the very name of King becam odious amōg them: as if (for-sooth) with the name of those tyrants, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had ceased. But were they not afterwardes (and then iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) thralled and threshed, as men thresh corne, with more, &amp; more kinds of tyranny, then if they had retained still the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine name of Kings and their princely authoritie? Neither indeed, is there any tyrāny at all in the name of a King, but in the nature of a Tarquine. And the like wee may iustlie say in this action: that the pride and tyranny, with the which the Church of Christ was wearied and wasted, was not in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of Bishops and Archbishoppes, but in the persons which did abuse their authoritie, and going beyond their commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, extended the bounds of their Prouince, further then might lawfully stand with the modestie and moderation of christian Religion: by which meanes indeede, the power of Rome is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come excessiue and insupportable. But shall I now, vppon this bare presumption, indite of tyranny, the more auncient forme
<pb facs="18"/> of Church pollicie, and so many godly men, (or rather Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men) of rare learning, sincere liues, and sound Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or shall I condemne of error, those sacred and religious Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes, in the which, holy men of God did ratifie that auncient pollicie of the Church, which with reuerence (as they ought,) they receiued of their godlie predecessors? Farre bee that sinne from my thoughts, as far as is this impure age from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. For albeit I am not ignorant, that both Fathers and Councels may erre, (if they enact against the will and word of God,) notwithstanding, it followeth not, that therefore they erred in this. But if so be we were thus equally affected towards others and our selues, that as we know a natural infirmitie to be vniuersallie infused in the natures of all men, so with all we wold acknowledge the same, to be particularlie imprised in our selues also: we would then more diligently search and prie into the reprehension of our selues, rather then of others: But now it is far otherwise with vs. Is there anye thing in the Fathers (for some especiall cause moouing vs) misliked of vs? By and by we haue this theoreme at our fingers end: We must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>they were but men;</hi> and because men may easilie erre, we muster whatsoeuer we mis-conceiue of them, among the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that age. In the meane while, wee neuer remember our selues, <hi>that we also are but men,</hi> and therfore may erre with them: yea, we are such men, (neither are we exempt from the common infirmitie of men) who may then er, when we thinke amisse of them, and in that verie thing may wee erre, for the which we condemne them.</p>
   <p>This is once: that against the constant and consonant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of the ancient church, we ought not to attempt, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit anie innouation, without a plaine commission from Gods holie writ: and this also I dare boldly say, that whosoeuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away al authoritie from the Fathers, he leaueth none for
<pb facs="18"/> himselfe. Indeed it must bee confessed, that the Fathers were men, and that they had their wrinckles: yet can it not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that to haue our Fathers to bee our Patrons in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points of faith, and externe pollicy of our church, (things controuerted betweene the Popelings and vs) is a matter of no small moment, and of especiall account. And albeit, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme consent of Gods children from the Apostles times vnto this day, may not be compared with the eternall word of God: Notwithstanding, of right it may come in, and stand for the second place.</p>
   <p>The custome of gods people, receiued of all Churches tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out the whole world, is in maner of a lawe, sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable: Neither is there any likelihood, that there could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene an vniuersall consort of all Churches and ages, without either the authoritie of gods word, or the tradition of the Apostles. Notwithstanding, for as much as no consent, no custome, no auncient prescription, can, or ought to preuaile in the Church of Christ, against the word of God; Therefore, those reasons are to be weighed, and those Scriptures to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, which mooued the Fathers to intertaine, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that Church gouernment, which our newe reformers will in no case agree vpon; that we may certainelie know, whose is the error; theirs, or ours.</p>
   <p>The time hath bene, when no good men disallowed of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Archbishops: but now, in despite of the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, &amp; his complices, it is come to this passe, that their very names are called into question: and that of diuerse men, for diuerse causes. Some, because they are (as they suppose) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises of Antichrist, or his fore-runners, thinke them vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie thee Church, and worthie to be cast ouer-boorde. Others, yet more modest, in some reuerence of antiquitie, thinke they may be borne with all for a time, (although in the mean
<pb facs="19"/> time they allow not of them) vntill such time, as commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the names may bee antiquate with the thinges themselues. In the meane while, for that they know, (neither can they be ignorant) to what singular effect the Church of God hath bin gouerned by graue and godlye Bishops, they haue not the face to condemne them openly: yet because they see certaine refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches of this age, to be gouerned without Bishops: It is enugh: they haue not the power any longer to tollerat the more auncient gouernment. O the regiment of Pastors and Elders passing all antiquitie, our soules haue longed for thee, and we haue a desire vnto thee: for that thou alone art grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lord Iesus his institution, and thou, (if any) art wholy purified of all tyranny and ambition.</p>
   <p>O, but by your leaue (good brethren) the shadowe you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, is no substance: neither is the plot you conceaue, a priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged place. Are you so far in loue with your liuelesse Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion, the worke of your owne hands? I know who is not: &amp; hee hath reason for his, why not; For neither is your newe draught of straunge gouernement, sufficientlye prooued by the word of God: neither is it yet, (or can at any time) bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the example of our Elders. And how should it? (if we should iudge aright of it) seeing it was partly vnknowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as a thing insolent and not heard of: and partlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of them, as a thing Heriticall, and not approoued of. Wherefore, to speake the plaine truth, without flatterie or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie: I thinke of this new forme of Church gouernment, as some thinke of our Bishops regiment: Namely, that it is but a deuise of mans conceit, and there to be tollerated, where a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot bee obtained. And contrariwise; that which is disallowed of some, as deuised by man, seemeth vnto me to bee the verie ordinance of God, and the onely true gouernment of the Church; as that which hath his institution from God; not
<pb facs="19"/> only in the old, but in the new Testament. But because it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with the manifolde abuses of men: that which were to be layd vppon the person, is imputed to the function; as if (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) no such miscariage might befall this their nouell kinde of gouernement.</p>
   <p>The Romish Antichrist, with his Bishops, Archbishops, Patriarches, and Metropolitanes, hath so troubled and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the Church of Christ, that tyranny it selfe, is thought to bee masked vnder those honest and honorable titles. It is most true: He that is once stong of a Serpent, suspecteth euery stone: and once bitten of a dog, is affraid of euery cur. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they might apply some remedy to this maladie, haue reuersed those names, and yet retained the same things; and for Bishops, haue anoynted Superintendents, and for Archbishops, generall or prouinciall Superintendents: as if the controuersie were not for the thing it selfe, but for names sake. But (wise as we are) seeing the signification of wordes, is variable and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie: when we agree in truth, what neede these garboyles about termes? If the formes of gouernment, which are signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those termes, are contained in gods worde; Is there anie reason or sense, that in disgrace of those names, these formes should not be retained of vs? If any man obiect, that in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Bishops there are many corruptions: I make no question of that; So wee might cauill with the gouernment of the ciuill Magistrate: hath it not his corruptions? Haue they not their infirmities? Yet was there neuer anye that had his fiue wits, who thought that a sufficient reason to remooue those from their place, that are president in the state. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our question is not, how the Bishops haue abused their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye, but whether the Lorde hath so forbidden this their Primacy, that there may bee, nor Pastor ouer Pastor, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop ouer Bishop, in the outward pollicie of the Church. As for
<pb facs="20"/> the rest, if any will accuse the Bishops or their Consistories, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of neglect dutie, or corrupt dealing: no man will be their hinderance, why they may not prosecute that, (and persecute them) before the chiefe Magistrate. I take not vppon mee the apologie of anie Bishop: I am not so worthie; they are not so weake, as that they need my Patrocinie; they are able to say for themselues, and to gaine-say their accusers; onely I lament, that the antique order of church gouernement, (of great and long esteeme with our fore-fathers) should be negligentlie lost, or violently taken from vs: and I feare me greatly, least in the infelicitie of this age, it be vtterly taken from vs. For who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and greeueth not to see, how men are set together vpon mischiefe? euen to reduce the whole Ministerie of the church, to the bare Ministerie of the word.</p>
   <p>But this our present controuersie, can by no meanes better bee decided, then by conferring the orders of the Ministery in that order as they were ordained of God, and deliuered of the Apostles: according to their singular degrees, and seuerall seasons, as they were then in vse: So shall we easily learne, what order is consonant to the word of God, and what dissonant: the which, that I may the better performe; there are two thinges which affoord me fit ingresse thereunto. The first is, the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of those seuerall orders: The second is, that one place of S. Paule to the Ephesians, the fourth chapter, where he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the diuerse Ministeries of the church, distributed into their seuerall degrees. Wherein the first place are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted (as the chiefe Patrons, and first Patriarches of the gospel) Apostles; in the second, Prophets; in the third, Euangelistes; in the fourth, Pastors and Doctors. Of all the which, we are now to discourse in their due order. And albeit Paul seeme to write of the functions giuen to the church after the Assention of Christ: Notwithstanding wee will looke backe a little further
<pb facs="20"/> for this matter, neither will we cease our diligent persute, vntil wee come to that time and place, in the which Christ selected his twelue Apostles; and so returne by the seuentie and two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, whom hee ordained also, and added to the Apostles, for the preaching of the gospell throughout Iewrie.</p>
   <p>And albeit, this discourse doe chieflie intend the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Ministers; yet by the way, we haue somewhat to say of Deacons also. For whereas the doctrine of life, doth not nusle vs vppe in anie idle contemplation of good things, but rather traineth vs vp in the practise of all goodnes, especially of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie: Therefore of the Ministerie of the gospel, there ariseth an other Ministery, which exerciseth it selfe about bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely necessaries of this life, and consequently hath imposed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it the dispensation of the church stocke: whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that there is a twofold Ministery of the church: One, which only respecteth the glory of God, &amp; ou souls helth: An other, which regardeth the procuration of earthly thinges, and the preseruation of this present life. After these thinges handled, and set out of hand as I may: in the sequel of this my trauell, I wil intreat of that honor and reuerence, which by the lawe of God, instinct of nature, and right of nations, is proper and peculier to the sacred Minister. And last of all, against the gourmandiers of church goods, I will set downe and lay before their eies, the odious sin of Sacrilege, with the dires and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accompaning the same. And these three things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of their natures, I haue distinguished into three bookes: but because they are of some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, and rise togeather insequence, I haue also laied them togeather in this one volume.</p>
