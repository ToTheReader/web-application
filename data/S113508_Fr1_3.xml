   <head>M.T. To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THou hast béere gentle Reader, the historie of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> an Emperour in <hi>Greece:</hi>
      <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the storie.</note> whether a true historie of him in déed, or a fained fable, I wot not, neither did I greatlye séeke after it in the translation, but by me it is done into English for thy profit &amp; delight. The chiefe matter therein contained, is of exployts of warres, and the parties therein named, are especially renowmed for their magnanimitie &amp; courage. The authors purpose appeareth to be this, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thereby, &amp; to set on fire the lustie courages of young Gentlemen, to the aduauncement of their line, by ensuing such like steps. The first tongue wherein it was penned was the <hi>Spanish,</hi> in which nation by common report, the inheritaunce of all worldly commendation hath to this day rested. The whole discourse in respect of the ende not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie: for the varietie &amp; continuall shifte of fresh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verie delightfull: in the speaches short and swéete, wise in sentence, and warie in the prouision of contrarie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. For I take the grace thereof to be rather in the reporters deuice, then in the truth of this report, as I wold that I could so well impart with thée that delight, which my selfe findeth in reading the Spanish: but seldome is the tale carried cleane from anothers mouth. Such deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as I haue made I hope thou wilt friendly accept, the rather for that it is a womans worke, though in a storye prophane, and a matter more manlike then becōmeth my sexe. But as for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> manlinesse of the matter,<note place="margin">That a woman may vvrite of vvarre.</note> thou knowest that it is not necessarie for euery trumpetter or drumslare in the warre to be a good fighter.<note place="margin">That a woman may vvrite of vvarre.</note> They take wages onely to incite others, though themselues haue priuie maymes. and are therby recurelesse. So gentle Reader if my trauell in Englishing this Authour, may bring thée to a liking of the vertues héerein commended, and by example thereof in thy Princes &amp; Countries quarrell to hazard thy person, &amp; purchase good name, as for hope of well deseruing my selfe that way, I neither bend my selfe thereto, nor yet feare the speach of people if I be found backward, I trust euery man holdes not the plough, which would the ground were tilled,
<pb facs="4"/>and it is no sinne to talke of <hi>Robinhood,</hi> though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shot in his bowe: Or be it that the attempt were bolde to intermeddle in armes, so as the auncient <hi>Amazons</hi> did, and in this storie <hi>Claridiana</hi> doth, and in other stories not a few, yet to report of armes is not so odious, but that it may be borne withall, not onely in you men which your selues are fighters, but in vs women, to whome the benefit in equall part apperteineth of your victories, either for that the matter is so commendable that it carryeth no discredit from the homelynesse of the speaker, or for that it is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowen, that it fitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th euerie man to speake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it iumpeth with this common feare on all parts of warre and inuasion. The inuention, disposition, trimming, and what else in this storie, is wholy another mans, my part none therein but the translation, as it were onely in giuing enterteinment to a straunger, before this time vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our countrie guise. Marie the worst perhaps is this, that among so many straungers as dayly come ouer, some more auncient,<note place="margin">That a woman of your yeres may vvrite in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> &amp; some but new set forth, some penning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great weight and sadnesse in diuinitie, or other stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> profession wherof more néerely beséemeth my yeres, other some discoursing of matters more easie and ordinary in common talke, wherein a Gentlewoman may honestly imploy her trauaile. I haue notwithstanding made counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance onely to this gentleman, whom neither his personage might sufficiently commend it selfe vnto my sexe, nor his behauiour (being light &amp; soldier like) might in good order ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint it selfe with my yeares. So y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the question now ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of my choice, not of my labour, wherefore I preferred this storie before matter of more importance. For answere whereto gentle reader, the truth is, that as the first motion to this kind of labour came not from my selfe, so was this peece of worke put vpon me by others, and they which first counsailed me to fall to worke, tooke vpon them also to bée my taskemasters and ouerséers, least I should be idle, and yet because the refusall was in my power, I must stand to answere for my easie yéelding, &amp; may not be vnprouided of excuse, wherin if I should alledge for my selfe, that matters
<pb facs="4"/>of lesse worthinesse by as aged yeares haue bene taken in hande, &amp; that dayly new deuises are published, in songs, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, enterludes, and other discourses, and yet are borne out without reproch, onely to please the humour of some men: I thinke I should make no good plea therin, for besides that I should finde therby so many knowen enimies, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en men haue bene authors of such idle conceits, yet woulde my other aduersaries be neuer the rather quieted. For they would say, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as well the one as the other were all naught, and though peraduenture I might passe vnknowen amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest a multitude, and not be the onely gaze or odde partie in my ill doing, yet because there is lesse merit of pardon if the fault be excused as common, I will not make that my defence which cannot helpe me, and doth hinder other men. But my defence is by example of the best, amongst which, many haue dedicated their labours, some stories, some of warre, some Phisicke, some Lawe, some as concerning go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, some diuine matters, vnto diuerse Ladyes and Gentlewoman. And if men may and do bestow such of their trauailes vpon Gentlewomen, then may we women read such of their workes as they dedicate vnto vs, and if wée may read them, why not farther wade in them to the search of a truth. And then much more why not deale by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in such arguments, especially this kinde of exercise, béeing a matter of more héede then of déepe inuention or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite learning, and they must néedes leaue this as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that in their dedications, they minde not onely to borrowe names of worthie personages, but the testimonies also for their further credite, which neither the one may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund without ambition, nor the other graunt with out ouerlightnesse: if women be excluded from the viewe of such workes, as appeare in their name, or if glorie onely be sought in our common inscriptions, it mattereth not whether the partyes be men or women, whether aliue or dead. But to returne whatsomeuer the truth is, whether that women may not at all discourse in learning, for men laie in their claime to be sole possessioners of knowledge, or whether they may in some manner, that is by limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
         <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>or appointment in some kinde of learning, my perswasion hath bene thus, that it is all one for a woman to pen a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as for a man to addresse his storie to a woman. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all my ill willers, some I hope are not so straight that they would enforce me necessarily either not to write or to write of diuinitie.<note place="margin">That you may not write of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>uinitie.</note> Wheras neither durst I trust mine owne iudgment sufficiently, if matter of controuersie were handled, nor yet could I finde any booke in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tongue, which would not bréed offence to some, but I perceiue some may be rather angrie to sée their Spanish delight tourned to an English pastime:<note place="margin">That you meant to make a cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of your paines.</note> they could well allow the storie in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, but they may not affoord it so cheape, or they woulde haue it proper to themselues. What natures such men bée of, I list not greatly dispute, but my meaning hath bene to make other partners of my liking, as I doubt not gentle Reader, but if it shall please thée after serious matters to sport thy selfe with this <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that thou shalt finde in him the iust reward of mallice &amp; cowardise,<note place="margin">The vse &amp; profit of this Spanish translatiō</note> with the good spéede of honestie and courage, béeing able to furnish thée with sufficient store of forreine example to both purposes. And as in such matters which haue bene rather deuised to beguile time, then to bréede matter of sad learning, be hath euer borne away y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> price, which could season such delights with some profitable reading: so shalt thou haue this stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger an honest man when néed serueth, and at other times either a good companion to driue out a wearie night, or a merrie lest at thy boord. And thus much concerning this present storie, that it is neither vnséemely for a woman to deale in, neither greatly requiring a lesse staied age then mine is. But of these two poynts gentle Reader I thought to giue thée warning,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</note> least perhaps vnderstanding of my name &amp; yeares, thou mightest be carried into a wrong sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of my boldnesse &amp; rashnesse, from which I wold glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frée my selfe by this plaine excuse, and if I may deserue thy good fauour by like labour, when the choyce is mine owne, I will haue a speciall regard of thy liking. <hi>So I wish thee well.</hi>
