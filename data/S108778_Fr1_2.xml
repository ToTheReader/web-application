<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Stratagems</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as vnto one that is furnished with stratagems, wisedome, and knowledge, of whō I may say, as <hi>Plato</hi> spake of such like, <hi>Consili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eius est, qui rei cuius{que} peritus.</hi> Such wise and graue councellors the Lord euer prouided, to attend on godly and vertuous Princes, as eyes and eares, to preuent both home and forraigne stratagemes of enemies, as <hi>Chusai</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> to preuent the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpose of <hi>Absalon;</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> with <hi>Salomon,</hi> to finde out the trecherous intention of <hi>Adonias.</hi> The Lord left not the wicked Samaritans vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of Prophets &amp; councellors, yea euen amōg Infidels and Pagans the Lord stirred vp <hi>Daniel</hi> to counsel <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> in <hi>Babilō,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioseph</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell <hi>Pharao</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> that they might confesse &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be the Lord; therfore wel said <hi>Solon, Non quae suauissima, sed quae optima, sunt cōsulenda:</hi> It is not the cōsultatiō of the Romains with their soothsaiers, that made their Empire so to florish, nor of the Persians with their <hi>Magi,</hi> that got the Monarchy of the Assyrians to <hi>Persia.</hi> All strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, victories, &amp; good counsell commeth from the Lord, so wisdom saith, I dwel with Princes in councell, and am among them that seek wisdom &amp; knowledge. <hi>Plato</hi> the Philosopher could so say, <hi>Omnis consultatio quiddam sacrum est:</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> his scholler, called councell of Princes, <hi>Diuinissimum</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>consilium.</hi> The kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> when they admitted any into councell, tooke their fignet, &amp; laid it on their mouths, as a seale of silēce, saying, <hi>Anima cōsilij secretū;</hi> so <hi>Alexā:</hi> did to his councellor <hi>Ephestiō;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any be of councel in <hi>Persia,</hi> but such as were in coūcell most secret, &amp; in gouernmēt most wise &amp; prudent. The cause why <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was so esteemed amōng the Atheniās, was his wisdō &amp; policie often to preuent the force &amp; stratagems of <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon.</hi> The cause why <hi>Vlixes</hi> was iudged more worthy of <hi>Achilles</hi> armor then <hi>Aiax,</hi> was his experience and councell to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the Grecian warres. So it may be well spoken of <hi>Nestor,</hi> who was preferred before all other Greeke Captaines, for the like cause, <hi>Multitudo enim sapientū sanitas orbis terrarū est,</hi> saith wisdom. It was not the counsel of the Nimph <hi>Egeria</hi> to <hi>Numa,</hi> which was ridiculous, but the wisedome &amp; policie of <hi>Numa,</hi> therby to establish his lawes, much commēded. Neither the counsell of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the Capitoll to <hi>Scypio,</hi> which was foolish, but the policie &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Scypio,</hi> therby to animate his soldiers, much extolled. But no councell, no policie against the Lord, no wisdom nor Stratagem to ouerthrow a king or a kingdom, but the sins of the king &amp; the kingdome. So could <hi>Cratippus</hi> the Philosopher, to that effect answere <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, <hi>Fata per causas</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>agunt;</hi> So could <hi>Phaetenissa</hi> the Witch answere <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Endor, Fatum pietatis appendix;</hi> So could the Idoll of <hi>Apollo</hi> aunswere <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> the one willing to know what should become of the kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> the other of the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi> But such busie ambitious braines, like <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Lentulus,</hi> that dreamed, he should be the third <hi>Cornelius</hi> that should gouern the Empire, were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of <hi>Athens</hi> by the law <hi>Ostracismus,</hi> &amp; such might not come in <hi>Rome</hi> in gownes or in long cloakes into the Senate house, by the law of <hi>Cinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Many haue <hi>Iocobs</hi> voice, but they haue <hi>Esaus</hi> hands, like <hi>Balaam, Qui vocem non mentem mutant.</hi> These dissembling <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were found out by <hi>Ioshuah;</hi> these bragging <hi>Ephraimites</hi> were tried by pronouncing the letter <hi>Schiboleth.</hi> None can resist the set purpose of the Lorde, who could hinder <hi>Moses</hi> of his triumph in the midst of the sea? or let <hi>Ioshuah</hi> to set his trophey in the middest of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens? euen he that commaunded the seas to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and commanded the Sun to stand ouer <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,</hi> and the Moone ouer <hi>Aialon;</hi> to whom iustly belong all stratagems, victories, tropheys, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes.</p>
