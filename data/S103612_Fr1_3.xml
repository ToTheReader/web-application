   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Carier</hi> was for his ranke, the
degrees and places of charge hee held
and passed through (expressed at large
in the <hi>Printers Epistle, prefixed to his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
will speake sufficiently, though I
were silent; what for his learning, this Letter will
partly testifie; and for his other qualities such infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
as were offered mee, though by men of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
and I could haue gathered out of diuers of his
Letters and Papers, which I haue in mine hands, I
chose rather to suppresse in silence then to publish:
His immoderate <hi>Ambition</hi> alone, (which himselfe so
freely acknowledgeth in diuers places) was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
sufficient to corrupt a stronger iudgement then
his, in matter of Religion; specially being crossed in
his designes: That was it, which cast the <hi>Angels</hi> out of
heauen, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and still casteth
most <hi>Apostates</hi> out of the Church.</p>
   <p>Ambition <hi>sayeth one (whom</hi> Master Doctor <hi>in his
Letter deseruedly commendeth for a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)</hi>
is like choler, which is an humour that maketh men,
<pb n="10" facs="7"/>
actiue, earnest, full of alacritie and stirring, if it be not stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
but if it be stopped and can not haue his way it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
adust, and thereby maligne and venemous: so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
men if they find the way open for their rising, and still
get forward, they are busie rather then dangerous; but if
they be checked in their desires they become secretly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and looke vpon men and matters with an euill eye; and
if they rise not with their seruice, they will take order to
make their seruice fall with them.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="9"/>
to</hi> Cardinall Perron) not at all to shake hands with
<hi>Rome,</hi> whiles her whordomes and withcrafts yet remaine
in such abundance.</p>
   <p>My wish and hearty prayer to God is, and I think
not mine alone, but of all good men, neither would
I account my life deare to be spent in the furtherance
of it, that the miserable rent, and wide woundes,
which at this day wee see in the Christian world, in
matter of Religion, might by some good meanes be
closed vp, for the sparing of the effusion of so much
Christian blood, the securing of the Crownes of
Christian Princes, the setling of so great distraction
in Christian mindes, the wiping away of the scandall
of diuision, from the Christian profession, and lastly
resisting with vnited forces, the common enemie of
the blessed and glorious name of Iesus Christ: But as
long as the<note n="9" place="margin">See the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the state of religion in these Westerne parts which it were much to be wished, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himselfe would perfect and publish.</note> Bishop of
Rome shal hang the faith of his
followers on this Principle [<hi>I and my Church cannot
possibly erre</hi>] and with the same stoppe the mouths of
all his opposites, bee the force and euidence of their
arguments neuer so cleare and stronge; I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
otherwise of such a wish then of an honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but without any apparent hope of successe. For
if diuine authoritie doe concurre with them in all
their ordinances, if Gods Spirit infallibly assist them
in all their decisions, what remaines there, but only
that they teach, wee beleeue, they command, and
the world obey? Indeed in humane gouernments
where reason is shut out, there tyrannie is thrust in;
but where God commandeth, to aske a reason, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
to disobey, rebellion: to this miserable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
haue their assertions tied them which they
<pb n="15" facs="9"/>
haue laid for their eternall foundation; miserable to
themselues, and miserable to the whole world; nay,
in so many conferences as haue beene held in this age
for pacification, it hath beene truely obserued, that
ere they parted, they plainely discouered, they came
not with any such intent, as to yeeld any thing for
<hi>Peace,</hi> much lesse for <hi>Trueths</hi> sake, but onely to assay
either by perswasion to reduce, or otherwise by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to intrap and disgrace their aduersaries; and if
some one of them haue shewed himselfe more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
at any time, it hath beene his vtter disgrace with
his owne partie for euer after. Now for the manner
of mine answering, I haue set downe his text at large
in his owne words, without altering or adding so
much as a sillable (except it were to make sense where
I found none) imputing the errour thereof to the
Printer, rather then the Author, I haue followed the
Methode of his owne diuision, for the most part, both
in the <hi>Chapters &amp; Sect.</hi> The maine scope of euery <hi>Sect.</hi>
I haue answered in the bodie of my Reply, stretching
the force of his Arguments, sometimes beyond the
extent of the Letter; &amp; such extrauagant matters, as
he drawes in vpon the bye, I thought it sufficient to
reply vnto, in my marginall notes, so that in one of the
two, nothing I thinke worth the answering hath es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
vnanswered; and I shall craue that curtesie of
the Reader, if he receiue not satisfaction in the one,
to haue recourse to the other; and this I take to bee
faire and iust dealing without exception; once I am
sure I haue dealt with him as my selfe in like case
should desire to be dealt withall, which I take to bee
the safest rule of iust dealing. Surely a matter it is of

thinke, he rather wrote it that the title might be seen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
in the common Catalogue, then that the Booke it
selfe might commonly bee read; in regarde that the
worke is so slender, and the copies so few, that as it is
scarce to be had, so is it scarce worth the reading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had: himselfe professeth that he wrote it [<hi>Ne mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni

Lest men should thinke some great matter lay hidden
in that booke, which no man had confuted:] but hee
that shall compare both, may well say, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his answere, that no man hath yet confuted it.</p>
   <p>Somewhat more wisely and warily hath he dealt
with <hi>Casaubons Exercitations,</hi> answering onely the
fourth chapter of his first <hi>Exercitation,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a whole volume to follow after against the rest,
in imitation belike of <hi>Richard Stanihurst,</hi> who hath
published his flourish to a future combate with his

full encounters both of the one and the other, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

An easie matter it is to promise great matters, but not
so easie to performe them being promised: For mine
owne part, I must confesse, I haue made a larger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
then either the treatise answered deserued, or
the state of my bodie, and my leisure (being to make
so often returnes from a remote part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to mine attendance in Court) could well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or indeed my selfe at first proiected; but I haue
now found it true in mine owne experience, which I
haue often heard obserued by others, to fall out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times in writing, as it doth in building: many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
and additions present themselues, besides,
and beyond the first designe. It was written of <hi>Fame,</hi>
but it may as truely be said of this kind of writing,
<q>Vires acquirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>undo.</q>
It gathers strength in going, as in eating a man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gets a stomack: which was the reason (together
with an expectation, that either some more able pen
would haue vndertaken this encounter, or some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greater importance promised by the Author
himselfe, and <hi>Pelitier,</hi> would ere this haue beene pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to the world) that mine answere hath beene
differred till now: but if it be well enough, it is soone
enough, how well it is, let the reader iudge, whom
<pb n="18" facs="11"/>
notwithstanding, I shall desire to suspend his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment▪
till hee haue heard both parties speake, which
request mee thinkes is but reasonable, considering I
haue dealt so fauourably with the aduerse party, as
to set downe all at full, that hee could say for
himselfe: With whom, if I deale in mine answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as if hee were still aliue, it is to bee ascribed to
himselfe, who in the conclusion of his Letter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<hi>hee sent his soule therein;</hi> neither is that I haue
done herein without example of those, by whose
greatnesse if need were, small faults might be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced;
it is (I hope) sufficient that I neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
thereby to wrong the dead, or deceiue the
liuing:</p>
   <p>Neither let it bee thought blameable, that being
by profession a diuine, I haue medled so much in
matters of state; it was rather out of the necessitie
of the arguments to bee replied vnto, then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
or disposition of mine owne, farther then to
make it appeare to the world, that the Religion by vs
professed, is more sutable to the preseruation of the
ciuill power, and in speciall the forme of policie esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
among vs, then that religion which dares ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
ours of the contrary; of which I may truely say
that (in the termes it now stands) it doth not so much
vphold temporall policie, as it is vpheld by it, and
yet like the iuie which riseth by clasping the oake,
hath it at length ouertopt the oake of <hi>Soueraigneti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi>
it selfe: whereas on the other side ours hath hitherto
had none other supports, but the meere euidence of
trueth and diuine assistance, and so according to that
receiued principle of nature, being still nourished by
<pb n="19" facs="11"/>
the same meanes as it was first bredde, it makes vs
confident that it will both grow the better and last
the longer. Thus commending thee to Gods grace,
the worke to thy charitable censure, and my selfe to
thy Christian prayers, I rest.</p>
