   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>HOwsoever ther be many vnknown motiues which lead men
in these dayes unto conformitie, yet those which are openly
professed, may be referred either vnto M. Sprints way,
who confesseth the ceremonies to be imposed contrary unto
the rules of Gods word, and yet contendeth that they are to be used in
case of deprivation: Or else to D. Mortons way, who avoucheth the
sayd cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>monies to be agreeable unto the rules of Gods word, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ch as ought to be observed simply. Now he that considereth wel
of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ter, shall find that there is no ground for the conscience to
rest on in either of these wayes. As for M. Sprint, (to speak nothing
of his mis-alledging very many authors) he hath but three main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:
and to all three he hath given sufficient answer himselfe.
His first argument is taken from the doctrine and practise of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
about the Iewish ceremonies. Now all the force of this reason
doth depend upon that paritie or equalitie which is supposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our ceremonies and the Iewish, our ministers warrant and the
Apostles: so that if this paritie faileth, the whole argument falleth.
Yet M. Sprint himselfe confesseth, pag. 250. 256. that those Iewish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
were not every way so evill as ours are: neither doth or dare
he say, that ministers now haue such particular warrant for conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as the Apostles had for applying themselves a little while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some of the Iewish ceremonies.</p>
   <p>His second reason is, that a lesser dutie must yeeld unto a greater.
Now this case by his own cōfession p. 30. doth not hold so, as that a man
should doe a thing formally, simply, and in nature evill, for any good.
Now he knoweth, as appeareth p. 45. that the ceremonies in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
are esteemed such by most of these that now oppose them. So
that this reason can be of no force with them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
His third reason is, because refusall of conformitie in case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
tendeth to condemne in a manner all true Churches which
haue taught and practised otherwise. Hee meaneth by <hi>condemning,</hi>
accusing of error. Now M. Sprint himselfe doth thus condemne all
or the most of the Churches which he alledgeth to haue practised such
ceremonies. For in confessing our ceremonies to be inconvenient, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
evill, such as the urging of them cannot be justified, and yet
affirming that almost all Churches haue appointed and used such, even
out of the case of deprivation or such like necessitie, doth he not plainly
accuse all those Churches of error? These things considered, I thought
is needless to spend much time in examining M. Sprints booke any
further. But according to your desire, I will shew you mine opinion in
briefe concerning the chiefe passages which are in Thomas Chesters, or
as he was wont to be called, Doctor Mortons Defence of three ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
commonly used in our Churches, which I doe the more
willingly vndertake, because divers things are therin handled of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vse in divinitie, whereof I profess my selfe a Student, though in
the ministerie I cannot find a setled station. But before I come to the
Defence it selfe, first, I would faine vnderstand the reason why
<hi>three Ceremonies</hi> are onely defended, seeing there be many threes of
those things which stay many godly men from subscription and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
as is to be seen even in that abridgement which this Defender
doth chiefly oppose? Is it because our best Prelats haue onely a care to
perswade if it may be, those that are in the ministery, to that conformity
which is most of all noted, not regarding in the meane time, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
of so many godly learned yong men, who not onely for these,
but for divers other corruptions also, are forced to turne away from
the ministerie, whereunto their education, gifts and hearts did carry
them, while many lewd fellowes, the chiefe spots and blots of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
doe possess their places.</p>
   <p>I would know also what the reason should be, that the <hi>innocencie</hi>
onely of these ceremonies is defended? Is this all that is required in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
forcibly obtruded upon ministers and people, even to the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
excommunicating, and uttter undoing of many hundreds? Is this
all, I say, that is required, that such ceremonies be in some sence inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
or not hurtfull? surely not scripture onely, and sound reason, but
common sense will looke for some good necessarie use in such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb facs="3"/>
and not innocencie alone.</p>
   <p>And then what is the sence (trow you) in which these ceremonies
may be called <hi>Innocent?</hi> when Calvin (whom the Defender calleth
an honorable witnes) would devise a charitable title for them, he stiles
them <hi>tolerabiles incptiae,</hi> viz. tolerable fooleries, or fopperies, Epist.
200. &amp; 206. When he speaketh more out of iudgement, hee not onely
calleth them frivoulous and unprofitable, but saith plainlie that their
proper name is hurtfull, noxious, or nocent, cleane contrarie to this
Defendants language. Surely one of these writers, not differing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but flatly opposing and contradicting the other, must needs be farre
wide.</p>
   <p>Innocent indeed these ceremonies may be called in regard of their
materials, and the fashions also which they haue in their naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for the cloth of a Surpless and the fashion of it is innocent, and
so are all the idols of Papists and Heathens verie innocent: so that
this is no praise. But if we look at the use whereunto they haue been
applyed, and wherein they haue beene a long time employed, I may
truely say by the devill, not onely among the Papists, but even in our
Churches, to the breeding of dissention and distraction among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron,
to quenching of many, and many a burning shining light, to the
grieving and unsetling of so many good soules, and to the advancing
of the Kingdome of darkeness: If these things I say be considered,
then it is more then manifest, that this licking them over with a fair
word will make them no more innocent indeed then Pilats hands
were when they were washed. The fashion of a Surplice naturall or
artificiall in another use, as if a Porter or Baker weare such a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is indifferent.</p>
   <p>If it shall be said, that notwithstanding these accidentall abuses,
yet the ceremonies are innocent in their own nature and use: I answer,
first, they having no necessary use otherwaies, and these being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
effects which haue followed on them, there is no rule of Logick
much less of zeale that will allow the Defendant simply to call them
innocent. 2 It is a shame for our Prelates to talk of the ceremonies
innocencie, when they cannot defend their own innocencie in obtruding
and urging of them. They are wont to say, the practise and manner
of urging we will not defend, but the lawfulness or innocencie of the
things themselues. Indeed for a private man to stand upon such
<pb facs="4"/>
termes is tolerable: but for the Prelates, whose hands are chiefe in
this trespass, to cover their owne guiltiness under figleaved innocencie
of three ceremonies, is too too grosse. If Thomas or D. Morton in
times past had pleaded for the ceremonies innocencie, it might haue been
well interpreted: but for Thomas Chester, Thomas Lichfild, or any
that bear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th a Cathedrall name, to write of the innocencie of three ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
passing by three hundred foule nocencies which are plainly
to be seen in the Prelates urging and managing of these ceremonies,
this is somewhat like as if Samson when he had sent Foxes with fire-brands
in their tailes among the corn, should then haue written unto
the owners of that corne a long letter concerning the innocencie of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes
and Fire-brands.</p>
   <p>Thirdly and lastly, it is sufficiently proved, and shall (by Gods
grace) be further maintained against this Defendant, that these
three ceremonies are not innocent or lawfull in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se.</p>
   <p>This I had to say concerning the Title. Now before I come to the
book it selfe, some few things are to be questioned in the Epistles,
which are three, according to the number of the ceremonies defended.
In the first Epistle to the Marquis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> I would willingly learn, what
that Church is, which is the mother of the Non-conformists? it must
of necessitie be either the faithfull Congregations which are in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
collectiuely considered: or else the Hierarchie, consisting of
Archbishops, Bishops and their Officers. If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ormer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
then this Defence is begunne with a Slander. For neither is
the Non-conformist an adversarie impugning those Congregations, nor
doe they defame their religious worship, nor infringe their wholesome
libertie, nor contemne their just authoritie: but of all these things are
the Prelates manifestly guiltie. For they in their Lordly humours, doe
scorne and defame the most religious people as Puritanes: they hinder
the people from hearing of Sermons in another parish, though they haue
none, or worse then none at home: they are enemies to that preaching
wherby the godly people finde themselues most edified: they inslaue
both Minister and people, not onely to themselues, but even to their
Chancellors, Commissaries, officials, and such like officers of their own
making, to whom not Christ onely, but all the Primitiue Church saith
plainely, Depart from me I know you not: they denie anie authoritie
at all to be either in the Congregations, or in their Ministers, except it
<pb facs="4"/>
be a little of courtesie from the Ordinarie. These things are so well
known, that they need no proofe.</p>
   <p>If by the Church heer be meant the Hierarhie, then wee profess
plainely we acknowledge no such mother. She is a Step-dams, usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this title and authoritie, without all warrant from God our Father.
Shee is a creature of mans making, and may more lawfullie be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when it pleaseth man, then ever she was by him crected.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I marvaile with what conscience this man can spend a
great part of his Epistle in stirring up a Courtier unto the opposing of.
Non-conformists? As if this were a great point of admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and zeale, as he calleth it: and the Courtiers such, as stood in
most need of instigations to the zeale of Formalitie, being otherwise
for substance such as they should be.</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, what agreement is there in this Argument, to conjure a
man by the obligation of his Baptisme, to stand for the defence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ceremonies? was he baptized into the faith of the cermonies?
or is he bound to maintaine everie ceremonie which men haue brought
into that Church where he was baptized? If he were conjured by his
Bishoping to such things as these, there would be more reason in the
consequence.</p>
   <p>Fourthlie, what need is there that great men should be called to aide
and assist the Prelats against Non-conformists? haue they not power
enough in their own hands? can they not at their own pleasure suspend,
depriue, excommunicate, &amp; what almost they please? Do they not tread
these poore men under their feet? Is it because that the Prelats cannot
yet sufficientlie prevaile against thē in the consciences of men, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call for further help in vaine? Or is the meaning, that such men
should be helped unto great Bishoprickes, as are most Zealous against
Non-conformists? If this be the matter, I dare say the Petition shall be
granted, and yet the Petitioner, except he make great progresse in this
eagerness, will hardlie get beyond Lichfild, at least not to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie.</p>
   <p>In the second Epistle to the Non-conformists, manie things are jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together, which afterward must be examined, but here cannot.
For this Epistle taketh the whole book for unanswerable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should rather haue been set at the end then at the beginning: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie
one ridiculous piece of Rhetorick is to be touched, wherein (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
<pb facs="5"/>
the Non-conformists aboue all their other faults wherewith
they are usuallie charged and loaded, are now as it were lovinglie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to acknowledge themselues guiltie of superstition. The reason
is rendred, because there is a negatiue superstition, the formall cause
whereof is the forbearing and forbidding of things lawfull as unholy
and profane: and the Non-conformists haue such negatiue opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as kneel not, cross not, weare not, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>All this is nothing else but a trick of prevention usuall with craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
men, who choose to lay that upon their adversaries which they know
more properly to belong unto themselues. But I would that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
or rather Accusant, had given us some plaine reason of his
new opinion, there is no definition of superstition, properly so called,
that will father this conclusion. The Schoolemen doe with one consent
place superstition in a kind of excess of Religions worship, Thom. 2. 2.
q. 92. art. 1, from whom in this point our Divines doe not dissent.
Now though this excess do seem sometims to consist in a negation, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
excess or errour in negation, is never called by any author that ever writ
(I dare say) superstition, when he meaneth to speake properly, except
that very negation, abstinence or forbearing be held as a special worship.
Now in the Non-conformists there is no such thing to be found: they
doe not abstaine from these Ceremonies, but as they doe from other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
corruptions. Suppose they erre, yet everie erronious deniall of
things lawfull is not superstition.</p>
   <p>The Defendant therefore heere being overhastie to charge his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
considered not well what weapon he choose. But if he had
well remembred what is said of superstition, not onely by our Divines,
but even by some of the Papists themselues, he would haue forborne to
make mention of this word. For our Divines, let honourable Calvin
speak, Iust. l. 1 c. 12. s. 1 <hi>Inde mihi videtur dicta superstitio,
quod modo &amp; praescripta ratione non contenta supervacuam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
congeriem accumulet.</hi> Papists thus. <hi>Superstitio est</hi> (saith
<hi>Azorius Inst. mor. l. 9 c. 11) cum quis Deo cultu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> tribuit ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
&amp; vanum, scil. commentitia &amp; futili aliqua caeremonia eum
venerando, vel cum quis Deum honorat falsis vanis, &amp; frivolis ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniis,
id est,</hi> As Swarez doth in a manner interpret it, <hi>quando
honor Dei in iis rebus ponitur, quibus revera non colitur, ut in cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s
superfluis, &amp; ad salutem animae nihil conferentibus.</hi>
If this touch not the Defendant, I would desire him to peruse what
<pb facs="5"/>
Mr. Parker hath written concerning the superstition of the Crosse,
and giue some answer to the same, before he threaten any more such
kindness as this is upon the Nonconformists.</p>
   <p>Another thing also is by a figure of praetermition ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nuated in
this Epistle, not unworthie consideration, viz. that many Parliaments
and Convocations haue established these rites. To this I answer, 1 the
Prelats in such matters as these, haue no respect unto the authoritie of
Parliaments. For they frame Canons, urge and excute them with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut
the consent of any Parliament, nay flatly against them. For so
wee reade in the Records of that worthie Parliament which was ann:
1610. <hi>Among the Canons late made by the Clergie of England
in their Convocation, it vvas thought that some of their Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ns
did extend to charge the bodies, lands, and goods of the subjects of
the Realme, further then vvas lawfull and meet. We therefore
made a good law to make voide such Canons as doe charge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
lands, and goods of the subjects, unlesse that the same canons
vvere confirmed by Parliament.</hi> 2 The Defendant cannot bring
forth one Act of Parliament now in force, that doth allow of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
and Conformitie to be urged as now it is by the Prelats. This
appeareth by the judgement of the foresaid Parliament in those words
of their petition, where they complaine, That <hi>diverse painfull and
learned Pastors that haue long travelled in the vvork of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
vvith good fruit and blessing of their labours, vvho vvere
ever readie to performe the legall Subscription, appointed by the
Statute of 13 Eliz. which onely concerneth the Confession of the
true Christian Faith, and doctrine of the Sacraments, yet for not
conforming in some points of Ceremonies, and refusing the
Subscription directed by the late Canons, haue been removed
from their Ecclesiasticall livings, being their freehold, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from all meanes of maintenance, to the great griefe of sundry
well-affected Subjects.</hi> 3 It is well known that the Prelates
themselues in their proceedings about these matters, doe so farre vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Statutes of Parliament, that they are by law subject unto a
Praemunire.</p>
   <p>Now as for Convocations, not to dispute here what manner of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
they be, 1 It is well known that they consist now of a Faction,
and that in memorie of man, they never concluded any thing for the
common good of the Church more then by others was better done to their
hands: but much evill hath come from among them, and more would
<pb facs="6"/>
but that many times their commission serveth not but onely to giue
Subsidies, and then to tell the clock. 2 They are servile to those on
whom they depend, and tirannicall over the poore that are subject unto
them: 3 there are verie few that haue place in them which are not gross
offenders against the most ancient Canons. As for example, it
was observed that in that Convocation which established and revived
these corruptions, of 300 or 400, there were not aboue twise three,
which were not, or had not been gross Non-residents or Pluralists.
D. Morton himselfe, in a Latine Sermon had before a Convocation
some 8 yeares since, described well the most part of them (though
he did not speak distinctlie of the number) to be unsavorie salt. For
he gaue us three notes whereby corrupt Ministers in England might
be discerned. 1 That they studied chieflie and stuft their Sermons
with Friers and Iesuits: 2 that they sought occasions to disgrace Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin:
and 3 that if anie neighbour Minister be more diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
then they, they brand him straight with the name of Puritan.
These notes are well known to agree unto most of our convocated Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
4 The authoritie of this Convocation either against or without
consent of Parliament, is not to be regarded, much less against the
Scriptures.</p>
   <p>In the Epistle to the Reader, this onelie I would inquire of, what
is the reason, that seeing he choose to himselfe for <hi>Cheife Opposites,</hi>
the Lincolneshire Ministers, he doth not deale with all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor the twentieth part of their Allegations, but onelie with such
as he thought fittest for his purpose? Of this I will not saie all. But
this I maie not omit, that considering he knew how much hath
been said against the Ceremonies by them and others, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
by M. Parker, which he never attempted to
answer, neither hee, nor others for him, had
anie cause to triumph in this booke,
as in a compleate
Defense.</p>
