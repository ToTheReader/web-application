      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN, at his first creation, had a reasonable soule, (the very breath of God) infused into him: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in original iustice (the image of God) was most liuely and louely by Gods hand engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Hereby, al the powers of the soule were per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">
         <desc>••••</desc>
      </gap> and accomplished in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being both able and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite, for the orderly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their functions. The reason and vnderstanding
<pb facs="3"/> were cleare; the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ordinate; the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall faculties, not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from euil, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to be seruiceable to good. So that reason had full power and dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the will, and the wil did gouern the sensual appetites; being the mean to hold thē in obedience vnto reason.</p>
   <p>But when, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> originall iustice was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lost; when the image of God was defaced in man; reason, which is the life of the soule, was much enfeebled; the will was disordered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued; the sensual powers
<pb facs="4"/> did tumult, and breake loose from their obedience: and haue euer since run to their obiects, with so violent a course, that commonly they draw the will after them. which also flattereth feeble reason (as <hi>Eue</hi> entised <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) to taste of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit; euen to submit it selfe to the seruice of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; partly, in contriuing means for accōplishing that which it doth affect; &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in framing, either iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or excuse, or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the same. So that then, the first order of subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; rule being inuerted,
<pb facs="4"/> or rather peruerted, subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euerted in the soule; the sensuall faculties had full dominion ouer the will; and the will did gouern &amp; guide reason; being the meane to holde it in obedience vnto sence.</p>
   <p>And although after our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> regeneration, reason, with assistance of the wil, first ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, then directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by grace, recouereth such power ouer the sensuall faculties, that it may (in some degree) and often doth reduce them to the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their obedience; yet for the most part it happeneth,
<pb facs="5"/> that it is, either weake or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to execute this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: &amp; that especially for two causes.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The first is, for that the will, which is placed between reason and sensualitie, and apt to be applied to eyther, contracteth the first famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity (which commonly is most firme) with sensuality. And this is done, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our childish age, and partly also in the yeeres of our youth, in which time the will is guided by sence and is little or nothing commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reason. Whereuppon it followeth that the passions
<pb facs="5"/> of sensuality, being by long custome, strong, familiar, &amp; pleasant to the will; and the first motions of reason, by reason of nouelty, weake, strange and distastefull: it geueth it selfe fully to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of sence, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes hardly recouered, to breake that amity▪ and to knit into acquaintance with reason.</p>
   <p>The second cause is, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that the sence giueth present payment of a certain shadow or shewe of good; namely, of some sensual cōmodity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: but the reward of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the true essentiall good
<pb facs="6"/> which reason promiseth, and faith assureth, for a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and godly cariage of our liues, is vpō a day: nothing in presēt, but onely hope, &amp; some small earnest of the promise. Now, although wee knowe that there is no comparison betweene these in valewe, yet this false shew in such sort bewitcheth the will, that it is content to entertaine and embrace the present appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to desist from pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sute of the true future good. And thus the will being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, and drawne downe to the loue of those thinges which are pleasing to the
<pb facs="6"/> sence, reason is eyther soe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereby, that it is caried in the same course of sensuality, or else remaineth so deiected in power, that it is altogether vnable to restrain the same. Eyther the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so blinded, that it cannot discerne what it ought to doe: or the strength so disabled, that it cannot doe that which it doeth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and iudge fitte to bee done.</p>
   <p>Now, to correct this natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall eyther weakenesse or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of the powers of the soule, and to retaine them in that order of obedience
<pb facs="7"/> and commaund, which is not onely iust but expedient for the soule: three exercises of Religion are, both proper, and also necessarie: fasting, medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, and prayer. Fasting, to breake the power of sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie; meditation, to stir vp and strengthen the forces of reason; prayer to inuocate &amp; implore grace; which onely is able to rectifie the will, &amp; to curbbe and controule the sensuall appetites.</p>
   <p>The first of these, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an exercise of the body; the other two are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the soule. Fasting may oftentimes be seperated from
<pb facs="7"/> meditation and prayer; and is then only to be vsed, when the body is therby made more seruiceable to the soule But meditation and prayer are inseperable twinnes; like those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> which did feede together, sleepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ioy together, weepe together, liue together, die together: or like a paire of turtles; whereof one being taken away, the other will first languish, and afterwards die.</p>
   <p>Prayer disposeth our soules to meditation; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation supplieth matter to our prayer; both giue strēgth
<pb facs="8"/> and life, the one to the other.</p>
   <p>Meditation prepareth our soules, and maketh them fit to receiue God; prayer in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiteth that glorious guest; both do entertaine him, and make him pleased therein to abide.</p>
   <p>Prayer is the speach of the soule vnto God; Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is the speech of God to the soule; both make a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conference and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing betweene God and the soule.</p>
   <p>For this cause I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured, in framing these deuotions (which are the best accompt that I can yeelde to
<pb facs="8"/> the worlde of my Sabbaoth dayes employmentes) so to entermixe meditation and prayer, that they may seeme, as it were, twisted into one thredde. Alwaies to begin, and to end our meditation with prayer; oftentimes in the middest of meditation to breake into prayer; somtimes in the middest of prayer to pause vppon meditation. Which course, how comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it may bee to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and soules of other men, I doe not certainely know, I could but only make thereof coniecture by my selfe.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>What hath beene my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance herein, I wil ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extenuate nor extoll. There is nothing, but the goodnesse of God, which I will extoll; there is nothing, but my owne weakenes, which I will extenuate and excuse. For other particular passages let them extol, who are priuy to their owne negligence, &amp; want of paines; let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, who will make others priuie to the same. Onely, I will adde a few wordes for aunswere to those, who make light estimation of these and the like labours, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, that they are collected
<pb facs="9"/> out of other Authors.</p>
   <p>First, this argument hauing been so long, so often, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and yet neuer sufficientlie handled, and to the worth, it is impossible that much should bee saide therein, whereof much hath not been spoken by others. And yet the varietie may bee exceeding great. Euen as the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wood and of stone, is neither polished nor fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all buildinges alike.</p>
   <p>Secondly, it is accounted our nicenesse, or rather neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this pointe, wherby many writinges are like vnto the plant <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/> which springe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth and fadeth in one day. Whereas in all faculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, their writings haue stood for longest continuance, who haue made fairest vse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors. For my own eyther iudgement or opinion, as I do nothing the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew the Spiders webbe, for that she draweth it out of her owne bowels; so doe I not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the lesse of the honey combe, because it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of many flowers.</p>
