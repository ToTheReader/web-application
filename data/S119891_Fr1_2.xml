   <head>TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS AND NOBLE LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the Ladie Crofts, wife to my worthie Patron, Sir Iohn Crofts of Saxham: all comfort in the mercies and grace of God.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Madam, I send you what I preached, not long since, in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and deuout audience, vpō speciall occasion. For such is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the curiositie or religion of Hearers, that sometime they will haue vs preach in print. He that could do it well, in one sense, were a man fit for this age; though in my sense, it is fitter for many then for my selfe: who knowing mine owne imperfections, and the different operation of a mouing voyce and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse letters, am therfore naturally timorous of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like censures; and had kept my lines within doores if either importunitie had not inticed them abroad, or I had not feared their stealing out at a back dore. Now, as they are, I commend them to your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb facs="3"/>it hauing bene, time out of mind, a courtesie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Presse, to take vp the Passe where it best affects. When I liued farre remote, Sir Iohn Crofts, your husband, my worthie and louing Patrone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer seene me, sent and called me to the place I haue: since which time it hath pleased both <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>you selfe,</hi> and your <hi>Noble children,</hi> and my <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable LADIE CHEANY</hi> (with whom you liued in the straitest band of loue vntill God, by a blessed death, in her ripe age, tooke her to his mercie) so much to fauour me, that thereby I haue bene the better both encouraged and enabled to my studies, which were falling to the ground for want of means. And if that were not, yet what I haue seene since, in the course of your life, and the order of your family, were enough to binde all good minds, that honour Vertue, vnto you; whose zeale to <hi>Religion,</hi> and loue to <hi>Learning,</hi> and continuall <hi>exercise</hi> therein both by <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>practise,</hi> ioyned with such promptnes of <hi>memorie</hi> and <hi>modestie</hi> in speaking, giues you interest in all either Learned, or Godly, &amp; makes you worthy of more then my poore words can attribute. Saint Ierome commends a Ladie because she made her daughters and gentlewomen that were about her <hi>daily to reade and learne somewhat out of the Scripture:</hi> a kind of commendation now
<pb facs="3"/>worne out of fashion, like a sute of apparell of the old make: yet your Ladiship hath not refused it; that he who hath seene your children and attendants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, priuate, at worke, hath doubted which were the worke; the Reading of some, while others were working, or the working of others while some were reading. Which parts men obseruing in persons of your ranke, haue taken libertie, without all feare, and freely, to speake thereof; and the wisest that haue bene, such as Ignatius, Chrysostome, Ierome, Basil, Nazianzen, Saint Paul himselfe and the holy Euangelists, haue mentioned them; and more then mentioned them; left vs those memorials of them that the Church of God could not haue spared: as may be seene by their affectionate writing of, and to, the <hi>Maries, Lydia, Lois, Eunice, Cassobolites, Olympias, Laeta, Demetrias, Paula, Eusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium, Celantia, Saluina,</hi> and diuers more; whose vertues therein mentioned are a great part of that which hath taught and giuen example to noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in all ages since. For <hi>coniugal loue, mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pietie, matronly grauitie, wisedome, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, humilitie, hospitalitie, vertue,</hi> shall be both registred, and commended, and imitated, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the contrarie shall be contemned in the greatest, and, now and then, sent downe to the graue
<pb facs="4"/>with a peale of satyres. Go forward then and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what God hath giuen you; and as these things are yours in an eminent manner, so hold them fast, and value them aboue your husbands state, or your patronage: much more aboue glittering apparell and worldly pleasures, and those vanities and excesses where with so manie please themselues and no bodie else. And as here they yeeld you honor and respect, so in Death (which determines all our actions, and layes the pleasures of sinne vpon Gods cold earth) you shall taste the benefite thereof: for the delights of the flesh, and the pride of life, will poison the graue; but the feare of God shall be recompenced with <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Eternall life:</hi> which things are daily behight vnto you, your godly husband, and vertuous children, in his praiers to God,</p>
