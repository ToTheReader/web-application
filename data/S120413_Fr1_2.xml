      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat auncient Poet Lucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
was wont to say, that
neither learned nor vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
should read any of his
doinges: for that the one,
was too ignorant to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
his true meaning: &amp; the other too
wise for him to aunsweare their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Reading of bookes is aptly compared
to eating of cheese: the talant whereof, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
so diuers in taste: as amongst ten men,
two, can hardly agree in one iudgement.
One saith it is too fresh: another thinkes it
too salt: It is too milde (sayth he.) nay sayth
his fellow, it is too strong of the rennet for
me. In like manner, my SVMMONS
FOR SLEEPERS was no sooner pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
abroad: but it seemed to haue four
seuerall rellishes. First, it pleased the wise
and learned: courteously to pardon my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
accept my good will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
all things to the best. The second sort:
iudged it, rather to proceede from naturall
or arteficiall giftes, then spirituall or diuine
grace. The third company: finding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="3"/>
not fitting their fancy: begā maliciously
to discredite and deface, both the author
and the booke. The man in his yong time
(quoth they) delighted too much in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
shooting, and good fellowship, to be
studious or learned, &amp; therefore sure it is but
some od, vaine conceit, vnworthy the view.
The fourth crew, forasmuch as it was not
correspōdent to their owne seditious vaine:
condemned it straight for no better then
playne Papistry. Thus to recompence my
painefull labours, seeking in some measure
to discharge my duety, &amp; profite my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
the whole race of my former life was
called in question: ript vp as an anotomy, &amp;
tost from post to piller, as a tennis-ball.
Whereuppon I haue taken occasion, not to
rip and lay open, the conditions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that vncharitable brotherhood: for
loathing of honest eares, or vncouering their
shame to the enemy: but rather to spend a
little more time in my old pastime of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Not the wyly Fox, nor harmeles Hare:
but that seuen headed monster Antichrist of
Rome: &amp; the three headed Cerberus, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog
of Hell, and his whelpes: the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sectes of Seditious Scismatikes, sprung
vp in our time: dayly barking against the
<pb facs="3"/>
most Christian and well reformed Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
state of the Church of England. Who
seeke together continually, like ramping &amp;
roaring lions, with tooth and naile: to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour
our God, extinguish his Gospell, &amp;
&amp; deuour hys poore saintes. Not with cries
of yelping hounds, to fray thē: nor strength
of coursing grey-hounds to chace them: nor
fangs of rauening mastiffes to baite them:
but the sound of godly Patriarkes, valiant
Prophets, couragious Apostles, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
successours to destroy them: the
breath of Gods holy spirite, to subuert and
utterly confound them: and the two edged
sword of his eternall woord, to pierce and
thrust them thorough, euen to the diuiding
a sunder of their iointes and marow. Besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
thee in curtesy gentle Reader, to iudge
charitably, censure wythout partialitye,
make choice to thy profite, &amp; yeld God the
glory. <hi>Vale in Christo.</hi> Leonard Wright.</p>

      </gap>
found, and my selfe haue
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>gested. To whose spiteful obiections,
<pb facs="4"/>
though wisdome do will me, not to cast a
stone at euery barking dog: yet must I needes
in mine owne defence say somewhat.</p>
   <p>First, as touching the title of learning, I
reuerently yeeld it ouer to my betters, that
woorthily deserue it: hauing nothing my
selfe to boast vppon,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 29.</note> but painefull crosses,
grieuous afflictions,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>. Cor. 12. 6. 9.</note> sicknes of body, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of mind, and wreastling with want &amp;
necessity. Beseeching God to graunt me pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and his holy spirite, to vse in some
measure, that little I haue conceiued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the holy scriptures, and learned mens
bookes. Exhorting all men euen in christian
charity, and the feare of God: That though
it were as simple a scholer as Balaam asse,
that shall iustly reproue your wicked beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,<note place="margin">Num. 22.</note>
and tell you the trueth: do not strike
him, but go about your owne amendment:
least you seeme to kicke against the prickes,
or stryue with God:<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> who will neyther bee
mockt, nor dallied withall.</p>
   <p>Touching my recreation, I aunsweare
with Spiridion Bishop of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>
demaunded why hee durst <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="4"/>
quoth he, because I am a christian. So dare I
freely hunt and shoote, for my health and
recreation, intime, place, &amp; company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient:
because I am a christian: &amp; know
how to vse them, without offence towards
God,<note place="margin">Etheickes lib. 4.</note> or abuse to my neighbour. <hi>Requies &amp;
ludus, in vita necessari<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> saith Aristotle. Both the
body and the mind, are sometimes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
with playes, saith Peter Martyr: to
make vs afterwards more prompt vnto gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
matters.<note place="margin">vpon the Iudges <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> For as there is a time to weepe
and mourne,<note place="margin">Preach. 3. Rom. 12. 15</note> so is there a time to laugh and
be merry. When God sent the prophet to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his people of Ierusalem: amongst others
his mercies, he promised them this security:
that their boyes and damsels,<note place="margin">Zach. 8. 5.</note> should sport
and play in the streetes. Mirth, ioy, prayse,
and thankesgeuing,<note place="margin">Esay. 51.</note> shall be heard in Syon,
sayth the Lord. Defraud not thy neighbour
of his liberty,<note place="margin">Eccle. 7.</note> saith Iesus Syrach: neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
him in his mirth. Take thy pastime at
home,<note place="margin">31.</note> and do what thou wilt (sayth he) so
thou do none euill.<note place="margin">32.</note> When thou hast dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thy duety,<note place="margin">Esay 65.</note> sairh the prophet: sit downe
with the people and be merry. The Apostle
himselfe exhorteth men,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 17.</note> to loue and delight
<pb facs="5"/>
in brotherly fellowship. And daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
teacheth, that honest pastime, is a
great occasion of frendly meetinges, And
neighbourly conference, the cognisance of
humane society: A meane to foster and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
concorde and amitye amongst men.
Whereas the contrary do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h rather engender
melancholike hatred and disdaine. As for
such grim churlish Timons, curious Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
hipocrites, and wayward scrupulous
fooles: whose willes are too obstinate for
their sences: their wittes too headstrong for
their wisdome: and their dumpish natures,
too peeuish, to enter league with reason:
Are more fit to liue in Diogenes tub, or Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonius
denne: then for humane society,
amongst honest men. And wot you what
Master Tusser saith: There is oftentimes sene
no more very a knaue: then hee that doth
counterfait most to be graue.</p>
