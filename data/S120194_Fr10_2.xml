   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ertue is not loued enough, because she is not seene; and 틀ice loseth much detestation, because her vglinesse is secret. Certainly, my Lords, there are so many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so many graces in the face of Goodnesse, that no eye can possibly see it without affection, without rauishment: and the visage of Euill is so monstrous through loathsome deformities, that if her louers were not ignorant, they would be mad with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and astonishment. What need we more than to discouer these two to the world? This worke shall saue the labour of exhorting, and disswasion. J haue here done it as I could, following that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Master of Morality,<note place="margin">Theophrastus.</note> who thought this the fittest taske for the ninety and ninth yeere of his age, and the profitablest monument that he could leaue for a fare-well to his Grecians. Loe here then 틀ertue and 틀ice stript naked to the open view, and despoiled, one of her rags, the other of her ornaments, and nothing left them but bare presence to pleade for affection: see now whether shall finde more suters. And if still the vaine mindes of lewd men shall dote vpon their old mistresse, it will appeare to be, not because she is not foule, but for that they are blinde, and bewitched. And first behold the goodly features of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> an amiable vertue, and worthy to leade this Stage: which as she extends her selfe to all the following <hi>Graces,</hi> so amongst the rest is for her largenesse most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous.</p>
