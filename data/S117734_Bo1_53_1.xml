   <p>I Could haue soyled a greater volume then this with a deale of emptie and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiall
scuffe: as puling Sonets, whining Elegies, the dog-trickes of Loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="4 letters">
         <desc>••••</desc>
      </gap>
to mocke Apes, and transforme men into Asses. Which kind of writing is
like a man in Authoritie, ancient in yeares, rouerend in Beard, with a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out-side of Wisedome and Grauitie, yet in the expected performances of
his profound vnder standing, his capacitie speakes nething but <hi>Mutimus,</hi>
But heere your Worships shall find no such stuffe: for thou I haue not done as
I should, yet I haue performed as much as I could. I haue not had riuers of
Oyle, or fountaines of wine to fill this my poore caske or booke: but I haue
(as it were) extracted oyle out of steels, and wine out of dry chaffe. I haue here of a graine of <hi>Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed</hi>
made a mountaine greater then the <hi>Apenines</hi> or <hi>Caucalus,</hi> and not much lesser then the whole
world. Here is Labour, Profit, Cloathing, Pleasure, Food, Nauigation: Diuinitie, Poetry, the liberall
Arts, Armes, Vertues defence, Vices offence, a true mans protection, a Thiefes execution. Here is mirth
and matter all beaten out of this small Seed.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>With all, my selfe for my selfe, and in the behalfe of Mr.</hi> Roger Bird, <hi>doe most humbly thanke your
Worships for many former vndeserued courtesies and fauours extended towards vs, especially at our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our dangerous Voyage in the Paper boat: for which wee must euer acknowledge our selues bound to
your Goodnesses. Which voyage I haue merrily related at the end of this Pamphlet, which with the rest
I haue made bold to dedicate to your Worshipfull and worthy Patronages, humbly desiring your pardons
and acceptances, euer remaining to bee commanded by yon and yours in all obsequiousnesse.</hi>
