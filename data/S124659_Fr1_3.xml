   <head>To the Christian <hi>Reader.</hi>

   <p>COnsidering that the profanation of the Lordes holy Sabbaoth is one of the generall and capitall sinnes of the lande, which not a little provoketh the high displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and deepe vengeance of God against our whole Nation, for that wheresoever it goeth, it is accompanied with the contempt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, pietie, and good order, to the letting in of Poperie, Atheisme, impietie, and all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I doubt not (good Reader) but thou wilt easily confesse, that it is high time for euerie man to put to his helping hand for the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or at least, for the abating (if it may be) of this high contempt of the Lords day. And to vse all good meanes, whereby those which yet sinne of ignorance, and weakenesse, rather then of any setled wilfulnesse, may be brought in some measure to the sound knowledge, and holy obedience of this most glorious comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. That so (at the least) for their sakes so fearing God, and in his feare drawing neare vnto his true worship (which yet are likely, no doubt, to proue the smallest number) the Lord may in his mercie spare the whole land, as he spared ripe sinning Sodome, for iust
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Lots</hi> sake. To which end and purpose, it hath pleased God to stirre vp many of his servants, both godly and learned, to trauel, both by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and writing in the former argument. And among the rest,
<note place="margin">D Bound. Ma. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Ma. Widly.</note> some have laboured as I suppose (without preiudice to any be it spoken) more abundantly then the rest, and that both learnedly and godly, having soundly prooved the doctrine by authoritie of the worde, and consent of the best Writers, and consent both of antiquitie, and of later yeares, as also vrged the same by many religious and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall perswasions vnto the conscience. For whose painfull trauels I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe (the least of all) amongst many other most highly bound to give God praise. But such is the corruption of our nature in generall, (but especially of the sluggard, to whom a few lines more then ordinarie in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters, seeme to be so many Lions ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his way to keepe him from reading the same) that few of many will hardly take the paines to travaile to the ende of any learned discourse, though it be likely to prove never so profitable vnto them at their iourneyes end And many againe are induced rather to read such things as are short and compendious, like
<pb facs="7"/>men that love to goe the nearest way home with a light burthen. In which respects I have presumed to offer vnto thee this short a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the doctrine of the Sabbaoth: partly to thrust on the sluggard, and partly to toll on the wearie and faint, and partly to helpe the memories of those that have read and forgot againe: but chiefly to stirre vp them with my selfe to a more carefull and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practise of the same. Herein know that I have but imitated those travellers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene in other Countreys, have made a briefe collection of such things as they have observed, and deemed memorable: telling the world of many a faire Citie which they never builded, of many a goodly Orchard which they never planted, of many stately Monuments which they never erected, and of many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workes which they never invented, &amp;c. And all this yet, not without some comfort to themselves, and some delight to others, &amp; not without some provocation perhaps vnto some to take the like, or greater iourneys to their further benefite and delight: having learned, that if a man doe but even speake the same things againe, which have beene spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not altogether a fruitles labour. If I
<pb facs="8"/>have added of mine owne (as in some places I have) though verie little, and followed mine owne Method and order in the contriving of this poore ahridgement. I have not done it without the approbation of many godly and learned, both in the ministerie, and otherwise, (whose iudgement I must, and doe euery way preferre before my owne) who having perused the same, have not onely affoorded thereunto thear good approbation, but have also earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated me (many of them) and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me all of them, to publish the same. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, I do humbly submit both my selfe and it to the charitable &amp; Christian censures of the reverend Fathers and Brethren of the Church of Christ, and to the gracious blessing of the Lord our heauenly father, who wil wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with me against all that shall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie minded, that my principall care and desire herein hath beene, and is, the advancement of his own glorie, in the edifying of his church: but especially of that people, and congregation, amongest whom I have (through his merciful providence) my standing and abiding. Make thy best vse of it, &amp; assist me with thy praiers:</p>
