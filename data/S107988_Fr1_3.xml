   <head>The preface to the
Reader:</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thankefulnes, for so
simple desert, may cause
the to requite him, wyth
any part of the like gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes,
who toke vpon
him this trauayle (suche
as it is) onely for thy commoditie, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reader: then staye a while, from the
reading of Tullie, and hearken fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
to this litle cōmunication, that
I craue at thy handes. I minde onely,
to excuse my selfe briefeli vnto the, and
so, to dismisse the. The matters, which
I thinke, colourablie may, and will be
obiected vnto me, are these. Firste, the
lacke of yeares, and eloquence, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the translation of so weyghtye a
booke: as, the very sages of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
haue let lye still, euen from the
time that it was first writtē, vnto this
daye. Then, the prophaning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of Philosophy, whiche are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
onelye of the learned, and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the multitude. And therfore, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete,
<pb facs="5"/>
to be made commen for euerye
man. First, as for mine owne vnable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for yeares, I aunswere, by Plato
and this mine authour: that I knowe
nothinge, but that, whiche my soule
nowe setled in my body, recounteth, as
thinges learned before. And the soule,
shal neuer haue the body more apte, to
whatsoeuer thinge it listeth to dispose
him, then in his youthe: whyche is, in
maner, the greenenesse of the same.</p>
   <p>Since therfore, the bodye, whych hath
no knoweledge, but by reason of the
soule, is in youth most apte and able to
execute the inuentions of the same:
what cause is there, whye the wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
one of the principall partes of the
soule, should not chiefelye in this nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
of the bodye, vtter her force and
vertue? Then, as for lacke of eloquēce.
First, this (I thinke) they wil al graūt.
That, it is not possible for any man, to
expresse the writinges of Tullie, in
Englishe, so eloquently: as he hath vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the same in latine. Then, for
mine owne translation: forasmuche as
it must of necessity, be either more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="5"/>
then, the stile of Tullie, or els
more foolishe, and ful of croked termes
(for Tullies meane none can attaine)
I had rather to be partener of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
due to simplicity, and plainenes:
then, with foolyshe and farre fet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
to make my translatiō seeme more
darke to the vnlearned, &amp; more foolishe
to the wise. By which my playnenes,
withoute counterfaite eloquence, if I
haue gotten no other commoditye: yet,
thus muche I am sure of, that I haue
thereby escaped, the iust reproofe, that
they deserue, whiche thinke, to cloke
their ignoraunce, wyth inkehorne ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
For, vnlesse it were in such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as the Lodgicians terme names
of arte, for the whych, we haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Englyshe words: I haue vsed none
but the playne and accustomed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Now: as touching the second ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
which containeth the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
disclosing of the miseries of lady
Philosophye (as mayster Grymoalde
termeth her) I thynke, that suffycient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
satysfyed, yf they consyder, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes
the raskall multitude, and the
<pb facs="6"/>
learned sages, there is a meane sort of
men: which although they be not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet, by the quicknes of their wits,
can conceiue al such poyntes of arte, as
nature coulde giue. To those, I saye,
there is nothing in this book to darke.
Especially, inasmuche as, the reading
of one booke, will open an other. And
thus, in my opinion, I am discharged
of vnprofitable reuealinge of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of philosophye. Inasmuche as,
both, I hope, it shall do muche good to
this sort of men, afore mencioned: and
also, I am sure, it can be nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the learned. But shal much more
enflame, all liberall wittes, wyth the
desire of knoweledge: when they shall
see, so worthye matters, contayned in
one litle boke, of that, which we terme
philosophy or learning. Besides these,
there are yet other faultes, as the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
of manye wordes, and the yll
printing of some greeke wordes, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
letters, &amp; of the verses also, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
then they shoulde be red. But the
blame thereof I vtterlye refuse. Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as, euerye man knoweth, that it
<pb facs="6"/>
doth nothinge pertayne vnto me. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles,
as for the firste, whych con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
the misprintinge of wordes,
thou shalt finde them, all corrected, in
the ende of the booke. So that if thou
list to reade it, without desire of faulte
findinge: thou mayst firste, amende all
those faultes, with thy pen, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geant
of thy booke, whiche in the ende
of the booke be corrected. And so haue
the sense perfecte. And as for the two
last, they were caused by necessitie.</p>
   <p>The one for lacke of a Greeke letter,
and thother, for want of a smaller let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to print the verses in a lesse roame
And for other faultes, that maye be
found in my verses, I truste they wyll
pardon me, who may meruaile, howe,
so sodaynely I am become a versifier.
But, I beseche thee, (gentle reader) to
place eche mannes faulte by him selfe:
that I may be forced to father no other
mans faultes, then mine owne.</p>
   <p>Which, as I knowe to be more, then
I would they were: so I shall desire the
to weygh them with gentlenes.</p>
   <p>Knowynge, that if such, as haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="7"/>
knoweledge, to set forthe thinges
more exactlye, should heare my plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
not ouermuche discommended:
they then, should be much more prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
wyth hope of the meruaylous
fame, that their doings should deserue
if they listed, to employe some paynes,
in attempting the like. Of the whych,
as I know there is a great number (in
both the vniuersities inespetially) so I
woulde wyshe, that eyther, they ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
any longer, to enuie knoweledge
to our Englyshe tounge, would staine
the same, with better: or els, that they
woulde not disdaine, to forde their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
wordes, to suche, as expresse
their good will in the same: althoughe
not so well as it might be, yet as theyr
eloquence will permit them. And thus
muche, to the learned reader, whom I
make the iudge of my worke, thoughe
I permit the reading of it, to all other.
But nowe, thou vnlearned reader: for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>asmuch
as, whatsoeuer I dyd, I dyd it
for the desyre, I had to profyte thee: it
shall be thy part, of the worst to thinke
<pb facs="7"/>
the best. For, had it not bene for thy
commoditye, I could wel enough haue
suppressed mine ignoraunce wyth sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
and so, by concealinge that lytle
whyche I knowe: although not blased
my simple skil: yet, wel haue auoyded,
the necessitie of excuse, in such thynges
as I deserue reprehension. But so
muche I tendered thy profyte, that, I
had rather to saie somewhat (although
not so perfectly, as some other mighte)
then, for lacke of my litle labour, to let
so wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hy as booke, lye vnknowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the. Thus, whiles I studye to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
thee, I am fayne to submitte my
doynges, to the iudgemente, of euerye
curious carper. Wherefore, inasmuch
as, I haue brought the (who towardes
these thinges, wast no otherwise then
blind) by my trauaile, to the sight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and caused the, to be rid frō blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
(which is so lothsome a thing, that
it is almoste growen into a prouerbe,
that a blinde man, would be glad to se
his nighest felowe hanged, because the
he shoulde see (then trulye, thoughe I
<pb facs="8"/>
craue no prayse at thy handes (because
it is a token of ignoraunce, to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the ignorant) yet, I may be bold,
to desire so much of the, as Apelles cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the foolishe shoomaker, to
performe. Who, when as he behelde
the picture of a man, drawen by Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
so liuelye, that the senses of man
would haue doubted, whether it were
a picture, or a liuing creature: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
wyth the syghte of it, whyche
was more meete for a prince to behold
then him: began, to finde faulte with
his showe. Apelles, knowynge that he
was a shomaker, toke it in good part:
&amp; wyth the pensile, amended the fault.
But the shoemaker by likelihood, sum
what proud, that he was able, to finde
faulte wyth Apelles workes: came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
the seconde daye. And, began to
disprayse the proportion of his face.</p>
   <p>Wherewithall, Apelles being muche
moued, stept forth, and sayde. No far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then thy shoe, sowter. Shewynge
thereby, that no man oughte to talke
farther, then his skill will beare him.</p>
   <p>Megabizes, esteemed Alexander as a
<pb facs="8"/>
prince, whiles he, stoode in his scoole,
and saide nothinge. But, when he
began to talke of thinges whyche he
knewe not: he said vnto him, that euen
his litle children, would laughe hym
to scorne. Wherfore, shortlye to make
an ende, and to sende the to Tullye.</p>
   <p>Do thou, neyther praise, nor disprayse,
farther then thy conning wil beare the
For, they are both alike faultes. But
rightly weyghe, and remember the
wordes of Tullie, to whom, I
now send the, to enioy such
pleasure, as at the fyrste,
whiles I my selfe red
him, I frendelye
wished vnto
thee.</p>
