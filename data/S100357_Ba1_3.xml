   <head>TO THE CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing the last sommer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one, solitarie in the Country, I was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed by the weekelie letters of one <hi>M. Iohn Withyman,</hi> a learned and godly yong man, who (if pouerty had not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to spend that time in attending vpon the presse, which hee should and most gladly would haue bestowed vpon his study) might haue proued (in mine opinion) if God had prolonged his daies and blessed his labors, a man in all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (especially diuine, whereunto hee was deuoted, being a minister and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the word) inferiour to few that I know in this age. This good yong man, being my kind neighbour, and hauing beene sometime my seruant and scholler
<pb facs="118"/>in the Citie; and after (by my meanes) placed in the vniuersitie, (where for the time his profiting was not ordinary) did in one or two of his letters request mee, that if I had any thing lying by me, that I thought might be of vse for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a benefit to him, I would send it to him, because now he had good leisure to perfect and publish it, faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that he would vse such liberty in adding and detracting, &amp; altring both the phrase and matter, as that it might bee trulie counted his owne. Vpon this condition I sent him this little <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> which here you see, not doubting, but that (according to his promise) hee would haue put a better coate and shape vpon it; but beeing preuented by the stroake of God, which at that time was to him so vnexpected (but for which he was at no time vnprepared) it returned (after some space of time) to mee againe as it went from mee, whereupon I ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into some doubtfull deliberation what to doe with it, inclining rather to
<pb facs="118"/>bury it in silence, then to suffer it to see the light, in this censorious and learned age, yet in fine (being incouraged by some friends) I gaue way to the publishing of it; trusting by the mercy of God, that it may be profitable to some, and hoping that it wil neither be offensiue nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to any; for which I pray, and desire thee therein to ioyne with me. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing plainly and truely shewed thee the occasion of this bolde aduenture. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vs all to the grace of God in Iesus Christ this <hi>18.</hi> of December. <hi>1612.</hi>
