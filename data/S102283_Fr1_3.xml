vnder the sunne (Right
Woorshipfull (which are
at greatest disagreement,
the motions of mans
mind, by the iudgement

to be at mutuall strife, by reason of that same

      <pb facs="3"/>
A proofe heereof appeareth in the confession
of that notable conuert of Tarsus in Cilicia, in
whome (his apostolicall vocation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
this opposition was so effectuall,
that he acknowleged a lawe in his members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
against the lawe of his mind, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him captiue vnto the lawe of sin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he vttered this patheticall exclamation,
O me miserum! Quis me à corpore mortis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius
vindicabit?</p>
   <p>For doubtles, there is no reasonable creature
consisting of soule and bodie, in whose mind
contrarie motions are not incamped, making
manie a hot skirmish, to amplifie and inlarge
the limits of their regiment; in so much that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes

whole conuersation, honest or dishonest: to the

&amp; seeing the same most liuelie describing
the hidden hart of man, and the variable state
of the same, I found that it is nothing else, but
a continuall temptation, and (as the patient
