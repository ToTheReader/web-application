   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, Maister <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> Doctor of the Ciuill Lawe, and one of the principall Secretaries, to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>TVllius,</hi> and <hi>Caius Plinius,</hi> wrote that neither <hi>Posie</hi> nor <hi>Rethoricke</hi> seemed sweete or delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without the ornament of eloquence Yet an Historie, of whatsoeuer sorte it be written, dooth please and delight: because, men may thereby knowe, the successe of things happened, to the knowledge whereof, the nature of man is bent: yea, the tale of a Plowman, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time delightfull to the hearer, especiallie when any new thing is discouered.</p>
   <p>And where the stile of this historie in our English tongue is not, nor at the least, I cā not polish as learned mē might require.
<pb facs="4"/>
Yet the troth and pith of the matter vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in plaine sort shall suffice giuing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as much (as in me lieth) to whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that will take the paines, to write it ouer againe, to beautifie the same, as to him or them shall seeme conuenient: as often times, hath happened among the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Historiographers and Translators.</p>
   <p>The Author of this woorke, right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, was a Gentleman of woorshipful stocke or linage, he was highlie esteemed of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift: vnto whose Maiestie, he was sometime <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</hi> in his roiall counsel of iustice, and afterward ordained <hi>Auditor</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the reuenues appertaining to his Maiestie in the Prouinces of <hi>Peru</hi> and firme lande.</p>
   <p>This well minded Gentleman, after the writing of this Historie, feared the
<pb facs="4"/>
publishing hereof for two principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: The one, least the discendent of such as had committed things not woorthie of praise, would conceaue some euill oppini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him: or els the issue of the vertuous and noble sort, would iudge the praise and commendations of their progenitors sufficiently set foorth according to their deserts: In consideration whereof, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to remembraunce the oppinion of <hi>Horatius,</hi> which was, that no Historie should come to light vntill nine yeares, were fullie past after the action thereof.</p>
   <p>This oppinion liked him not, but rather thought it more cōuenient, that Histories<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> woorthie of writing should abide in sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lēce for the space of lxxxx. yeeres, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in so manie yeares space, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and ofspring of the one sort might consume, and the race of the noble and vertuous, to be contented vvith the
<pb facs="5"/>
commendation of their Auncestors.</p>
   <p>The Kinge of <hi>Spaine</hi> that now is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perused the originall Copie of this Historie, requested mine Author to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the same in Printe: and in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his Maiesties commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt he hath so doone. And the Englishing of foure bookes of his worke, I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly here present vnto your Honor.</p>
   <p>I may at this day, God be praised, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie write that, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Portingall</hi> Naciōs dare glorie of their discoueries &amp; Nauigacions, with great commendations of their Captaines, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Vasco dela Gama, Magalanez, Hernando Cortez: Don Francisco Pisarro, &amp; Don Diego de Almagro.</hi> Now may our most gracious Queen, most iustly cōpare withall the Princes of the world, both for discouery &amp; nauigacion.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>The Discouery of the Portingall East India, was atchiued in <hi>26.</hi> moneths, &amp; the West India, in shorter space: <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanez</hi> returned not to manifest his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges: But our valyant and noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Captaine, <hi>Maister Francis Drake,</hi> in his Nauigation, was occupied more, or nighe three yeares: In which time, he sayled, and attained to the knowledge of the East, and West course, which none at any time had euer atchiued.</p>
   <p>His paineful trauaile, and maruailous Nauigation, was not obtayned with white handes, perfumed gloues, daintie fare, or softe lodging: no, no: <hi>Honour</hi> is not gotten with pleasures, &amp; quiet min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. For the sweet Roses groweth among Thornes: yet the ignorant will iudge, that perpetuall Fame and heauenly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, is a thinge to be gotten with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and ease. But if the poore Sayler
<pb facs="6"/>
should sit as Iudge, I am sure that hee would say, how extreame hunger, thyrst, hard lodging vpon Hatches, foule gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, blustryng stormes of winde, with Hayle, Snowe, bitter colde, Thunder, Lightning, and continuall perill of life, leadeth the hie pathway to <hi>the Court of eternall Fame.</hi> The honour of our good Captayne and company, lieth not in my Pen to set out accordingly: therfore, I remit the same to sutche as hereafter shall iustly sette foorth his paynes and trauell: My humble sute, is to beseech your Honour, to accept this woorke into your patronage, and the Almightie graunt your harts desire.</p>

      <signed>Your honours at commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thomas Nicholas.</hi>
