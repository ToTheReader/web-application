Yet the ignorance of Priests was not so blameable, as their sacrilege was damnable. For these wooden Priests tooke away from the peoples vse those <hi>golden Chalices,</hi> and robbed them of that, which is farre more precious, the heauenly liquor contained in them, which is sacramentally (as wee say, but as they beleeue substantially) the blood of our Sauiour, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualuable price of mans Redemption.

<pb facs="5"/>
vnsufferable enormity wee abound in passages of good Writers in all Ages. In other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, the Romanists, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, are tyed fast by the tailes: in this they are loose, and parted asunder, and they take direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courses. They disproue their own proofes and approoue our disproofes of them. <hi>Penelopes telam texunt, &amp; retexunt,</hi> they doe and vndoe. There is no argument of ours against them, which is not confirmed by some of them, no obiection of theirs against vs, which is not sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by some of their owne side; as thou mayst see through the whole, but especially in the last Chapter of this Discourse. Into which I Imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my studies the rather vpon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
   <p>About two yeeres since I was desired by a person of qualitie, to conferre with a L. a little before that time seduced by deceitfull guides, who first lead the party out of the right way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arminian tract, and afterward into the high rode of Popery lying not farre off. Vpon the first motion, I made some difficultie of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the party a meeting: because I suspected there might be shifted into the company, after their manner, some disguized Priest lying in <hi>subsidijs,</hi> or in Ambush as it were, that he might suddenly rush in vpon the least shew of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Yet after the messenger had assured mee, that there were none in the L<seg rend="sup">s</seg> companie, but such as sincerely affected the truth of the Gospell, I made then no scruple, but presently
<pb facs="6"/>
accompanied him to the Honorable personages house. Where I found, notwithstanding that the L. was prouided of a second, and that the L. mouth was vsed onely as a trunke to shoote out those poysoned bullets, which M. <hi>Euerard</hi> the Priest, and Confessor to this person, had chammed before with his teeth. <hi>Aspis à vipera sumit venenum:</hi> the Aspe, according to the Prouerb, borrowed poyson of the Viper. The Priest, in a few passages of speech vnawares dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered himselfe, <hi>tanquam sorex suo iudicio;</hi> whereupon I drew backe, and was very desirous to breake of further conference, because I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nothing lesse, then sincere dealing in a meeting, that was contriued by fraud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be acted in a masking manner. Yet when I obserued, that M. <hi>Euerard</hi> grew very insolent, and audacious vpon my withdrawing my selfe, and diuerse Knights and Gentlemen there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, religiously deuoted to the Truth, both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, and intreated me not to bee wanting to the necessarie defence thereof: <hi>(Cassium enim hunc sufflaminandum esse)</hi> at their instance, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke Master <hi>Euerard,</hi> and for many houres sometimes opposed, and sometimes answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in diuers points, but especially in the question most desired by both parties to bee particularly debated, touching the necessity of Communicating in both kinds. The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ended, I thought to haue heard no more of it, because it being on my part casuall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall; I conceiued it of little importance
<pb facs="6"/>
either way. But being since informed by an ho nourable Lord, that M. <hi>Euerard</hi> after that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter had not only with his tongue licked all his wounds whole, but also with a venemous tooth fastned many slanders vpon me, I thought fit to send him the ensewing relatiō of the Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, requiring him to adde, or alter, what he thought conuenient in his owne arguments, and answers, and then to consigne it with his subscription, as I meant to doe the rest with mine also. Vpon the receit hereof, he promised to returne me an answer with speed: but after many moneths failing thereof, being vrged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and again, and vpbrayded with his tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations, in the end he sent me a flat denial by <hi>S. P. L.</hi> and therein shewed himselfe to be of the nature of the Crocodile, or of those barbarous souldiers, of whom <hi>Muretus</hi> obserued, that they <note place="margin">Plin. nat. hist. l. 8. c. 25. Terribilis haec contra fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaces bellua, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gax contra inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. Orat.

Now, lest that this my Antagonist should take D. <hi>Weston,</hi> and M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> for two <hi>Enfant perdues,</hi> or <hi>forelorne hopes,</hi> for his <hi>presidents;</hi> who, when they ought <hi>mederi capiti,</hi> and answer to the maine, touching the visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Church, professing the Trent Faith 500. yeeres after Christ, <hi>reduuiam curarunt,</hi> and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing quit the matter of Faith, shaped some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable answer to impertinent circumstances of fact, and that of no great consequence either way: I haue therefore premised a Challenge
<pb facs="7"/>
to M. <hi>Euerard,</hi> as also to M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> to deale with me in this principall Controuersie; and I haue set downe the state thereof, and added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such proofes for the truth, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the prime Authors in all ages haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto me. All which I submit to thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent examination, and iudicious censure.</p>
