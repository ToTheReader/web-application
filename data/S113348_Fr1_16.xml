   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou will marvell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
(Reverend
<hi>Lord President</hi>)
what hath moved
me being a <hi>Divine</hi> by professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a <hi>Religious,</hi> to write
concerning <hi>Health,</hi> a subject
proper to <hi>Physicians.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter, I doubt not
to have given so just reasons in
<pb facs="13"/>
the <hi>preface</hi> of this work
(where I have set down the
aim of my undertakings in this
kinde) as will take away all
ground of wonderment. Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is not my purpose to
write like a Physician concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preservation of health;
that is, setting down a thousand
observations &amp; cautions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>qualitie</hi> of meats and
drinks, and of their proper <hi>use</hi>
according to the severall <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of the yeare, and of timely
<hi>purgation</hi> of humours, and of
<hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>watching, bodily
exercises,</hi> and <hi>medicines</hi>
whereby the severall humours
are to be corrected, and whereby
the <hi>Head, Stomack,</hi> and <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells</hi>
are to be comforted and
strengthened: I say, it was no
<pb facs="13"/>
part of my intent to enter upon
the handling of any of these
matters. For how ever it would
have been no great difficultie
perhaps to have gathered these
things out of sundrie <hi>Authours,</hi>
and afterwards to have with
judgement digested them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to order and method:
yet, that I might not seem to act
the part of a <hi>Physician</hi> rather
then of a <hi>Divine,</hi> I have
thought fit altogether to omit
the mention of them. There was
a higher matter in my designes,
and that which is proper to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:</hi>
that is, to recommend to
all (and in particular to the
<hi>Religious,</hi> and those who are
studiously addicted to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the mind) that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sobrietie,</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
<pb facs="14"/>
of so many singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
both to the mindes &amp; bodies
of men. For besides that it
brings <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>long life,</hi> it
doth wonderfully conduce to the
attainment of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> to
the exercises of <hi>Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> and
to the preservation of <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
and other vertues; and
withall causeth all these em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
and functions to be
performed with marvellous
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ase, and exceeding great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lation.
It befits not a <hi>Divine</hi>
to busie himself in trifles, which
appertain to the bodie, and to
engage delicate persons to the
further pursuit of such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
especially considering that
bodily health may very well be
preserved without them: but a
<pb facs="14"/>
      <hi>Divine</hi> ought principally to
have an eye to those good things
whereby we may become acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
to God, and promote our
own salvation. Inasmuch then
as <hi>Holy Sobrietie</hi> doth bring
with it the good things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to both parts of a man, I did
not think it mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eseeming my
profession, to write this short
Treatise in the commendation
thereof, and withall to shew and
declare, by what way and means
we might come to the just
<hi>scantling</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
   <p>I have annexed a Treatise
tending to the same purpose, of
<hi>a Venetian</hi> Gentleman <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick
Cornaro,</hi> a man of great
eminencie, and of a sharp judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
who having learned by
<pb facs="15"/>
experience of many yeares the
great vertue and power that is
in <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> did at last by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
notably make declaration
thereof.</p>
   <p>Both these Treatises (my
<hi>Reverend L.</hi>) I have thought
fit to dedicate unto your name.
and to send fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th into the world
under your patronage. For to
whom can a Treatise of <hi>Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
be more fitly dedicated, then
to such a one as hath so stoutly
and constantly followed <hi>Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,</hi>
as by the help thereof to
preserve himself vigorous and
cheerfull unto neare upon seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares of his age? You are he
that can sit a hūgry in the midst
of daily feasts, enjoyned to be
made unto the <hi>Gentrie</hi> that
passe by solitarie <hi>Campinia:</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/>
and whilest others fill their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and satisfie their appetites,
you contract both into narrow
bounds and limits. Besides this,
there are sundrie other causes,
which deserve this testimonie of
my venerable respect towards
your Lordship; to wit, that
zeal wherewith you do so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
promote the cause of
your <hi>Religion,</hi> which is so
exceedingly beneficiall to the
whole <hi>Church,</hi> and to our <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia:</hi>
and together herewith that
singular wisdome of yours in
<hi>Government,</hi> through means
whereof you have for so many
yeares space safely conserved
your noble <hi>Hospitall</hi> in that
desert where it stands, in the
midst of many tumults of wars,
and shocks of armies, in great
<pb facs="16"/>
licencio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>snesse of militarie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
and almost daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes
of both sides unto it: by
means whereof you have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not onely recovered it out
of those great debts, wherewith
it was formerly burthened, but
have moreover adorned it with
beautifull structures, and a
high Tower for the settling of a
<hi>Monasterie</hi> therein. And that
I may passe over your other
vertues, whereof <hi>Sobrietie,
the mother of all vertues,</hi>
is the true cause in you, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
seems due to you in
particular, in regard of that
ancient friendship which for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fourtie yeares space I have
had with your brother, <hi>Father
George Colibrant,</hi> a learned
man, and of noted holinesse,
<pb facs="16"/>
exceedingly addicted to sobrietie,
prayer, mortification of the
flesh, and zeal touching the soul:
by whose example &amp; wholesome
admonitions, many Centuries
of excellent young men have in
sundrie places given themselves
unto <hi>holy Religion.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
that we likewise have
with your other brother, <hi>John
Colibrant,</hi> a man of great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse,
whose every where
approved integritie farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
rich patrimonies, makes
this work belong to you. I
could relate many other things
appertaining to your own and
your friends commendation: but
I make spare of them, that I
may not offend your modestie,
which doth not willingly heare
such matters.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="17"/>Receive therefore (<hi>Right
Reverend Lord</hi>) this small
gift, a testimonie of our affec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards you and yours: and
be not wanting to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of that excellencie of
holy <hi>Sobrietie</hi> which you have
made proof of in your self, and
we make declaration of in this
Treatise, to all men, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to <hi>Gods servants,</hi> that
they may by this means come to
serve God more perfectly and
sweetly in this life, and obtain
greater glory in heaven.</p>
   <p>Now I beseech the <hi>Divine
Goodnesse</hi> to prosper all your
holy designes to its own glorie,
&amp; the salvation of men; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that you shall have been
adorned with all manner of
<pb facs="17"/>
vertue, to renew your long and
happie <hi>Old age</hi> with the blessed
<hi>youth</hi> of <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
