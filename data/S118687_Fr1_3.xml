   <head>TO THE RIGHT vertuous, wise, and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Lady, the Lady</hi> Mary Winfeild, <hi>Grace</hi> and Peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree things there are (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady) which as in all times, haue hindered the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, so in these our daies, do not a little keepe men from sincere pietie: worldlines plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb facs="3"/>and persecution. Touch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the two first, in the <hi>14.</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>18.</hi> verse, they which were bidden to the Lordes supper, excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues after this manner: One said, I haue bought a farme, and another said, I haue married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. The world is like vnto a Sea, in which many men are drowned. The fish Polypus, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise a sottish creature, yet in the catching of shel-fish, vseth strange diligence: euen so some haue wisedome, onely for gain; but as concerning religion, they are merely brutish. As for
<pb facs="3"/>pleasure, if it be a principle that <hi>plures gula quam gladio periere:</hi> moe haue perished by gluttony then by the sword: How many haue perished tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row voluptuousnes? Riches and pleasures are many a mans God. Now concerning persecution, how many are so effeminate that they cannot abide any tryall? Fiery tryal through the mercies of God, wee haue none by the meanes of a gratious King, whom the Lord blesse continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; yet are the godly afflicted with vices and sinnes: blessed are they that can mourne for
<pb facs="4"/>the sinnes of other men: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the godly persecuted with the sinnes of men only, but also with their tongues. He that feareth God now a daies, is made a wonder amongst men. This is a grieuous persecution, because it is done by men, that professe the same religion; and sogrieuous is it to many, that for this cause they will not bee counted religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: they had rather bee open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophane, then publiquely religious, lest they should be scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at. Shall wee thinke that these men would abide the fiery tryall, that cannot abide this so easie a kind of tryall? Now that
<pb facs="4"/>men may relinquish the world and worldly pleasures, and also that they bee not offended with persecution, I haue penned this treatise: the Lorde blesse the same, to all that shall read it. A true Christian may say with the Poet:
<q>
         <l>Quocūque aspicio nihil est nisi p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

         <l>Fluctibus hic tumidus, nubibus ille minax.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Whethersoeuer I cast my eies, there is nothing but the sea, and the aire, the one raging with his waues, the other threatning with clouds. To conclude, as I thoght good to publish this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, so I iudged it meete to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same to your worshippe,
<pb facs="5"/>being a true paterne of piety, and a rare example of religion. The Lord for his mercies sake, multiply these his graces vpon you, that you may liue Eternally.</p>
