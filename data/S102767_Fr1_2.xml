   <head>TO MY WORTHY FRIEND M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. A. M.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>rR, your letter contained a request, which I must needs say, was to my tast, bitter-sweet. It could not but be pleasing, as proceeding frō your selfe; and yet the quality of it, to my disposition, could not but seeme bitter. Your dem und was, that I should giue a briefe Censure in generall, and make some obseruations, vpon such particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, as might seeme to need explication, in <hi>M. Doctour Kellison</hi> his Treatise, of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Hierarchy. You know the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall antipathy of my complexion, with such businesses, as may haue any face of Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy; besids the want of many helpes, requisite for such an employment. Neuerthelesse, I haue submitted my iudgement, and will, to your Commaund, &amp; do heere present you with such
<pb facs="3"/>notes, as I haue gathered: professing not to haue set downe, all that occurred to my mind: and to say the truth, I was willing to beleeue the best, &amp; for my owne ease, to omit the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of some passages, which yet I might sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect would haue giuen iust aduantage. I doubt not but some more diligent, and exact pen will supply my defects. The method I hold, is to reduce all to certaine heades, or <hi>Questions,</hi> out of which may easily be drawne answere, to the particulars; for it had bene a tedious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, to answere <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> line for line. Yet to the end the Reader may know, where to finde the answere of euery particular, my <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Question</hi> is imployed, in a suruey of <hi>M. Doctours</hi> booke, chapter by chapter, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what <hi>Question</hi> of mine, euery <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of his, is answered. If this my labour doe not satisfy your expectation, yet I doubt not but my endeauour wilbe the more grateful, in that for your sake, I haue done my best. And so, you will remaine the more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that without any exception I am wholy</p>
