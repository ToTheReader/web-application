      </gap> whither all prayers, other then set prayers, and those either the Lords prayer, or the Churches publicke <hi>formes</hi>▪ of this Authors <hi>priuate formes,</hi> bee denyed to Gods people, or Ministers, as vttered from <hi>priuate spirits and Ghosts of their owne</hi> (they are the words of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>) wherein perhaps the Author takes the liberty to bewray his malice, or ignorance, or want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the supply of the <hi>spirit of Christ,</hi> helping our <hi>infirmities</hi> in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. as not hauing his <hi>wits exercised</hi> that way: we haue occasion giuen in the first place to touch vpon the second <hi>reason</hi> of these his <hi>houres:</hi> the words are, <hi>To let the world vnderstand, that they who giue it out and accuse vs here in England to haue set vp a new Church, and a new faith, to haue abandoned all the ancient formes of piety and deuotion, to haue taken away all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious prayers and exercises of our forefathers, to haue despised all the old Ceremonies, and cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vs the blessed Sacraments of Christs Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. Is not here a sound reason, for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of old Popish <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and superstitions, and such trumperies into our Church, to the end that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish mouthes may be stopt, who slander our Church in this behalfe, for antiquating all <hi>old Ceremonies,</hi> whereof the obseruation of the seuen <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> is one? Then, belike we must set vp Popery againe, at least in a good part, onely to appease the clamours of Papists, accusing vs for Nouelists. But take heed what you doe; for vnlesse you meane thus by degrees to reare vp the whole tower of Babylon again in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,


<pb facs="20"/>
you striue in vaine to stoppe their mouthes, who will haue all or none. But in the meane time remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what your <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> (if ye be indeed her true bred sonnes) saith, <hi>Of such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as be vsed in the Church, and haue had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by the institution of man. Some at the first were of godly intent and purpose deuised, and yet at length tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vanity and superstition: some entred into the Churh by vndiscreet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>cted,</hi> &amp;c. Heere consider, whether your seuen <hi>Canonicalls</hi> be not of the number of those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which haue had their beginning by the institution of man▪ by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. as we haue shewed, and perhaps for a good intent and purpose, yet at length haue turned to vanity and superstition, as is manifest both by the doctrine and practise of the Church of Rome; or such, as hauing entred into the Church by vndiscreet deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and zeale without knowledge, and for because winked at in the beginning▪ and growing dayly to more and more abuses, our Church not onely for their vnprofitablenesse, but because of their much blinding of the people, and obscuring Gods glory, hath thought worthy to cut away and cleane reiect. Consider it, I say. For hath, not our Church among many other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious ceremonies, quite casheered this of your Canonicall houres? But thereupon she hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>A nouellist, a setter vp of a new Church, and a new faith, to haue abandoned all the ancient formes of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and deuotion, to haue taken away all the religious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and prayers of our forefathers, to haue despised all the old Ceremonies</hi> &amp;c. But of whom doth our Church


<pb facs="21"/>
heare this? Of the Church of Rome. And can she blame Rome for it? But charity would, or Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or I wot not what tender care of her owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, being thus exposed to the obloquy of her enemy, she should salue the wound againe, which the venemous tongue hath made, How? The Authors of this booke, her pregnant young sonnes, though no small babies (I wis) can tell their old Mother, shee must now after threescore yeares and more (seing there is no other remedy) in her old age turne ouer a new leafe, begin to renew her old acquaintance with her stepmother, or elder sister at least, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> intertaine some of her old ceremonies againe as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which long agoe she abandoned as superstitious; receiue, reuiue that faith, and religion as the Old, which earst she reiected as the New; thus after shee hath begun, yea so many yeares continued and growne vp to a ripenesse <hi>in the spirit,</hi> she must with the foolish Church of Galatia <hi>be made perfect in the flesh.</hi> But <hi>we hope better things</hi> of our reuerend Mother,<note place="margin">

   <p>As for that other clause▪ of hauing it cast in our dish, that we <hi>cast behinde vs the blessed Sacraments of Christs Catholicke Church</hi>; which cannot be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to our Church, but onely because we allow no more <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but two (a point not a little materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if well weighed) of this we shall haue occasion to speake more, when we come to▪ his <hi>Sacraments of the Church.</hi> Onely by the way this is a faire inducement to draw on his 7. Sacraments; for otherwise how shall he thereby acquit vs (forsooth) of the grieuous scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and imputation, which the Church of Rome layes to our charge, of our reiecting the <hi>blessed Sacraments of


<pb facs="21"/>
Christs Catholicke Church</hi>? As if he should say (as in effect, and almost <hi>totidem verbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> he doth say) <hi>They charge vs falsely, in saying that we cast behind vs the blessed Sacraments of Christs Catholicke Church;</hi>
      <note place="margin">The Authors owne words in is Preface.</note>
      <hi>alas, silly simples: these men do little else, but bewray their owne infirmities, and haue more violence or will, then reason or judgement, for what they say: the common accusations, which out of the abundance of those partiall affectious that transport them the wrong way, they are pleased to bring so frequently against vs, being but the bare reports of such people, as either doe not, or will not vnderstand vs, what we are. Doe we cast behind vs the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christs Catholicke Church; Who told you so, I pray you at Rome? No; I would yée well wist it, we hold seuen Sacraments, the same Sacraments that the Church of Rome, Christs Catholick Church holdeth; as shall appeare by good proofe anon.</hi> But leaue we his proofe to the fit and proper place, and prosecute we the rest.</p>
   <p>His third reason for his 7. Canonicals, is, <hi>for the ease of those, whom earnest lets and impediments doe often hinder from being partakers of the publick; here they may haue a dayly and deuout order of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate prayer</hi> &amp;c. First what an incongruitie is this, to prescribe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se his <hi>houres</hi> to men earnestly imployed in worldly affaires? Indeed the obseruation of these houres is proper (if for any) for such as liue a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall life, <hi>Abbey Lubbers,</hi> as we say, such as haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to attend, but to be busied with their beads. And againe, for all sorts of persons in our Church, blessed be God, we haue plenty of <hi>Psalters,</hi> and <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> wherein they may as profitably (I trow) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their vacant houres, as in these consarcinated and new moulded prayers. And in the third place, doth not this new <hi>Rubrick</hi> of our Author trench &amp; intrude


<pb facs="22"/>
vpon those formes of prayer both publicke and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate▪ which by our Church are generally prescribed for all persons in the daily practise of their Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And are not <note n="*" place="margin">In the end of the Preface before the booke of Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer.</note> Ministers in particuler admonished to read the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Euening Prayer</hi> priuately eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day▪ in case (at least) if hee bee not hindered by his studies, and other imployments of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
   <p>Againe, in the same Clause, he glancingly giues a sound by-blow to those, that stand vp in maintaining the quarrell of Gods truth against Popish perturbers, and Pelagian innouators; the <hi>continuall and curious disquisition of many vnnecessary questions among vs, being nothing else, but onely the new seedes, or the old fruits of malite, and by consequence the enemy of godlinesse, and the abatement of true deuotion.</hi> This man would willingly fold his hands, and wrap vp all his <hi>Deuotion</hi> in the mantle of ignorance, the <hi>Mother</hi> of his <hi>Deuotion.</hi> Like to the glowo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me, or rotten post, that shines not but in the night, so shines his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without light, or heat. Or at the best, like a wandring <hi>ignis fatuus.</hi> And how should the lampe of true Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on flame forth and burne in holy feruency of effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prayer, if it be not fedde with the oyle of sauing knowledge, being pressed forth more copiously by the ventilation of errours, and dissipation of mysts▪ which would dampe and extinguish all. Nor is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herewith but this blind <hi>Deuotion</hi> of his he dare call <hi>that true deuotion wherwith God is more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a good soule more inflamed, then with all the subtilties in the world:</hi> when at one dash he interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>God,</hi> as an approuer of his superstitious, and blind <hi>Deuotion,</hi> and a disallower of his owne fundamentall diuine Truthes, as <hi>busy</hi> needlesse <hi>subtilties,</hi> yea <hi>as new seedes or old fruits of malice,</hi> and as <hi>the enemy of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and abatement of true Deuotion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="22"/>His last reason is, that this his booke of Canonicall houres, might stirre vp all those, <hi>who are coldly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the like heauenly dutie of performing their daily Christian deuotions,</hi> &amp;c. Thus this man hopes to conuert all England at a cast, and bring them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circle of his Canonicall houres, wherein they may trauerse and turne round their Beads, as a blind mill-horse in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ound. <hi>Impius ambula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitu.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for his exact and compleate <hi>Calender of Saints,</hi> we omitt it, as too tedious, and fitter for the Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack-maker to examine. Onely we cannot but touch vpon his times, <hi>wherein Mariages are not solemnized:</hi> as, <hi>from Aduent sunday vntill</hi> 8. <hi>dayes after the Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: from Septuag. sunday vntill</hi> 8. <hi>dayes after Easter. From Rogation Sunday vntill Trinity Sunday.</hi> All which times summed vp together, according to the computation of his owne <hi>Calendar,</hi> take vp aboue 19. weekes from the yeare. Now (vnder <hi>Benedicite</hi> be it spoken) where doth Gods sacred word suspend or prohibite any times from sacred &amp; solemne nuptiall rites? I remember it warnes vs of the <hi>perillous times of the last dayes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> wherein <hi>men</hi> should <hi>giue heed</hi> to <hi>sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing spirits and doctrines of Deuils.</hi> And what be those? The Apostle there tels vs, <hi>Forbidding of marriage, and abstaining from Meates.</hi> Now God blesse the Church of England from such <hi>seducing spirits, and Doctrines of Deuils.</hi> And is not the prohibiting of marriage for some certaine times in the yeare (and those no small times neither, as incroching vpon aboue a third part of the yeare) as well as forbidding of marriage to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons, as Priests, a branch (at least) of that very <hi>forbidding of marriage,</hi> which the Apostle calleth <hi>a doctrine of Deuils?</hi> And might not the same Church, which prohibited aboue the third part of the yeare, haue also, with the allegation of a few more


<pb facs="23"/>
plausible pretences of <hi>holinesse,</hi> or so, brought all <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi> to secke and sue for <hi>lic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nces</hi> in the <hi>Court?</hi> Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> blessed be God, that these prohibited times are not any where set downe either in our <hi>booke of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or any other bookes containing the Doctrines of the Church of England, wherevnto Ministers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe; least all should either haue cause absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary not to subscribe, or, subscribing to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, they should proue a very packe of <hi>spirits of Fr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> teaching, or at least <hi>subscribing</hi> to <hi>Doctrines of Deuils.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But let vs heare the Authors reasons, why in such times <hi>marriages are not vsually solemnized? Some of these</hi> (saith hee) <hi>being times of solemne-fasting and abstinence, some, of holy festiuity and ioy. Both fit to be spent in such sacred exercises, without other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie auocations.</hi> So he. Alas! Neither times of <hi>fasting,</hi> nor times of <hi>feasting,</hi> for marriage. Indeed for time of fasting and prayer something may be said; Yet with qualification.</p>
   <p>The Apostle saith (speaking to the man and wife) <hi>Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.5.</note>
      <hi>that yee may giue your selues to Fasting and Prayer, and come together againe, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</hi> A respect then might be had to fasting and prayer, euen to them that are married. But how? Doth the Apostle inioyne them by some <hi>Apostolicke Constitution</hi> or <hi>Canon,</hi> to abstaine for such, or so long a time, vnlesse they will purchase their liberty with a <hi>Licence?</hi> No such thing. He leaues that to their owne liberty, and referrs it to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent, not limiting themselues to any set time, least in the meane time <hi>Satan tempt them for their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency.</hi> Much lesse doth he confine them to mutuall separation ten leauelong weekes together. A shrewd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> for <hi>Satan</hi> haply to worke vpon. Yea and this


<pb facs="23"/>
ten weekes limitation from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> (by the Authors allegation) falls vnhappily (if wee goe according to the course of Natures rules) vpon the most dangerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of the ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re, the Springtime, wherein the blood and spirits are most stirring. But our Authour takes order for that, hee will haue them well macerated and mortified, tempered and tamed with <hi>Nine wéek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. The which had need to be full strictly imposed vpon young people not married, to discipline and keepe them in order, especially such as haue not the gift of continencie, and cannot without danger stay till those ten weeke be expired. And we know, that our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Booke</hi> alledging the authoritie of the Apostle, saith expresly, <hi>That such persons, as haue not the gift of continencie might marrie, and keepe themselues vndefiled members of Christs Body</hi>; where also no time is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or excluded.</p>
   <p>But whatsoeuer our Authour may pretend for the time of solemne fasting and prayer, as not seasonable for marriage: Yet to restraine men from marriage in times of <hi>Festiuitie and ioy,</hi> may seeme to be verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable. For what times fitter for <hi>Solemnizing</hi> the Rites of <hi>Marriage,</hi> then times of <hi>Festiuitie and ioy?</hi> Yea, but the Authour doth not exempt all, fast of festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall times, but onely such as are <hi>Solemne</hi> and <hi>Sacred,</hi> holy times. That's somewhat to the purpose. <hi>Holy times.</hi> Alas poore Marriage, art thou now become so vncleane, vnholy, as to be shut out from holy times? Thou wast wont to be <hi>Honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled</hi>; If wee may belieue the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And our Church calls it; <hi>The holy estate of Matrimonie.</hi> Yea, and if we may belieue our Authour, and if hee haue not forgotten himselfe, he placeth <hi>Matrimonie</hi> among his <hi>Seuen Sacraments.</hi> And if it be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is it not holy? And if <hi>Holy,</hi> is the celebration of it vnsutable for <hi>Holy times?</hi> But <hi>Marriage</hi> (it seemeth) is an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation,</hi> as our Authour termes it.


<pb facs="24"/>
An <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> And is it not a necessarie vocation? How then an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> But why should <hi>Marriage</hi> (if rightly vsed, <hi>according to Gods Ordinance</hi>) be either a necessarie or <hi>vnnecessarie auocation?</hi> Was the <hi>Marriage</hi> in <hi>Cana,</hi> whereat it pleased CHRIST himselfe to be present, any <hi>impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>auocation</hi> to him from working a gracious <hi>Miracle,</hi> whereby all the guests had abundant cause and occasion to prayse GOD, and his Disciples especially to belieue more firmly in their MESSIAS? And I pray you, when was this <hi>Marriage in Cana?</hi> When? Not (I hope) within any of the holy times exempted from Marriage. And least of all within <hi>Fourtie dayes</hi> of the <hi>Passeouer,</hi> the <hi>Holy time of Lent.</hi> Yet if wee may belieue all those that haue written and calculated the verie time of that <hi>Marriage,</hi> they say all with one vnanimous voyce, for the most part, that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little of the <hi>Passeouer,</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> yea within lesse then 40. or yet twentie <hi>dayes.</hi> But we hope then, that the married couple had procured a <hi>Licence</hi> out of the <hi>High Priests Court.</hi> Alas, they were a poore couple, not able to prouide Wine, as the vsuall manner of the Countrey required, but water onely; and scant of that too: For there were sixe water-pots of Stone, but wanting filling vp: But no Wine at all. And <hi>ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> or more, for a <hi>Licence,</hi> would haue said well to the filling of those <hi>Pots</hi> with <hi>Wine,</hi> as <hi>Wine</hi> went in that plentifull Countrey. But neither doe we read, that on any such time, or times, <hi>Holy,</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> or call them what you will, were marriages euer prohibited to bee celebrated, no not in that present corrupt state of the Church of the Iewes, where notwithstanding the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie High Priests office was ordinarily bought and sold; enough to haue put them to their wits to improue all meanes to scrape vp their disbursments again by hooke and by crooke, by pilling and polling as well the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the inferiour Priests. But this particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement

was not hatched in those dayes, as bad as they were. <hi>Antichrist</hi> was not yet knowne, not yet <hi>ascended</hi> out of the <hi>Bottomlesse-pit,</hi> to bring into the world such a <hi>Doctrine of Diuels.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be obiected, How then is this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise crept into the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> It is an easier matter to find which way it crept in, then (it seemeth) how it may be swept out. It lurked among some rubbidge of Romish Reliques, and so escaped shipping away with other of <hi>Romes</hi> trinkets. Yea, it may well (in my iudgement) be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That it is not professed or auowed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> but in certaine Courts onely. And it were to be wished, that the Authour with all his Deuotion could perswade those Courts, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the times prohibited for Marriage are holy and sacred, fit for <hi>fasting</hi> or <hi>festiuall ioy,</hi> they would by these reasons disswade their Suters from taking Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Marriages also being an <hi>vnnecessarie auocation,</hi> and the like. Thus by putting a difference betweene the times sacred, and common, the Courts may either disswade from Licences for the time, or pully vp such Licences to a higher rate, so putting a pecuniarie mulct vpon such Delinquents. But a light gaine makes a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie purse. And <hi>Licenciâ sumus omnes deteriores.</hi> And <hi>Auri sacra fames</hi> can easily dispence with the most <hi>Sacred times,</hi> whether of <hi>Fasting,</hi> or solemne <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ob.</hi> But though the Ministers of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> find it not as a <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> to subscribe to, yet they conforme to the practise of it. They doe not marrie in any prohibited times without a <hi>Licence.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a thing but taken vp of a fashion, as I imagine, and so, practised, as a <hi>Tradition,</hi> not well thought of. They (I am sure, I) know no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or authoritie for this in the expresse <hi>Rubricks,</hi> or Rules of our ministeriall Order, then either by <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;

or from the anniuersarie <hi>Almanacke,</hi> and now at last from our Authours <hi>Canonicall</hi> Booke of <hi>Deuotion.</hi> And certainly there is no other law for it, that I know, but the Popes <hi>Canon Law.</hi> I dare say it is not in all the <hi>Common Law of England,</hi> nor yet in the <hi>Statute Lawes</hi> of the Land. And whether the Popes <hi>Canon Law</hi> bee cancelled in <hi>England</hi> to be frustrate <hi>de iure,</hi> at least, though not, <hi>de facto,</hi> I cannot say. But enough, if not too much, of this matter.</p>
   <p>But come wee to the body of the Booke, wherein we purpose not to insist, but to touch vpon some points and passages lightly, according to the moment of each.</p>
   <p>Vpon the Second Commandement hee glosseth no otherwise, in some particulars, then a Iesuite may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe for the defence of <hi>Romes</hi> Doctrine of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images. <hi>Offenders of the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (saith he) <hi>are they, that make any other Images</hi> (to wit of the Creatures) <hi>or the likenesse of any thing whatsoeuer (be it of Christ and his Crosse, or be it of his blessed Angels) with an intent to fall downe and worship them.</hi> Now a <hi>Iesuite</hi> with a distinction can easily make this good for his Doctrine, to wit, not to worship those <hi>Images</hi> with the <hi>worship of Latria,</hi> nor otherwise simply, but with relation to the <hi>Prototype.</hi> So that, for ought we know, the Authour implyeth, that some kind of adoration may be either giuen to the <hi>Image</hi> respectiuely to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> or at least before the <hi>Image,</hi> to the <hi>Prototype.</hi> Againe he saith, <hi>They that are worshippers of Idols, or representments of false Gods.</hi> This clause is wholly Iesuiticall. See the <hi>Doway translation</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. where the <hi>Iesuites</hi> allow none other <hi>Images</hi> to bee forbidden in the second <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> but onely <hi>Idols,</hi> and those forsooth are (say they) the <hi>Images of false Gods.</hi> Iust so our Author here. As if <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> being worshipped in and by their representations, were not turned into <hi>false Gods?</hi>
      <pb facs="25"/>
Or as if <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Idolum &amp; Simúlachrum,</hi> an <hi>Idol</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> were not all one. See <hi>Polyd. Virgil. de Inuent. rerum. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.</p>
   <p>Againe, <hi>They that are worshippers of Saints Images, and out of a false opinion of promeriting the protection of the blessed Uirgin, or any other Saint of God, doe giue a religious adoration to those vsuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentments, which be made of them.</hi> Now in all this, he speakes nothing against Poperie, and so all his flourish is but a meere froth, while he would seeme to say something against it. For howsoeuer Popish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is, yet they teach not that <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> in them, is <hi>meritorious.</hi> So that the Authour leaues it as granted, that a man may vse <hi>Images</hi> in their <hi>Saint-inuocation,</hi> so he account it not <hi>meritorious.</hi> Thus he is rather for Poperie in this point▪ then against it.</p>
   <p>Vpon the fourth <hi>Commandement,</hi> he saith, <hi>They offend vnder a pretence of seruing God more st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

         </gap>tly, then others (especially for hearing, and meditating of Sermons) doe by their Fasts, and certaine Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing obseruations condemne the ioyfull festiuitie of this high Holy-day, which the Church allowes as well for the necessarie recreation of the body in due time, as for Spirituall exercises of the Soule.</hi> Here we come more plainly to discerne the <hi>Wolfe</hi> in the <hi>Sheeps skinne,</hi> or in the Sheepherds cloke. For here he breakes down a gap, and whistles out the Sheepe, that straying, hee may deuoure them. Yea in this speech, he goes about to set open the verie Flood-gate of all profuse propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. First, All truly religious and conscionable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of GOD he makes to be but a <hi>pretence,</hi> Hypocrisie and dissimulation. But the maine marke his enuie and malice shootes at, is, especially, <hi>Hearing and meditating of Sermons.</hi> By this verie speech, a man that neuer saw nor knew the Authour, may easily conclude, whether he be a <hi>Resident</hi> vpon his <hi>Cure,</hi> or no, a faithfull Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, or no. <hi>Hearing and meditating of Sermons</hi> hee

But what be those <hi>ioyfull Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuities</hi> of this <hi>High and Holy-day</hi>? He mentioneth not.

of our Church, and the egregious sophistry of this our Author. <hi>Those fiue,</hi> saith the one, as pointing to those which now the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the beginning of the blessed <hi>Queenes</hi> Raigne (newly then purged from Popery, as in 1562, when those Articles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled) had cut off from the number of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although <hi>those fiue</hi> were euen then in high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme still with too many, not yet powred from their Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the <hi>Sacraments of the Church,</hi> he will needs haue them to be <hi>Sacraments.</hi> But <hi>Sacraments</hi> must haue <hi>a visible signe ordained of God,</hi> or else they are no Sacraments. And these haue <hi>no visible signe ordained of


<pb facs="30"/>
God,</hi> saith our <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore our Author crosseth the doctrine of our Church expresly. Onely he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that these, <hi>the other fiue haue not</hi> (in generall) <hi>the like nature, that the two principall and true Sacraments haue.</hi> If in this his speech their lurke no equiuocation (for he may closely meane by <hi>The like nature,</hi> that these are not <hi>generally necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as the first <hi>two</hi>) hee must needs inferre that these his <hi>other fiue are no true Sacraments</hi>; therefore false and bastard <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And if we take the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> in the largest sense, as those fiue are, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that reckoning, the number of <hi>Sacraments</hi> will quickly amount from <hi>other fiue,</hi> to fiue hundreth. For as Saint <hi>Chrisostome</hi> obserueth, in his 11. <hi>Hom.</hi> on <hi>Luke, Omnia quaecun{que} fecit Christus. Sacramenta sunt, siue ambulauit, &amp;c. All things, whatsoeuer Christ did, are Sacraments, whither hee walked, or eate, or dranke, or fasted, or wept, &amp;c.</hi> All these saith <hi>Chrysostome, Sacramenta nostra sunt,</hi> they are our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
   <p>To conclude this point of difference, there is some oddes betweene their naming of these Sacraments: Our Church calls them, <hi>Confirmation, Penance, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Matrimony, and Extreame vnction:</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is pleased to call his fiue, thus, <hi>Confirmation, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, Orders, Matrimony, and visitation of the sicke, or Extreme vnction.</hi> In two of his fiue hee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; hee calls <hi>Penance, Penitence,</hi> and <hi>Extreme vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he calls, <hi>Visitation of the sicke.</hi> In which two new names of his new Sacraments there lurkes not a little of Serpentine poyson. For first, he would bring <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> to be all one with popish <hi>Penance.</hi> For doth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ation</hi> turne the word for <hi>Repentance, Penance.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="31"/>Now <hi>Penance</hi> is a Popish word, and implyeth the Popish practise in this their <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is to inioyne <hi>Shrift,</hi> or <hi>Confession,</hi> to wit, a strict and exact enumeration of all a mans sins in the eare of the Priest, like the streame of a puddle or kennell, emptying it selfe into a common sinke or Sewer. Hereupon he receiues his <hi>Absolution,</hi> which is a broome to sweepe the kennell, to make it fit for more puddle water, though sweet (I wis) to the Priests palate. For <hi>Dulcis odor luchri ex re qualibet,</hi> as the Emperour said of his Doung: <hi>Gaine smels sweet though is come from a Dunghill.</hi> The second of his misnamed Sacraments is, for <hi>extreame vnction, visitation of the sicke</hi>; all is one with him; <hi>Visitation of the sicke, or Extreame vnction,</hi> which yee will. So that if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doe at any time goe to <hi>visit the Sicke</hi> (as I feare he doth seldome, at leastwise hio sicke flocke) it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply someone desire his Ghostly father-hood, in cafe when the Priest or Iesuite is not in the way: I hope he carries his annointing or annealling bottle at his girdle, like a carefull Shepheard with his tarre Bot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

it out of the Church. This prayer is against all worldly respects in Ministers, against the shamelesse ambition of this age. It prayes against Antichrist, contrary to those, that would raise vp againe the throne of that Beast in this our Church. It prayes against all hirelings, such as in these dayes for preferments will sell soule and body to the Diuell, turne time-seruers, and mens seruants. It prayes against men possest with a reprobate sense, who are Authors of sects, and schismes, heresies and errors, whereof this present age is full. Although the ring-leaders of sects and schismes, who make a pitifull and rufull Rent in the Church of England, by Siding with Popery &amp; Arminianisme, yet forsooth cry out vpon the true Ministers and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Gospell, as the onely sectaries and schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes. And if this were true then, no lesse now, when Ignorance, if not hath, yet at least striues to get the vpper hand, seeking to cast the blacke mantle of blind Deuotion ouer all mens eyes, and that by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Ministers seeking by all meanes to quench the light of the Gospell?

And such are the most strict obseruers of Lent: If there be any sinne, or pleasure, whereof out of blind superstition they impose and inforce a restraint vpon themselues, for Lent-sake while they demurely goe in blacke: It giues them but occasion to affect and pursue the same sinne or pleasure with greater desire all the yeere after. The affections, for the time, being but as waters stopt with the Sluce, which the longer pent vp, breake out againe with greater violence. Although in the meane time all the Lent long, they abate nothing of their Pride, of their Couetousnesse, of their Ambition, and other habituall Lusts. He that will eat no Flesh in Lent, will not intermit his ordinarie Swearing, and vaine wicked Oathes, though he remit some-what of his Eating, yet will not abate an ynch of his Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good-fellowship, will take no lesse Vse-mony, then at <hi>Christmas,</hi> will not abate an ace of his poore Tenants Rackt-rent, will stretch the strings of his <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pouch as much now for a lustie prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb facs="36"/>
as he will doe any time out of Lent. Though IOHN the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> were for his much fasting called <hi>Iohannes Ieiunator,</hi> IOHN the <hi>Faster,</hi> yet he wanted for no pride and ambition to aspire to be vniuersall Head of the Church, that which GREGORY of <hi>Rome</hi> cryed out against, as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> but BONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FACE the Third a little after got that Title wholly to himselfe, suffering none to be that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but the Pope, and Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And it is vsuall, that as fasting breeds wind in the stomacke: So the opinion of fasting, specially when it is a part of Will-worship, and humane inuention, fills the stomacke of the Soule full of windy pride and hypocrisie. As Pope VRBAN the Second, to make the better speed for the recouerie of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> ordained that no Cleargie or Lay man should eat Flesh from <hi>Shrouetyde</hi> to <hi>Easter. [Guil. Malmes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For as nothing displeaseth God more, then the worship which we frame to him out of our owne fancifull braines: So no deuotion is of more value with vs, doth more please our humours, then such as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent our selues. So that it fareth with our Lent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with the young Ape; we so dote vpon it, so claspe and hug it, as, being the barne of our own braine we strangle it, so that such Lenten deuotion seldome suruiueth the time of Lent, but is dead all the yeere after. And what I pray you is all the Lent-fast, as it is generally vsed, but a meere apish imitation and mocke-fast? The example of CHRISTS Fast fourtie dayes and fourtie nights is brought by our Authour for vs to imitate. Well. Let our Authour begin to imitate CHRIST: Let him fast fourtie dayes, and fourtie nights, without eating and drinking, as CHRIST did; &amp; if he be able to endure such a Fast, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

is. Nor doe I see any reason, why such a keeping of Lent, as our Authour prescribes, should haue the name of a Past. For a Fast, is to eat nothing, and drinke nothing during the Fast. Nothing at all. If our Fast be for a day, we are to eat nothing till night, when the Fast is ended. Such was <hi>Nineueh</hi>'s Fast. Nor can that be a Fast of fourtie dayes, in which space any thing is eaten or drunke. But is that a Fast, to eat no Flesh, and to fill the stomacke with good Fish, and the best Wine? To eat no Butter, but the purest Oyle?<note place="margin">

   <p>And why should our Authour impose vpon vs such a Lent-Fast, as a matter of Religion, and a speciall part of his Deuotion? Whereas this Noble and Religious STATE doth not prescribe or inhibite the vse of any Creatures, but out of a ciuill regard, and for a ciuill end.

And doth not the KINGS Proclamation inioyne forbearance of Flesh during that time of the Spring, and that expresly for the increase of Cattle? But if our Authour will needs vrge the Authoritie of the Church for the Lent-Fast, I doe but referre him to the Order of Pope VRBAN the third afore cited.

with the seeming sanctitie, and superstitious solemnitie of a pretended Lenten Fast, which indeed is no Fast, as men doe vse it. And yet, for all it is so abused, it hath monopolized and ingrossed to it selfe all other true Fasts, wherein Gods people in time either of any present publicke calamitie, or eminent danger ought to be humbled, in making their peace with God, deprecating as the sinne, so the punishment, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fruit of it. But the<note place="margin">As the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, who will neither enter into Heauen himselfe, nor suffer those that would to enter in.</note> Lent-Fast must keepe out all, beat downe all other Fasts.

These, and other the like, be so likely to be true, as it may be lawfull for vs to belieue S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> MATHEVV wrot one thing, and spake another. But we must know, that the <hi>Misterie of Iniquitie</hi> began to worke euen in those prime times, while Satan want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his Instruments to lay the foundation thereof in superstitious Deuotions, the strongest supporter of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> As for S.

Neither is it necessarie, that we should either labour in all things to cleare the Fathers, nor in euerie thing to follow them. But howsoeuer our Authour would draw down the Lent-Fast from the obseruation of the Church:


<pb facs="38"/>
although he still meanes the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet wee know that the ancient Churches, which were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as all then were, ioynt members of the Catholike, did obserue their <hi>Quadrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima</hi> after a different sort, both for the time and manner. <hi>Socrates,</hi>

         <p>Also <hi>Zorom. Hist. Eccl. lib. 7. cap. 19.</hi>
         </p>
      </note> who was much about the time of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> saith that in those dayes, <hi>Qui sunt Roma, &amp;c. They that are at Rome, do Fast three weekes before Easter, the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the Lords day onely excepted.</hi> In <hi>Illyria,</hi> and all <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> they begin their Fast 6 weekes before Easter, and call that time <hi>Quadragesima.</hi> Others begin their Fast 7. weekes before Easter, although they keepe their Fast but 15. of those dayes, scattered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mong the rest; and yet they call that time <hi>Quadragesima</hi> too: Nor differ they onely about the time, but about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of abstinence. For some eate Fowles and Fishes, as both comming of the water; Others abstaine from shel-fruits, and eggs; some feed onely vpon drie bread: and others not that. Some after they haue fasted till nine of the clock, vse sundry meates: And others otherwise. And because none can shew any precept vpon Record concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lent, it is euident that the Apostle therein left free power to euery mans mind &amp; will, that euery one might do that which is good and honest, being induced thereto neither by feare, nor by necessity. Thus <hi>Socrates.</hi> And <hi>Eusebius</hi> before him saith, that some thought one day suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for fasting,<note place="margin">

      </note> some two, some moe, others in recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning 40. continued houres day and night, do determine that the time of their Fast. This being so, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Apostolicall Constitution for 40. dayes Fast, when it was left free for euery Church, or Christian, to fast as few or many dayes as they thought fit? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer let our Author obtrude vpon vs the authority and practise of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to impose a necessity of a religious, if not a superstitious 40. dayes Fast, when notwithstanding the old Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her purer times, fasted but three weekes, yet two dayes


<pb facs="38"/>
in euery weeke excepted. And besides, in those times, Easter being a generall time for publicke Baptisme, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Whitsuntide: for that cause they thought fit to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues with fasting and prayer, for the better preparation thereunto. But enough of this.</p>

         </gap> also into Hell, as vpon Easter Euen.</hi> The Author is very skilfull to tell vs the punctuall time of Christs Descent into Hell. Of the manner of it, or how the Article in the Creed is to bee vnderstood, he makes no question, but comes with an actuall downe right Descent. But he grounds this his time of Christs Descent into Hell, vpon the Epistle and Gospell for Easter Euen. Indeed the Epistle is taken out of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.27, &amp;c. where the words of <hi>Peter</hi> are thus translated, according to the corrupt vulgar Latin, <hi>In which spirit hee also went and preached to the spirits that were in prison, &amp;c.</hi> Now, the Author hereupon inferreth, that this place of <hi>Peter</hi> is to be meant of Christs Descent into Hell; contrary to all sound Interpreters; the Text it selfe no way bearing it. And vpon the same ground, according to the corrupt translation, wherein is added (contrary and besides both the Originall Text, and our last and best English Translation) these words, <hi>That were</hi>: whereas the Text is, <hi>To the spirits in prison,</hi> that is, now, still in prison; not, that were in prison, as if vpon Christs descent into Hell, and preaching vnto them, hee had deliuered them thence, as out of some Limbo; which the Author (if well examined) must needes meane. And indeed he is too much helped by the corrupting of the Text; so that it were to be wished, that vulgar English Translation of the Epistles and Gospels in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion booke were corrected, yea and wholly made vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to our last Translation of the Bible, that so no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish spirits may haue any such starting holes for their lurking and sly old Popish and mopish doctrines.</p>

<pb facs="39"/>
our Seruice and Sacrifice of Prayer and Prayse, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring them vp into the presence of his Father, yea and to make both vs and them acceptable to his Maiestie? But what promise of acceptance hath our Authour of such Mediation of Angels, if they should presume to present our Prayers? Much more, when they doe it without warrant. And warrant they haue none in GODS Word. And without the Word we haue no warrant for any seruice we doe to GOD. But contrarily the Word alloweth vnto vs but one onely Mediatour as well of Intercession, as of satisfaction. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sinnes.</hi> The same must be our Aduocate and Intercessor, who is also our Propitiation. Therefore our Authour here commits high Sacriledge, if not Blasphemie against the Sacred Maiestie of GOD, and the honour of IESVS CHRIST, to assigne GOD the appointing of a new way, whereby we may come vnto him, namely another way, then by IESVS CHRIST.</p>
   <p>But proceed we to Page 388. where he sets downe, The manner of commending the Soule into the hands of GOD at the verie point of time, when it is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Body.

Yet for all this he sets downe a farre longer prayer, then can be said at the <hi>verie point of time, when the Soule is departing from the Body.</hi> Yea and among the rest to lengthen it out, he sets downe thirteene eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatorie

their honours sake: Nay rather it is the more censura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the author should dare to attempt to seduce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honourable personage vnder the colour of his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-popish Deuotions. But what more? <hi>without any meaning to make the same publicke to the world.</hi> This is one part of his good intentions. Published it is, but it was not his meaning. How then? <hi>Though (to saue the labour and trouble of writing Copies, to be sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to some few friends) a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, by leaue and warrant of the Ordinary, were printed at the charge of the partie, for whose onely vse the same was collected.</hi> Good. Pitty, but such a Booke, with such deuout prayers collected, should be copied out, and rather then faile, for more expedition, to be printed; but to be sparingly (O warily spoken) to some (and but some) and those but a few friends. One of the best reasons you gaue hitherto, to extenuate the fault: for the fewer were printed, and the more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and to the more few communicated, the better. But how comes it to be printed againe and againe, and so lauishly communicated and dispersed euery where? Is it not, but by leaue and warrant of the Ordinary? I assure you the author had extraordinary fauour to get the Ordinaries leaue and warrant for such a Popish Booke; for beleeue me, Orthodox Bookes, and such as impugne Popery and Heresie, and propugne the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> cannot haue the fauour to obtaine ordinary leaue and warrant to be printed, but vpon (to speake mildely) extraordinary tearmes. But goe on. <hi>It hath therefore seemed good to AVTHORITY to giue leaue to the reprinting thereof, and permitting the same to be sold, to such as please to buy it, onely for priuate vse, as in former times way hath beene giuen to the printing of priuate Prayer-Bookes.</hi> Stay there, Me thinkes, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Printer, you begin to gather a great deale of confidence already. I pray you (if I may be so bold) what authority is that,


<pb facs="41"/>
which you so boldly build vpon, and which you put in such Capitall Characters, as if you would affright the Reader withall. But good Subiects, and honest men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, honour, reuerence, loue <hi>Authority,</hi> are not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it. It is for such <hi>Printers,</hi> that are so ready to print <hi>Mountebanke Arminianisme,</hi> and cos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ning Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as you haue done, to be frighted with Authority; for it <hi>carrieth not the sword for naught. But if thou dost euill, feare.</hi> Did you neuer heare of one <hi>Tucker</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, who, for printing a Booke of Popish Deuotion, was arraigned, and though the Queens mercy saued his life, yet he was confined to perpetuall imprisonment? Yet you feare not, not only to print, &amp; reprint, but to sell your booke to euery buyer, &amp; to some who exchange it also for all other bookes, which a little before was thought fit onely to communicate and but sparingly to some few friends, being set forth at first onely for the vse of the party, that bore the charge. But do you make no more difference betweene this Popish booke of priuate <hi>Deuotions,</hi> and other priuate prayer bookes formerly printed by <hi>Authority</hi> (and as good <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as you can bring any) in this Church? I pray you how long haue you beene a M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Printer? But a Young one I da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e say. Or how many such bookes haue you printed by <hi>Authority</hi>? Not many I am su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e of it, though too many by any. Surely it is but newly the change of the Moone, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ce such Bookes haue cropen vnder the wing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of <hi>Authority</hi> to fly abroad. If you reckon but from seuen yeeres agoe, there was then no such <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> extant in this Church, that would appeare to giue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to such base bookes as this of your printing. Therefore you see the case is altered. But I trust, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, when he comes to vnderstand how much his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> transferred vpon others, is dishonored, will take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the suppressing of such wicked bookes, which you are so ready to reprint. But all this while (for I cannot but bee iealous of the honour of mine Ordinary in this


<pb facs="42"/>
kind) I pray you in what maner was the Licence giuen? Speake the truth: For I heare, that you had onely a loose Paper for your warrant, not affixed to the booke, much lesse (as the ordinary maner is) the Licencers hand to the booke. So that, were ye not deceiued? Was it not some other booke of priuate <hi>Deuotion,</hi> mentioned or meant in the Approbation? Or if this were meant, yet hath not the Author added or altered at his pleasure. For the loose paper, did it set downe how many sheets it contained? A loose Approbation it was. And I suspected that your <hi>Authority</hi> was none of the best, or most authenticke, you doe so braue it out in your capitall Characters. But yet forasmuch as you had no other <hi>Approbation</hi> of this booke, but onely an <hi>Indiuiduum vagum</hi> written in a loose Paper; who (I pray you) gaue you <hi>Authority</hi> to set it so fast vpon the booke, with the whole strength and waight of your Presse? Doe you know what you haue done? you haue hereby affixed and impacted such an Aspersion of dishonour vpon our Reuerend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>san and Ordinary, as cannot be easily clawed off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore if you had had such a reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Ordinary, as you ought, you might both haue fauoured his honour, and saued your owne stake, keeping the <hi>loose Paper</hi> by you in your box, as your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance or discharge. But goe on with your learned Apologie M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Printer. <hi>Whereby it is presumed, all well disposed Christians may receiue satisfaction that there is not in it such cause of dislike, as it seemeth hath beene ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored.</hi> But what if any, yea a great many receiue not satisfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>? Is it purged from all that Popish dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> so aboundeth? It is imagined no, because it hath not yet felt the fire. Or is it growne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now, or brighter, as Iron, with wearing? Or what I pray you is done to the Booke, <hi>that all well disposed


<pb facs="42"/>
Christians may receiue satisfaction?</hi> Now truely (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) till now my dull pate did not apprehend your far fetcht reason.

         </gap>e is had to amend such escapes, as either by the Printers haste, or the Correctors ouersight were committed.</hi> This clause ioyning close vpon the former, confirmes me, that I haue not mistaken your meaning in the point of satisfaction by <hi>Authority.</hi> But if this your sentence had begun with [<hi>For</hi>] as, <hi>For, for the auoiding▪ &amp;c.</hi> we should haue expected some sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

But it is, <hi>And</hi>; which puts vs out of hope of any reason, but downe-right <hi>Authority,</hi> for satisfaction. Well, we must be faine to make the best of it, and instead of expecting the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of your booke, so backed with <hi>Authority,</hi> begin to correct our owne mistakings. What? was it rumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that among other exorbitances, this booke contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned prayer for the dead? Alas! it was but a mistaking. On whose part?

Although it were but an Escape, or so, and that committed either by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haste, or the Correctors ouersight. It is wel yet, that


<pb facs="43"/>
it proues not all this while some escape committed by the ouersight of the Collector, vnlesse you haue here mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed (being full perhaps of perplexed thoughts) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you set a good face on it) Corrector, for Collector. But for your part M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Printer, what needed such haste? There was no feare, least the Wardens comming to search, should take your Canonicall houres n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pping; for you had at least leaue and warrant from the Ordinary, for your first edition, though not as yet <hi>Authority</hi> in Capitall letters, wherby this your second correction was set forth. Nor were you printing then <hi>Burtons</hi> second part against <hi>Mountagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> or the like, that you should be in such haste. Or what haste was ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of that Booke? It might well haue beene spared hitherto, for ought I know. As though the <hi>Jesuites</hi> seduce not fast enough without it? But of all things, good Master Printer, beware of haste. Did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learne so much in your Latine Schoole (for I am sure you haue learned to speake vnhappy <hi>English) Canis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinans caecos parit eatul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s.</hi> And desire your Corrector to beware of ouersight; for I haue knowne that betweene the Printers haste, and the Correctors ouersight, soule escapes haue beene committed: as in the great Bible (and I beshrow them for committing the least escape in that blessed Booke, one tittle whereof shall not passe away, nor escape vnfulfilled) <hi>Iudas,</hi> was printed for <hi>Iesus.</hi> But I easily beleeue, that was in good earnest either the haste of the Composer, or the ouersight also of the Corrector, without any circumstances, or circumlocution. Well, an escape or ouersight acknowledged, and corrected, and withall a care had to preuent the like for afterwards, makes a full amends for all. Well: for the care you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, we must take your word. Yet forasmuch as you seeme here to speake in your owne defence, that all the rumours about your printed Booke was but vpon some escapes of the Printer, or ouersight of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector: you must giue vs leaue a little to examine the truth hereof, by comparing your first and second


<pb facs="43"/>
Impressions. Now reading ouer diligently both the Bookes, I find no difference at all betweene them, but only about <hi>Prayer for the Dead,</hi> which we last touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there we cānot come to discerne your escapes better, then by setting downe so much of both the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies one against the other, as is requisite at least for the more full satisfaction of all well disposed Christians.</p>

      <pb facs="44"/>Now Mr. Printer, I will not alone take vpon me to judge of these your escapes; but rather I referre you to the whole Bench of the most judicious and learned, yea and those graue and honourable Sages of the Councell-board. Onely this I dare say peremptorily, that in the first impression there is an expresse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall prayer for the Dead: but in the second it is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and corrected, and the case quite altered. And yet is all this but an escape of the Printer, or ouersight of the Corrector; But was not the Author himselfe the Corrector? was not his naturall affection ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly busied in licking his young Beere while it past the Presse, and receiued the perfect forme. Or being an escape of the Printer, how came not the Author himselfe, or some of those his neere and deare friends for him, first to espy the faults, and so to haue them corrected, before they came to be found out by others? For surely he and his had reason first to read ouer that priuate first impression, before it should come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen view; it being a booke not of an ordinary stampe, and which for the admirable ouerdaring of it, was like to runne a most desperate hazzard. But it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they would put it to a hazzard. They imagined, that haply it might passe vnespied; and then all would haue beene well enough, and you might haue spared your labour of printing your <hi>Epistle</hi> Apologeticall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the second Impression.</p>
   <p>But yet, Mr. Printer, you should haue done well (which would the more haue cleered the credit of your excuse, taking all the blame from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) to haue cancelled all that Paper, beginning, <hi>O Lord with whom do liue, &amp;c.</hi> Vnto these words, <hi>Wee most meekely &amp;c.</hi> Putting all those first six lines among your Errata,<note place="margin">See the Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniō booke, at the Buriall of the Dead.</note> or Escapes. For so much is a part of a gratulatory Collect vsed in the Communion Booke at the Buriall of the dead. So that vnlesse this prayer


<pb facs="44"/>
stand still in force for a prayer for the Dead, as it was in the first Impression: it is very improper for your second and corrected Booke. For euen your owne reason, Mr. Printer, may induce you to thinke, that it is improper to vse a Collect for a mans buriall, for him that is yet aliue, vnlesse you would bury the man quicke. And therefore me thinkes you were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill aduised, and seeme to haue for hast committed another fowle escape, in that you did not thorowly aduise with your Author about a more exact correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your escapes, that so the booke, vpon second and more mature cogitations, might haue passed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, aboue all exception, to the better satisfaction of all well disposed Christians. But did you consult with your Author, before you set vpon your corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? It may be feared noe. Otherwise it is hoped that the Author and his learned friends would haue thought better of the matter, then to haue suffered such an absurdity to stand still in the Booke, and that vpon a solemne correction. And therefore, what if they come vpon you, and disauoning it themselues, lay a further blame vpon you, then hitherto you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to your selfe? For besides, that such an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie brings their judgement in question, they may seeme to take vpon them to be Innouators, turning the Collects, which the Church of England hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the publike buriall of the dead, to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate visitation of the liuing sicke. So that, Mr. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for all your Apologies and Protestations, it is to be feared, that your Author will disclaime this your correction, as not done by his direction, but of your owne head, it being left so full of <hi>Non sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Non sequiturs.</hi> And what if he shall call in this your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Booke, and either put out those six lines, or else bring his <hi>Authoritie</hi> for the first to stand in full force, and then all will hold a due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>immetry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion?


<pb facs="45"/>
It will then be the more tollerable to borrow a peece of the Church Collect, being a thankesgiuing at the buriall of the Dead, &amp; turne it into a prayer (pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate at least) for the dead, then to vse it for the liuing. But how it was shuffled vp among you, you can best tell.</p>
   <p>But tell me in good sadnesse, Mr. Printer, are you perswaded, that any man but of common sense giues any credit to your Epistle? Or do you thinke your selfe euer a whit the wittier, or learneder, that like a Parrot you haue powred it out, being infused into you: But <hi>Dignum patellâ Operculum.</hi> Will any, trow you, take these grosse alterations, and cobled breakes, for Escapes of the Printer? Neuer so befoole your selfe.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding one thing remaines vnaltered: that in the same prayer he placeth the soules of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jsaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in a certaine place, which he calls, <hi>the region of light,</hi> but at the resurrection he allowes them Gods glorious Kingdome. This <hi>Region of light,</hi> in his prayer for the dead vnaltered: may well be taken for some <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> different from Gods glorious Kingdome, in the resurrection; And <hi>Limbus,</hi> and prayer for the Dead will well sort toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>But to returne to the rest of your <hi>Epistle,</hi> I pray you goe on where we left. You see what a trouble your Escapes haue put vs too. <note n="*" place="margin">The words of the Printers Epistle.</note>

   <p>But you proceed, and say, <hi>They</hi> doe with griefe obserue the maleuolency of some dispositions of these times; with whom a slip, or misprision of a word or two, as liable to a faire, and charitable vnderstanding▪ as otherwise, doeth not onely loose the thankes due for all the good contained in the worke, but also purchase to the author a reprochfull imputation of way▪ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Popish Deuotion, and apish imitation of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>superstition.</hi>

   <p>O good God. What a packe of hypocrisie, and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse absurdities, and shamelesse impudencie is here; All their damnable foysting in of popery, and that no lesse then infidell prayer for the dead, must be excused (for sooth) and all the blame laid vpon the maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of some dispositions of these times. And who are those, and why maleuolent? surely those, that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the craft of Iesuited spirits in these our dayes in broching grosse and palpable Popery, dare oppose themselues, and cry out against such bold attempts. These be the men of a maleuolent disposition in these times, and all because these times doe breed such Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirits. And therefore no maruaile if the author


<pb facs="47"/>
of this booke cannot but greeue, that his Popish booke cannot finde a generall approbation. <hi>But they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolent, as with whom a slip, or misprision of a word or two, &amp;c.</hi> But a word or two, at the most, misprinted, or misplaced, the matter of all this maleuolency. Nay, but a slip, or misprision of a word, or two. Why, we know that in Coyne, he that is the author of a slip, and would vent it for the Kings Currant Coyne, is guilty of treason. Now much more a slip, or false doctrine foysted in for Gods Currant siluer? such a slip once broched is an errour: but stiffly maintained, it becomes an heresie. And is not this such a slip here? A most wicked Popish doctrine was published by the Author, or Authors, in print; namely <hi>Prayer for the Dead,</hi> against the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and yet the Authors will not acknowledge it an errour, but put it vpon the Printer. But the thing it selfe cryes shame vpon the authors of such iuggling tricks. And if there had not beene some maleuolent dispositions in the world, to quarrell such impious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts giuen to Christ and his blessed truth maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of England, there had not beene so much as one word amisse, being all so exactly waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goldsmiths ballance, before it came to bee minted for currant; then, prayer for the dead would haue passed for a doctrine of the Church of England. But maleuolent dispositions haue troubled and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all.</p>
   <p>But it was nothing but the misprision of a word or two, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> liable to a fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ere, the quarrell is not about the slip of a word▪


<pb facs="47"/>
but of a positiue false doctrine. The question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer for the dead may not be taken as well in a good sense, as in a bad, Charity being judge. Yes, if blind &amp; popish Charity may be judge. Nor is it a word or two, but a whole solemne prayer, of many words and sentences, wherein the state of the dead is deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed for, and that in expresse words: After the soule is departed, <hi>Then</hi>▪ O LAMBE OF GOD, &amp;c. and, <hi>That he may receiue this body.</hi> How are these things as liable to a faire and charitable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as otherwise? Vnlesse it bee a charitable worke, to pray for our deare brother, after his soule is departed from the body, that in his passage betweene earth and heauen, which is a farre journey, he may not misse or mistake his way, by falling into the Pit of Hell or Purgatory? Or what faire and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable vnderstanding are these words liable to, when after our dead brother hath receiued a formall absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all his sins, which he hath committed in this life, yet he hath need to be prayed for▪ that he may escape the gates of Hell and the paines of eternall darkenesse? What other construction can be made of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
