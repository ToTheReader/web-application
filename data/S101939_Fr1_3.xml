   <p>There are foure sorts of Consciences: Some bad and unquiet, some bad and quiet, some good and unquiet, some good and quiet. For a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be bad and quiet is the worst temper that can be: Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have a bad unquiet then a bad and quiet conscience: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have a tormenting Tophet in the soul then a fools para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise: The best frame of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the good and quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: This is a<note n="*" place="margin">Laetitia bonae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae paradisus est anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum, hortus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciarum, ager bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis, templum Solomonis, aula Dei, habitaecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs sancti, <hi>Bernard.</hi>

<pb facs="5"/> Now this ensuing treatise will teach us how to purchase this precious jewel of a good and quiet conscience. A treatise very necessary in these unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dayes, wherein most people make no conscience to sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst conscience; and some have sinned so long against conscience as that they have lost all conscience of sinne. As<note n="*" place="margin">Multi Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ad judicium habent non ad reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> S. Augustine saith of the name of a Christian, so may I say of conscience, <hi>Multi conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam habent, non ad reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium sed ad judicium,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have a conscience for their
<pb facs="5"/> condemnation and not for their salvation. Conscience<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Domus animae,</hi> Guil. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiens.</note> it is the house of the soul: But this house lieth waste and is much ruinated and decayed in these times, wherein<note n="*" place="margin">Dum tempora superiora cum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paro, dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi plus▪ illos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae minus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buisse; nos contrà, sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae plus, conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae minus habere, <hi>Beza.</hi>
      </note> never more sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but never lesse conscience. Conscience<note n="*" place="margin">Praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</hi>
      </note> it is a private judgement-day before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick day of judgement: And it is an ill presage that most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will never stand upright in the court of heaven, because they stand accused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Conscience is Gods preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in our bosomes: And it
<pb facs="6"/> is a most certain rule; That that man that will not regard the preacher in his bosome will never regard the preacher in the pulpit. And the reason why the preacher in the pulpit doth no more good, is because the preacher in the bosome is so much despised and neglected. And therefore I doubt not but this book (these motives consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) will be very acceptable to all those that have or desire to have a good and quiet consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For as<note n="*" place="margin">Ʋnicui{que} liber est propria conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; &amp; ad hunc li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutiendum &amp; emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandum omnes alii invenli sunt.</note> S. Bernard most excellently saith, <hi>Every mans conscience is his book; and
<pb facs="6"/> all books are written to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and amend the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the book of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Let those that reade this book of conscience look into the book of their own conscience, and amend all the faults of that book by this book.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Authour of this book was a Minister very conscientious, and one that had a great abilitie given him by God to preach unto and work upon the consciences of people, to awaken the sleepie consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to inform the erroneous conscience, to settle the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="7"/> conscience, and to comfort the wounded conscience: his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were all dipt in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And therefore a subject of Conscience must needs be welcome from such a preacher. It is true that this birth is <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humum opus,</hi> and cometh out after the death of the Authour: But I hope it will be the more pleasing, to revive the memory of him whose life and labours were deservedly pretious in the esteem of Gods people. And if conscience, though for a while blind, and dumbe, and seared, and put out of all office, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb facs="7"/> at last be put into office, and made to see, speak and feel to the utter destruction of an impenitent sinner; why may not a discourse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though long ago preached, be suffered to revive and live for the salvation of those that shall have grace to reade it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right? especially considering that these sermons were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by himself in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time?</p>
   <p>Much I could say in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this worthie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, both in regard of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearisome pains in preaching,
<pb facs="8"/> consuming his own bodie to save the souls of others,<note place="margin">Praelucen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do pereo.</note> as also of his learning and exemplarie pietie: but I forbear. All that I will say is this; They that fully knew him did love and reverence him: and if any did disesteem him, it was because they did not fully know him. He is now a shining starre in the firmament of heaven. And there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people that will blesse God to all eternity for his pains. He needeth not our praises, but our imitation.</p>
   <p>All that I desire from you that reade this short treatise is
<pb facs="8"/> this; That ye would either get a good conscience by the reading of this book, or bring a good conscience to the reading of it. Labour to make an addition to the heavenly joyes of this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant of God by making this book a means to bring thy soul to those heavenly joyes which are at Gods right hand for evermore: which are joyes unspeakable and glorious, so great that,<note n="*" place="margin">Tanta est dulcedo coelestis gaudii, ut si una gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flueret in infernum, totam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni absor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret.</note> as S. Augustine saith, <hi>If one drop of the joyes of heaven should fall into hell, it would swallow up all the bitternesse of Hell.</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/> And that God would make you heirs of this joy, is the prayer</p>
