      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS LIFE OF OVRS,</hi> (Right Honourable, Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and worthie Catholikes (is à <hi>Rase,</hi> and course, in which we are to runne for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a goale. <hi>(1. Cor. 9.)</hi> It is a <hi>Wrastling</hi> for a garland of eternall glorie. <hi>(1. Cor. 9.)</hi> It is a <hi>Warfare,</hi> in which we are to fight against three mightie, knowne, and professed enemies, for no lesse then a Kingdome of Heauen. Our life, (as <hi>IOB</hi> saieth <hi>cap. 7.</hi>) is <hi>Militia super terram; A warfare,</hi> in which we stand alwaies vpon our guarde, alwaies in our armour, alwayes with weapon in hand: but it is a <hi>warfare on earth,</hi> for in heauen it is a peace; a labour here, a rest there; a sowing in teares here, a
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>reaping in ioy there; a storme here, a calme there; a troublesome sea here, a quiet hauen there; a battaile here, a triumph there; and there fore the Church is called <hi>militant</hi> here, <hi>triumphant</hi> there. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the husbandman laboureth in the field, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely at home: The wayfaring man trauelleth in his ware, takes his ease onely in his Inne: The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes tryumphed not in the same place, in which they waged warre, but made warre in forraine Countries for Townes, Prouinces, and Kingdomes, and tryūphed onely in Rome: So we must not looke for ease, peace, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, and garlandes in this life; but here we must prepare our selues to skirmishes, encounters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, and battailes, and in Heauen onely expect our Triumph. The children of Israel got not the land of promise, but by the dynt of the sword, by many encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and bloudie battailes: neither shall wee obtaine heauen, vnlesse we fight for it. <hi>Regnum coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vim patitur, &amp; violenti rapiunt illud,</hi> (Mat. <hi>11.</hi>) <hi>The Kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and the violent beare it away.</hi> If we will winne this Cittie, wee must lay siege vnto it by watching and praying. If we will enter it, we must make a breach by the batterie of good workes. If we will take quiet possession of it, we must make vvarre for it.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>2.</hi> So that the Church militant, is an <hi>armie,</hi> and an armie alwaies raunged in battaile array. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribilis vt Castrorum acies ordinata.</hi> (Cant. <hi>6</hi>) <hi>Terrible as the armie of a Campe set in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray:</hi> In which you shal see nothing but <hi>choros ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum.</hi> (Cant. <hi>7.</hi>) Companies of Campes. In which armie, the King is Christ; his General, is his
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>chiefe Vicaire; His Coronelles, are Patriarches, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and other Prelates; His Captaines, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Commaunders, are inferiour Priests and Pastours; His souldiers, are the rest of Christian troupes, and Companies. To the furnishing of this Armie, all the Sacraments of the new law are instituted and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Matrimonie</hi> peopleth this armie, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth it with men. <hi>Baptisme</hi> presseth and enrolleth them. <hi>Confirmation</hi> armeth them, and giueth them their militarie Marke and liuerie. The <hi>Sacred Eucharist</hi> vittaileth the Campe, and furnisheth it with munition bread. The Sacrament of <hi>Order</hi> createth Coronelles, Captaines, and such as are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. The Sacrament of <hi>Penance</hi> healeth, and cureth the souldiers, who in this warre are wounded, and euen reuiueth them, who are slaine and killed. <hi>Extreame vnction</hi> riddeth them, euen of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the woundes and diseases. And so all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are pressed to the warre, and ordained to fight. the whole Church is a raunged Armie, and euery Christian ought to singe that songe, which <hi>DAVID</hi> sunge against <hi>GOLIATH Benedictus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Deus meus, qui docet manus meas ad praelium. &amp; digitos meos ad bellum. (Psal. 42.) Blessed be our Lord my God, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth my handes to battaile, and my fingers to warre.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>3.</hi> In this Armie, you, (ô valiant and constant Catholikes) are placed, as in the most dangerous, so in the most honourable rancke and place. For as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall placeth there his most expert and hardie soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, where the enemies Canon playeth oftenest, the darts and arrowes flye thickest, the pikes are planted
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>like a wood most terriblie: so our King <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> vnder whose banner and colours you fight, knowing your vndaunted courage to be such that <hi>(absit verbo inuidia)</hi> you are the most valiant souldiers of the present Church militant: he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you against a wood of Pikes, against a shower of Bullets and Pellets, against the most furious assault, that the common enemie giueth to the Christian Armie, and Church militant of Christ.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>4.</hi> For whereas Christians amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> can buy their libertie of Conscience for money, you by no tribute can purchase such a fauour. And whereas in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other countries, the Magistrate layeth handes on Priests and Catholikes, only when he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them at Masse, or diuine seruice; you are sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for more diligently then theeues, murderers, and publike harlots, and are apprehended, euen in the streetes and fieldes. And although in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> Catholikes haue heretofore endured intollerable pillages, cruell deathes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet that furie lasted onely a while, whilest the furie of heresie raged in her hoate beginning: but against you the like furie hath long continued. That cruelty was practised onely by way of tumult, but against you the like sharpnes hath bin vsed, vnder the colour of law, &amp; shew of iustice: So that no Nation, no people Christian endureth at this day for Christ his Church, and her Pastours authoritie, that which you haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for these many yeares, without interruption. And whereas the more raging the Tempest is, the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is appeased: &amp; the more furious &amp; bloudie the battaile is, the sooner it is ended: you haue this long ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me suffered a violent and furious persecution, and yet
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>you see no ende of this furie, yea, no hope of an ende, by humane meanes, oulde statutes being still renewed, new enacted. So that you are placed in that place of Christs Armie, which is exposed to the greatest furie of the Enemie: yea, you are set as a Butt or marke, against which, the enemies of Gods Church, are permitted to discharge all their Artillarie, and to emptie the quiuers of all the pearsing arrowes of afflictions, against you: and fo you may say as <hi>IOB</hi> did <hi>(Iob. 16.) Posuit me quasi signum. He bath set me to him selue as it were a marck</hi> to shoote at. And seeing that he bath bene so long a spectator of these shottes, and furious assaultes, it seemech he taketh delight and pleasure, not in your enimies crueltie and furie, but in your dexteritie in warding, constancie in keeping your standing, patience in suffering and enduring.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>5.</hi> And truely your afflictions seeme to me, neither inferiour, nor vnlike to those of <hi>IOB,</hi> and your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence seemeth to match and to aequalize his; only the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your afflictions seeme different. For he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted first in his goods, thē in his person; you cōtrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, first in your bodies and liues; now in your goods and liuings. The <hi>Sabeians</hi> haue rushed in vpon you, as well as on <hi>IOB,</hi> and haue spoyled many of you, impouerished the rest. <hi>Irruerunt Sabei, tulerunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que omnia. (Iob. 1.) The</hi> Sabeians <hi>came in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, and haue taken all things from you, the fire also of God, fell from heauen, and striking the sheepe</hi> (of <hi>IOB,</hi>) <hi>and the seruants hath consumed thē. (Iob. 1.)</hi> and a fire not from heauen (vnlesse by diuine permission) but frō earth, yea, from hell, and the vnquenchable thirst of hauing, hath consumed all your substance. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> made
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>three troupes to inuade the Camels of <hi>IOB,</hi> &amp; stroke his seruants with the sword. <hi>(Iob 1.)</hi> So haue they by three troupes, to wit, <hi>Concupiscentia carnis</hi> Concupiscence of the flesh. <hi>(1. Ioan. 2.) Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentia oculorum,</hi> concupiscence of the eyes, and <hi>Superbia vitae,</hi> pride of life, inuaded you: because to satisfie their lust and carnalitie, their auarice, desire of riches, and all that may be seene by the eyes, their pride and ambition of greatnesse, they haue made hauocke of all you haue. A vehement winde blowing boysteroussly from the countrey of the Defert, shooke the foure Corners of <hi>Iobs</hi> house, which falling, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his Children. <hi>(Iob. 5.)</hi> The like whirle winde, from the North, and desert of heresie, hath shaken your houses, and by their fall, hath ruinated your families, oppressed your persons, your wiues and children.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>6.</hi> And least the deuill should exprobate vnto you, as he did to <hi>IOB,</hi> that hetherto your goods haue rather suffered, then you; and that therefore if God would touch your bodie, and corporal life, hee should soone see you breake out into impatience (<hi>because skinne for skinne, and all things that a man hath, he will giue for his life, Iob. 2,</hi> God hath permitted Satan, by his ministers, to haue power ouer your bodies, and corporal life also, as appeareth by the prisons, in which some of you haue rotted, some haue statued, some haue been choaked with stincking ayres, as may easilye bee seene by the rackes, in which your ioyntes haue been dissolued, by the Tyburnes, on which you haue been hanged, and vnder which you haue been most butcherlie quartered, &amp; vnbowelled. Yea, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your affliction, many of you haue not wanted a <hi>IOBS</hi> wife, carnal and worldly loue, to busse in your
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>eares that Carnall counsell, <hi>Benedic Deo &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, (Iob. 2. (Curse God and die;</hi> Doe against thy Conscience, frequent hereticall seruice, take the oath of pretended Alleageance, rather then vndoe thy selfe, thy wife and Children: Yet you haue not fayled with <hi>IOB,</hi> to reprehend such a wise, and tell her that <hi>shee hath spoken like one of the foolish woemen. (Iob. 2.),</hi> as Sir <hi>THOMAS MORE</hi> told his wife, that she was a foolish marchant, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell him to sell eternitie, for shorte and vncertaine time. Many also of you haue not wanted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes of your bloud and stocke, prefigured by <hi>IOBS</hi> false and fained friends <hi>(Iob. 2.)</hi> who haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perswade you, that these miseries, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse you, are befallen you for your obstinacie in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and yet you haue repelled such deceauing friends; yea, you haue cast from you such scandalyzing eyes, that is, you haue shaken off such friends, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as deare and necessarie vnto you, as your eyes, and haue chosen rather to goe to heauen blinde <hi>(Matt. 8.)</hi> then to be directed by such ill-guyding eyes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>8.</hi> But seeing that God hath not permitted Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to haue power ouer your soules, but onely ouer your transitorie goods, and mortal liues, loose ye not either hart or courage. Sathan indeede, by his Ministers (as one telleth you) hath broken downe the walles of your house, as no maruaile, it was but of clay, but he could not lay handes on your soule (the good man of the house) that being forbidden him; he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the chest of your bodie; and no maruaile, it was but of rotten board; but he could not finger the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your faith, Gods grace, and such like Iewels, they being locked vp in the Cabinet, of your conscience,
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>of which God and you onely keepe the key. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be yee not dismayed, for the losse of your temporal goods, liuings, and libertie, yea, corporal life, seeing the principal (the soule) is safe, so long as you will. But for all temporal losses, giue God thankes, and say with <hi>IOB, Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit, sit nomen Domini benedictum.</hi> God gaue all this, &amp; he hath taken all awaie, be he praysed as much for the taking awaie, as for the giuing.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>8.</hi> And doe you not imagine, that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken you in permitting this pillage of your goods, and sackage of your estates, for such goods are common to the good and bad: rather take it for a signe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie loue, in giuing you patience to beare with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie all those oppressions; and perswade your selues that <hi>necesse erat, quia accepti eratis Deo, vt tentatio probaret vos. (Tob. 12.)</hi> It was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, because you were acceptable to God, that this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation should prooue you. God hath indeede cast you into a fornace of tribulation, but as the Potter doth his earthen vessel, to harden it, not to breake it: or as the Goldsmith doth his golde, to purge it, not to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ume it. He hath indeede chastised you, but as his dearest children, not as seruants, and out of his loue, more then out of anger, as hee hath dealt with his Apostles, his Martyrs, yea, his Mother, yea his Sonne, and all his dearest. For it is his manner, <hi>to chastice whom he loueth, and to scourge euery childe that hee receaueth. As vnto children hee offereth himselfe vnto you. For wat sonne is there, whō the father doth not correct? (Heb. 12.)</hi> And when the correction is done, he will embrace you, and cast the rodde into the fier. It is true, he hath
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>wounded you, but as the Surgeon doth, to let out the corrupt matter. <hi>He woundeth and cureth, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and his hands shal heale</hi> (Iob. <hi>5.</hi>) And, <hi>the arrowes of our Lord, are in you, (Iob. 6.)</hi> as they were in <hi>IOB,</hi> but they are as tents, which hee will pull out, when they haue drawen out all corruptiō. He hath permitted the winde of persecution, to beat furiously vpon you, but it is to blow away all chasse of imperfection, and that the solid wheate of your vertues may be the purer. He hath permitted you to be pilled, polled, and spoyled of your goods, but that spoyling is but lopping and pruning, that the tree hereafter may beare his fruits more aboundantly.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>9.</hi> Say not there fore, God hath forsaken vs, hee thinketh no more of vs; and if your enemies say, <hi>Deus dereliquit eos, persequimini &amp; comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite eos, quia non est qui eripiat. (Ps. 70.)</hi> God hath forsaken them, follow them and apprehende them, there is none to deliuer them: beleeue them not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere them: <hi>Non derelinquit Deus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumentes de se.</hi> (Iudith. <hi>6.</hi>) God doth not forsake them that presume of him. Tell them that you are of the Church, to which God promised, <hi>quod non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabitur vltra derelicta &amp; terra, eius non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabitur amplius desolata, sed vocabitur vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas Dei in ea.</hi> (Isa. <hi>62.</hi>) That she shal no more be called forsaken, and her land shal no more be called desolate, but she shall be called, the will of God in her. And when you behould Englands present desolate state, &amp; compare it with her former glorie it had, weepe not as the lewes did at the sight of their second Temple. <hi>(ESDRAS 3.)</hi> For peraduenture, <hi>Magna erit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria domus istius nouissimae, plusquàm primae.
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>(AGGEI 2.)</hi> Great shal be the glorie of this last house, more then of the first. And peraduenture at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, England., though all dustie and slurred with the dust and bloud of this battaile, in which she fighteth, is more glorious in the eye of God, then when she flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in her Churches, Monasteries, and Colledges, and shined in her golden peace. Be not astonished at the sight of the troupes and forces, which the enemy hath brought into the field against you, nor do you cry at such a fight with <hi>ELIZEVS</hi> seruant, <hi>Heu, Heu, Domine mi, quid faciemus? (4.</hi> Reg. <hi>6.) Alas, Alas, My Lord, what shall we doe?</hi> for there are <hi>more with you, then with them.</hi> Lift vp your eyes to heauen, and you shal see moe in that mountaine prepared to fight for you, then are in the valley of this world, that fight against you. You shal see your Genera <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> (whome S. <hi>Steuen</hi> saw standing) readie to assist you, who giueth courage to your heart, force to your arme, edge to your sworde, and who with his heauenly troupes of Saints and Angels fighteth for you, and in you; else a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such forces you could neuer haue consisted; much lesse could you haue daiely encreased forces and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And yet you see your Seminaries, where your souldiers are trayned, are as full as euer, and nowe (thankes be to God) new forces of new Colledges and Monasteries, both of men and woemen (whose sexe is not debarred from this warre) doe adioyne them selues vnto you, armed with as great zeale as euer, with as much courage &amp; dexteritie in fighting as euer, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by your <hi>Atkinsōs, Thulises, Maxfieldes, &amp; Helmes,</hi> who euen this yeare, by dying in the fielde, discouraged &amp; discōfited their olde Aduer saries. These
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>troupes of souldiers, promisse one day a victorie: This seede sowen in teares, prognosticateth one day a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest: These materials so well hewed and fashioned, assure vs, that so wise an Architect as is <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> would neuer haue made them so readie for the building, had he not intended the reedisying of our defaced Temple, and ruinated Church of England.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>10.</hi> And although your General delay your victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and suffer you many times to be ficercely assaulted, yet it is but to make your victorie more glorious: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, when the storme of persecution bloweth so boysterously, that your Shippe may seeme in daunger of Shipwracke, he seemeth to sleepe, and not to heede you, yet it is but to make you cry vnto him with <hi>S. PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, Domine salua nos, perimus. O Lorde saue vs, we perish:</hi> Although he seeme sometimes readie to leaue you, and to goe from you, yet he doth but <hi>fingere se longius ire,</hi> (Luc. <hi>24.</hi>) <hi>make sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blāce to go further,</hi> thereby to giue you occasiō to cry with the two Disciples, <hi>Mane nobiscū Domine, quoniā aduesperascit: Tarry with vs, ô Lord, because it waxeth with vs to watdes night, ād the day is now farre spēt:</hi> Although he seemeth to haue takē all humane meanes frō you, &amp; euē that hope, which at the first you put in your Princes presumed Clemencie, and noble disposition, yet it is but to make you rely more on God, and not to put your confidence in Princes, in the sonnes of men, in whom there is no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(Ps. 145.)</hi> For otherwise, those oppressions of so many Innocēts, the equitie and iustice of your cause, the impietie and vengeance-crying sinnes of your aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the extremitie of your miseries and afflictions, doe pleade for mercie towardes you, iustice against them.</p>

      <hi>13.</hi> Onlie looke that there be no <hi>ACHAN</hi> nor <hi>ANATHEMA</hi> amongst you <hi>(Iosue 7.)</hi> for if there bee, God will take your wonted courage from you, and the Citie of <hi>HAI</hi> will preuaile against you. For as God is so mercifull that he spareth some tymes a whole Citie or kingdome, for the merites of a few, as he was readie to haue spared <hi>SODOME</hi> if he had found teniust men in it <hi>(Genes. 18.)</hi> for iust men (as S. <hi>AMBROSE</hi> sayth lib. <hi>1.

VVherfore (VVorthie Catholickes) the best meanes that I find to procure you a relaxation from this your so long persecution, is to follow the counsell, which the <hi>Ammonite ACHIOR</hi> gaue to <hi>HOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERNES (Iudith 5.) Perquire si est aliqua ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas &amp;c.

For as <hi>S. HIEROM</hi> sayth episi. <hi>13. Nostris peccatis barbari fortes sunt, nostris vitiis Romanus fugatur exercitus.

<pb n="17" facs="9"/>by our vices.</hi> But, as <hi>ACHIOR</hi> sayd: <hi>Si non est of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensio populi huius coram Deo suo (Iudith. 5.) If there bee no offence of God amongst you,</hi> your enemies shall not lōg preuaile, because God, whose cause you sustaine, will fight for you, and in you.</p>

I meruaile not, that after so heauie oppressions so long endured, you grone with the Israelites <hi>(Exod. 2.)</hi> I meruaile not, that after so furious assaultes so long sustained, some giue backe, and forsake their place and standing: for what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that in so great a winde some chasse is blown away? that amongst so many vessels put into the fornace of tribulation to be hardened, some breake in the hardening? for <hi>vasa figuli probat fornax &amp;c. the fornacetryeth the potters vessels, &amp; the tentation of tribulation iust men. (Eccl. 27.)</hi> Rather I meruaile that in so great a storme &amp; trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Sea, so few do suffer Shipwrack; and in so great a heape of wheate, so litle chasse is found; and amongst so many peeces of gould, which haue been cast into the fier, so few proue light and counterfet. Yet I feare also least your late giuing backe make the
<pb n="18" facs="10"/>enemie with more bouldnes to presse vppon you; and that the late Anathema, which is fallen amongst you, hath prouoked the wrath of God against you, and hath giuen courage to your enemie, taken it from you, and hath added surie to him, diminished zeale and feruour in you.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>15.</hi> You know what I meane: it is the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Oath,</hi> which because it goeth vnder the name of <hi>Ciuil Alleageance</hi> gratefull to such good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects as you are, whom Religion and conscience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to obey, feare, loue, and serue your Prince, hath deceiued some of you, and hath made you vnder this alluring bayte, to swallow downe the hooke that galleth euen the soule and conscience, and in this goulden cup to drinke your deadlie poison and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that I may say vnto you: <hi>Anathema est in medio tui Israel, non poteris stare coram hostibus tuis, donec deleatur ex te, qui hoc contaminatus est scelere, (IOSVE 7.) There is Anathema in the middest of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee</hi> (or his sinne in him) <hi>that is contaminated with this wicked fact.</hi> VVherfore, O VVorthie Catholickes, <hi>let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sticke in your hādes of this Anathema, that our Lord may be turned from the wrath of his furie, and may haue mercie on you.

   <p>
      <hi>16.</hi> You are not ignorant, that <hi>modicum fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum totam massam corrumpit (1. Cor. 5.) A little leauen corrupteth the whole paste.</hi> One mortall sinne mortifieth all your former merites, <hi>(D. Th. 3. p. q. 89. a. 4.)</hi> and he that offendeth in one
<pb n="19" facs="10"/>point, especiallie pertaining to faith and the Churches power &amp; right, <hi>is made guiltie of all (Iac. 2.)</hi> This one hole, which the persecutour hath made in the ship of your soule, is sufficient to let in that water which will drowne you: this one point of your chiefe visible Pastours Authoritie and power, which (though forced therunto) you abiure, is sufficient to disgrace all former constant and glorious Confession. And it will little auaile you to haue layed your hand to the plough, if now you looke backe; to haue runne so well hetherto, if now you faint before the goale; to haue resisted hetherto so va iantlie, if now you yeeld your selues slaues to tyrannie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>17.</hi> And although some one persuadeth you, that you may with safe conscience take this <hi>oathe,</hi> and therefore are not bound with hazard of your estates to refuse it, yet beleeue it, <hi>persuasio haec non est ex eo qui vocat vos: this persuasion is not of him that calleth you (Gal 5.)</hi> for as <hi>S. PETER</hi> telleth you: <hi>In hoc vocati estis you are called to this, to doe well, and sustaine patientlie, (1.

VVherfore seeing that by this <hi>oath</hi> the true and lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritle of your chiefe visible head and Pallour is abiured (as this booke will make plaine vnto, you) imitate the wise serpent, expose bodie, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, libertie, and all, for the defence of your Head: and if your zealous Pastour and Primat <hi>S.

         </gap>istowes, Stapletons,</hi> who had as great a care of your temporall, and more of your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall estates, and yet wrote, and taught, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which this oath abiureth, is to be defended with hazard of liuings and life. To these I'desire you to adde the Coūcels, not only Prouincial, but also General, which in their decrees haue defined this authoritie; the Popes so many, so learned, so holie, who haue exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized it vpon rebellious Princes; the Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours (though most herein interessed) who haue acknowledged it; the arguments also deducted out of Scripture, and Principles of faith and Diuinitie, which do conuince it, (all which this booke will make known vnto you) and lastly the fatherlie admonition of your most Holie Father and chiefe visible Pastour <hi>PAVL</hi> by the Grace of God the fifte of that name, who as by office he hath a generall charge and care of all Christian Nations, so hath he a particular care, not only of the spirituall, but also of the temporall estates of all English Catholikes, as our Colledges haue, and do daiely experience, and consequentlie would not expose your temporall estates to the furie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour, by forbidding you this <hi>oath,</hi> if (as he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you) it did not containe thinges, which can not be sworne without <hi>euident and grieuous wronging of Gods honour, and which are
<pb n="21" facs="11"/>flat contrarie to faith and saluation. (Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> 5. <hi>in Breu.)</hi> And therfore seeing that hee, like a wise and carefull Phisitian, hath more care of your health, then of contenting your tast and humour; and <hi>VViddrington</hi> contrariewise permitteth you that which is pleasing to flesh, and bloud, not so much respecting how preiudicious it is to your soules health; if you will preferre heauen before a temporall estate, and the soule before the bodie, you must also preserre your Holie Fathers counsel and admonition, especiallie grounded in such authoritie, before all the smooth and soothing prescriptions in the world, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rāted by onlie <hi>Widdringtons,</hi> and some few obscure Authors authoritie: for although he alleadgeth often the Doctors of <hi>Sotbon,</hi> and all the state of <hi>France,</hi> yet by the late resistance made by the Clergie, and nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> against the like <hi>Oath,</hi> who seeth not how he abuseth his reader and iniureth that noble Monarchie?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>19.</hi> But put the case you should preferre <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringtons</hi> counsel before your chiefe Pastours ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and all the authoritie alleadged, neither so (what soeuer he beareth you in hand) should you saue your temporall estates, or decline persecution. For to omitte that if you had at the first iointlie and couragionslie resisted the <hi>oath,</hi> it is like you should neuer haue been so hoatlie pressed with it; if now you should all resolue to accept of it, neither so should you auoide persecution. For (as I haue tould you) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce your yeelding in this point hath prouoked your heauenlie Fathers wrath, and induced him in this his so iustlie conceiued anger, to vse or permitt still the rodd of persecution, which otherwise he was
<pb n="22" facs="12"/>readie to haue layed aside: and the persecutour, who proposeth this oath, not seeking so much the Princes securitie (which rather hereby, as I haue shewed in the last chapter of this booke, is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered) as the molestation of your Consciences, and the pillage of your goods, would not, though you should accept of this <hi>oath,</hi> surcease therfore from persecution; but if he could not by this meanes molest your consciences, and ruine your estates, he would try other meanes, as to compell you to their Churches or prophane Communion. And this you may gather by his sorrow he shewed, when in the beginning so many of you yeelded to take this <hi>oath;</hi> and by this also, that many, who haue taken this oath, can not so free them selues from molestation, because nothing but your goods and miseries can satisfie the vnsatiable crueltie of bloudie persecutours. And so by yeelding to this <hi>oath,</hi> as you prouoke Gods greater anger, so you moue the persecutour to no compassion; rather you make him more insolent, and redouble your owne miserie. But suppose you could thus shake of this h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>auie yoke of persecution, yet it beeing vnlawfull (as your chiefe Pastour and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>10.</hi> Many thinges do make this <hi>oath</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, as you will easilie perceaue by the briese exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which the last chapter of this treatise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it; but if there were nothing but this, that it is an vncouth and vnwonted oath, neuer yet proposed by any Prince vnto his subiects, and proposed also by the professed Enemies of Gods Church, all Catholikes that feare to offend God, or to doe iniurie to the Church, and her right and authoritie, ought to holde it as suspected, and as such to shunne it, and auoyd it. For it is no new thing for heretikes vnder colour of oathes of fidelitie and ciuil alleageance to deceaue the well meaning and nought-suspecting Catholike. VVee read in the historie of the persecution of the <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, (Victor Vticen. lib. 3. de pers.

The oath seemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

But I haue for such an answer in readines, to wit, that I am not ignorant of your extreame afflictions, and that (as I protest) I neuer thinke of your suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances seriouslie, but I suffer with you sensiblie, and would, if so I might ease you, spend my blood, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my life, euen for a relaxation from your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miseries: but being perswaded as I am, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon so sure grounds, as this <hi>Treatise</hi> will manifest vnto you, as that Phisition were vnworthie his Profession, that would prescribe onely such Phisick to his patient as is pleasing to his tast, not caring how contrarie it be to his health, so if I, with a <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington,</hi> would seeke to soothe, and sute a worldlie humour, and so my speeches be pleasing to flesh and bloud, little regard the health and state of your soules and securitie of your consciences, I were vnworthie the roome I fill, the person I sustaine, and the function of a Spiritual Physition, which I haue vndertaken. VVherfore if my Physick be distastfull, refuse it not, it being healthfull; neither be you angrie with the Physition for prescribing so bitter a potion, he therby intending your good: and if my speeches seeme too plaine, thinke they are sincere and spoken out of loue; if sharpe and byting, persuade your selues that

      <hi>meliora sunt vulnera diligentis, quàm frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulenta oscula odientis: (Prou. 27.) Better are the wounds of him that loueth, then the fraudulent kisses of him that hateth.</hi> This I am sure, I giue you no other counsell, then I would follow my selfe, who haue that opinion of the vnlawfulnes of this oath, that I would loose liuings, libertie, and life, rather then take it: not that I would not giue that to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which is due to <hi>Caesar,</hi> but that I would not take from God which appertaineth to God: not that I neglect a temporal life and state, but that I preferre the spirituall: not that I despise the Prince, to whom I acknowledge all tempor all obedience and honour, but that I honour the Pastour, who hath the rule of my soule: not that I regard not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but that I desire to liue and dy an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient sonne of the Church: not that I feare not them, <hi>who can kill the bodie,</hi> but that I feare God more, <hi>who can kill the soule:</hi> Matt. <hi>10.</hi>

      <hi>23.</hi> And my intention and proiect (I protest) of dedicating this Treatise vnto you, was not to irritate any Prince, but onlie to declare his Authoritie and office; not to flatter any Prelate, but onlie to defend his right; not to increase your persecution, but to ridde you of this <hi>Anathema,</hi> which hath prolonged it; not to adde affliction to affliction, but courage to your fainting, and comfort to your griefes, to helpe them to rise that are sallen, and to confirme them that stand, that they may the better keepe their standing. And this being my sincere intention, I hope not onlie you, but all others, who shall peruse this booke, will make their profit of it, and interpret it in that good meaning, which the Authour intended. Our Lord

      <hi>IESVS,</hi> for whose cause you endure, either ease you of this burden of aduersities, vnder which you grone, or giue you strength to beare it, comfort in bearing, and make mee a follower of your rare examples, an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour of your patience, and partaker of your merits, as you shall euer be of my poore prayers and small labours.</p>
