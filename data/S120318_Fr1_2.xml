   <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T standeth not either with my occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or my liking, to make a long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to that discourse, which of it selfe seemeth to me ouerlong. Onely giue me leaue to informe the vnlearned of some few things, which may further him in the vnderstanding of it. The manner of my answer is such, as I haue vsed in my former writings. First I set downe the Papists Treatise word forword: then I draw it into a right forme of reasoning, that the truth may more euidently appeare: Lastly, I frame as direct and plaine an answer to it, as conueniently I can with shortnesse. If thou desire fully to conceiue the whole course of this kind of answering, I must intreate thee to haue recourse to the Preface, which I set before my answer to the 12 Articles; where the matter is deliuered largely and plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For the vnderstanding of this present answer, it may suffice thee to know what is the meaning of certaine words of Art, as we call them, which I am inforced to vse very often. First then, a Syllogisme is a certaine forme of reasoning, which consisteth of three sentences, whereof the second is drawne out of the first, and the third ariseth as a conclusion
<pb facs="3"/>
from them both. The first of these three, is called the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or Maior: the second the Assumption or Minor; both of them ioyntly together are named the Antecedent: the third is termed the Consequent or Conclusion. Therefore if I denie the Antecedent of a Syllogisme, I meane to signifie that both the Proposition and the Assumption are false: so must you conceiue seuerally, that which soeuer of the three sentences I deny, that I take to be false. The consequence is the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of one vpon another: so that when I say, I deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, my meaning is, that the latter part doth not follow vpon the former: for example, pag. 47. you haue this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme:
<list>
         <item>
            <label>Antecedent.</label>
            <hi>Propos.</hi> If faith cannot be one vnlesse it be entire, then it must be entire.</item>
         <item>
            <label>Antecedent.</label>
            <hi>Assūp.</hi> But faith cannot be one, vnlesse it be entire.</item>
         <item>
            <label>Consequent.</label>
            <hi>Concl.</hi> Therefore it must be entire.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>My answer to this Syllogisme is, I deny the consequence of your Proposition, that is, I say, it doth not follow that faith must be entire, if it cannot be one, vnlesse it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
   <p>There is also another forme of reasoning, called an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme, which indeed is nothing else but an vnperfect Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme, consisting of either part of the Antecedent, and of the Consequent. To this I answer, by denying either the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent or the Consequence. For example, pag. <hi>177.</hi>
      <list>
         <item>Our Sauiour himselfe citeth some words out of that Chapter, and expoundeth them to be fulfilled in himselfe.</item>
         <item>Therefore that Chapter is to be vnderstood of our Sauiour Christ and his Church.</item>
      </list>
To this Enthymeme I answer thus: this Consequent doth not follow vpon that Antecedent, which is all one, as if I should
<pb facs="3"/>
haue said, I deny the Consequence, that is, I say, that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not therefore to be vnderstood of our Sauiour Christ and his Church, because our Sauiour citeth some words out of it, and expoundeth them to be fulfilled in himselfe. An example where the Antecedent is denied, though the Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme be not plainly set downe, you haue pag. 327.
<list>
         <item>The Pope is Peters successor:</item>
         <item>Therefore he cannot erre.</item>
      </list>
Here I deny the Antecedent, that is, I say it is false, that the Pope is Peters successor. And this may serue for sufficient instruction to the vnlearned, that they may be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and iudge both of the reasons and the answers to them. It remaineth that I cōmend thee Christian Reader, whosoeuer thou art, that vnfainedly desirest the aduancing of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by thine owne saluation, to the gracious direction of the holy Spirit, that he may teach thee to vnderstand and beleeue to the praise of his name, and thy present and euerlasting comfort, through Iesus Christ our onely Lord and Sauiour. Amen.</p>
