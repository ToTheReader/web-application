   <p>THE Law promisseth (G. P). all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this world, &amp;, when this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly
house of tabernacle is dissolved, a buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
from God everlasting, yf we kepe it:
But without any token that men wold ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
it, breaking upon breaking is foretold:
&amp; eight and twenty fold punishmentes,
until at the last Iudah should lose their
Land and be seaventy yeares in the Land
of Nemrod: wher they might behold the
wicked building: which bred confusion of
tongues: and which should end the tōgue
of Adam from comon use. VVhen the first
yere of this captivitie was beginning: Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
penned a forme of lamentatiōs: shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="6"/>
mans misery to the full. and the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of Salomons howse, which from
Roboam was Ammonitish: and from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chozias
was Achabish: and was often nere
rooting out. that men might better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve
it should wholy decay: and loke unto
the family of Christ the sonne of Nathan
Salomons brother. The Godly in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
as Daniel, who stopped the mouth
of Liones, and Ananias, Misael, with Asa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rias,
who quenched the force of fyre, were
humbled by these Lamentationes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the dayes of Christ. And presently
from theyr begining Daniel beginneth
his captiuity: as a witness to Ieremies
trueth; and sheweth how God in sorowes
advaunced him to be welthier then migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Kinges; and contrived the Kingdomes
which thence should afflict faithfull Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs
religion, vnto the forme of one mās
body: and distinct in matter, as Iudahs zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
or relenting wold be. Ieremyes Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
I have set over into our tongue;
with care to set forth, so nere as our speach
<pb facs="6"/>
could, the oratorious bravery of his
wordes. But all men, yea all Grekes,
though theyr learning &amp; eloquence were
powred into one head, wold come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nere his heavenly gaynesse. They
must lerne his owne language that wold
fill theyr eares with those soundes of Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naan.
Besides his translation, I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his meaning so far as I demed nede was;
for his conferēce with the other holy wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.
And him I joyned to Koheleth,. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I finished that work which was sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to your G. in Ebrew and Latin which
hādleth Davids Families &amp; Daniels sūme.
That I have also turned into mo lāguages;
as conteyning an explication of comon
Christianity. These I laboured, that your
G. might by ripe yeres, be ripe in the know
ledg of God.</p>
