   <head>CERTAINE VSEFVL ADVERTISEMENTS SENT in a Letter written by a discreete friend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Planters in <hi>New England,</hi> at their first setting saile from Southhampton, who earnestly desireth the prosperitie of that their new Plantation.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ouing and Christian friends, I doe heartily and in the Lord salute you all, as being they with whom I am present in my best affection, and most earnest longings after you, though I be constrained for a while to be bodily absent from you, I say constrained, God knowing how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and much rather then otherwise I would haue haue borne my part with you in this first brunt, were I not by strong necessitie held backe for the present. Make account of me in the meane while, as of a man deuided in my selfe with great paine, and as (naturall bonds set aside) hauing my better part with you. And though I doubt not but in your godly wisedomes you both foresee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vpon that which concerneth your present
<pb facs="5"/>
state and condition both seuerally and ioyntly, yet ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e I thought but my dutie to adde some further spurre of prouocation vnto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet because I owe it in loue and dutie.</p>
   <p>And first, as we are daily to renew our repentance with our God, speciall for our sinnes knowne, and generall for our vnknowne trespasses; so doth the Lord call vs in a singular maner vpon occasions of such difficultie and danger as lieth vpon you, to a both more narrow search and carefull reformation of our wayes in his sight, lest he calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance our sinnes forgotten by vs or vnrepented of, take aduantage against vs, and in iudgement leaue vs for the same to be swallowed vp in one danger or other; whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest repentance and the pardon thereof from the Lord, sealed vp vnto a mans conscience by his Spirit, great shall be his securitie and peace in all dangers, sweete his comforts in all distresses, with happie deliuerance from all euill, whether in life or in death.</p>
   <p>Now next after this heauenly peace with God and our owne consciences, we are carefully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for peace with all men what in vs lieth, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with our associates, and for that end watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes must be had, that we neither at all in our selues do giue, no nor easily take offence being giuen by others. Woe be vnto the world for offences, for though it be necessary (considering the malice of Satan and mans corruption) that offences come, yet woe vnto the man or woman either by whom
<pb facs="5"/>
the offence cometh, saith Christ, Math. 18.7. And if offences in the vnseasonable vse of things in them selues indifferent, be more to be feared then death it selfe, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 9.15. how much more in things simply euill, in which neither honour of God nor loue of man is thought worthy to be regarded.</p>
   <p>Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep our selues by the grace of God from giuing offence, except withall we be armed against the taking of them when they are giuen by others. For how vnperfect and lame is the worke of grace in that person, who wants charitie to couer a multitude of offences, as the Scriptures speake. Neither are you to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this grace onely vpon the common grounds of Christianitie, which are, that persons ready to take offence, either want charitie to couer offences, or wisedome duly to weigh humane frailtie; or lastly are grosse, though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teacheth, Math. 7.1, 2, 3. as indeed in mine owne experience, few or none haue beene found which sooner giue offence, then such as easily take it; neither haue they euer proued sound and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members in societies, which haue nourished in themselues that touchey humour. But besides these, there are diuers spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>iall motiues prouoking you aboue others to great care and conscience this way: As first, you are many of you strangers, as to the persons, so to the infirmities one of another, and so stand in neede of more watchfulnesse this way, lest when such things fall out in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as you suspected not, you be inordinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb facs="6"/>
with them; which doth require at your hands much wisedome and charitie for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and preuenting of incident offences that way. And last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y your intended course of ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie wil minister continuall occasion of offence, and will be as fuell for that fire, except you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently quench it with brotherly forbearance. And if taking of offence causlesly or easily at mens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be so carefully to be auoided, how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himselfe, which yet we certainly do so oft as we do murmure at his prouidence in our crosses, or beare impatiently such afflictions as wherewith he pleaseth to visit vs. Store we vp therefore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience against the euill day, without which we take offence at the Lord himselfe in his holy and iust works.</p>
   <p>A fourth thing there is carefully to be prouided for, to wit, that with your common emploiments you ioyne common affections truly bent vpon the generall good, auoiding as a deadly plague of your both common and speciall comfort all retirednesse of minde for proper aduantage, and all singularly affected any maner of way; let euery man represse in himselfe and the whole bodie in each person, as so many rebels against the common good, all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate respects of mens selues, not sorting with the generall conueniencie. And as men are carefull not to haue a new house shaken with any violence before it be well settled and the parts firmly knit: so be you, I beseech you brethren, much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the house of God which you are and are
<pb facs="6"/>
to be, be not shaken with vnnecessary nouelties or other oppositions at the first settling thereof.</p>
   <p>Lastly, whereas you are to become a body politik, vsing amongst your selues ciuill gouernment, and are not furnished with any persons of speciall emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie aboue the rest, to be chosen by you into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of gouernment: Let your wisedome and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse appeare, not onely in chusing such persons as do entirely loue, and will diligently promote the common good, but also in yeelding vnto them all due honour and obedience in their lawfull admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations; not beholding in them the ordinarinesse of their persons, but Gods ordinance for your good; nor being like vnto the foolish multitude, who more honour the gay coate, then either the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind of the man, or glorious ordinance of the Lord. But you know better things, and that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Lords power and authoritie which the Magistrate beareth, is honorable, in how meane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons soeuer. And this dutie you both may the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, because you are at least for the present to haue onely them for your ordinary gouernours, which your selues shall make choise of for that worke.</p>
   <p>Sundrie other things of importance I could put you in mind of, and of those before mentioned in more words, but I will not so far wrong your godly minds, as to thinke you heedlesse of these things, there being also diuers among you so well able to admonish both themselues and others of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth them. These few things therefore, and
<pb facs="7"/>
the same in few words I do earnestly commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your care and conscience, ioyning therewith my daily incessant prayers vnto the Lord, that he who hath made the heauens and the earth, the sea and all riuers of waters, and whose prouidence is ouer all his workes, especially ouer all his deare childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for good, would so guide and guard you in your wayes, as inwardly by his Spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for and with you, may haue after matter of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Name all the days of your and our liues. Fare you well in him in whom you trust, and in whom I rest</p>
