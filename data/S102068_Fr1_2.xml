   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, SIR FRANCIS BACON Knight, <hi>Lord Keeper of the great Seale</hi> of ENGLAND, and one of <hi>his Maiesties most honourable Priuy Counsell.</hi>

   <head type="sub">RIGHT HONOVRABLE:</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in the Church: euery one thinkes hee is in the Tower of Sion. Some that conceiue themselues to bee inspired with the rushing winde, would haue the Church, like that Spirit, to bee inuisible: Some are so pure, that they would haue it where it was first: Some imagine a Church to reside vpon their
<pb facs="3"/>wit: Some will haue it in any place, where there is no Roome; and some the greater or more bend all their wits to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to one Head in that Church, like the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Aristotles Primum,</hi> that must bee a Monarke by Power, not by Gifts, by Multitude, not by Truth; That must suppresse Schismes, and determine Faith. Their crie is great, <hi>The Roes and Hindes of the field</hi> doe stand agast vpon the opening of euery Romish hound,<note place="margin">Cant. 2 7.</note> The Consonants which speake for this onely Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as their superior Vowels bid them, and which cause men of tender consciences to make head they know not whither. Others, either of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or such as would haue an exact Religion in an Idaea, stand by and receiue none till all bee agreed. But if wee listen to the Canonists, as the Heathen made <hi>Terminus</hi> a God, and such a God that would not yeeld to <hi>Iupiter;</hi> so the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> must bee the end vnto which all diuisions in Religion, wheresoeuer discussed, must bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, from whom it is not lawfull to appeale to GOD.</p>
   <p>Many there are that follow him, wee may take vp a Fathers complaint, many which wee may flie, none which wee may follow; which flicker aloofe; and suffer him to flie with his wings of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authoritie, without a <hi>Quid iure posset, Quid charitate debet,</hi> and like an Eagle not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the world to flie alone. Emperours before were Lions; but now in the mysterie of <hi>Sampsons</hi> Riddle, mortified by Christ, are become Nursing
<pb facs="3"/>Fathers, and no Lions. The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were Nursing Fathers, now they are Lions, that range alone, that will brooke no equalitie, either with man, or with the world, or with the Scripture, or with any power, but God.</p>
   <p>So though God hath broken downe the wals of the old <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> like the bankes of Paradise, and hath let out the riuers of the Church to take their names from the Countreyes through which they passe, yet hee hath made inclosure againe, and will haue all to lose their name in him, as the great Sea.</p>
   <p>Thankes bee vnto God, that one of the other side of the banke was lately driuen ouer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Meribah</hi> and Separation, by the Spirit of God, as by a gentle gale of winde, and is now vnited vnto vs in a commerce of Religion, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante Roma, gaudente Ecclesia,</hi> The Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminating the name of ANTONIVS of SPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATO, as they did VICTORINVS of ROME,<note place="margin">Aug. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. <hi>8.2.</hi>
      </note> conuerted to publike profession by <hi>Simplicianus.</hi> In Saint BERNARDS time it was <hi>A voce toni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trui tui formidantes.</hi> The Pope spoke then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the voice of God, but now hee roares onely in a Bull, and wee hope ere long all EV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROPE will sit vpon him as a beast, when they shall see such great Masters of the flocke forsake him.</p>
   <p>The Author of this Treatise hath not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery obiected Scripture: Like Turkish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
<pb facs="4"/>no large Imagerie is drawne; but in foure knots hath folded all the colour which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the dependance vpon <hi>Rome.</hi> An obscure resemblance of him, yet his. <hi>Sed cuius haec ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go est?</hi> It is the <hi>Posthumus</hi> of Doctor FENTON, adorned with no other garments then he left it, not so properly his <hi>Image,</hi> but his <hi>Similitude,</hi> in which there are the true lineaments that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the proportion of his former workes, though not liu'd with those fresh colours, yet his without addition or correction. One there was it seemes of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> something a kinne to the borderers in the North, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death bit his booke of Vsurie <hi>by the heale,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 49.17</note> and drew his arguments as <hi>Cacus</hi> did the cattle of <hi>Hercules,</hi> backward, <hi>Ne qua forent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus vestigia rectis;</hi> whose impudencie was dasht before it had scarce looked abroad, by that watchfull and true Euangelicall Bishop the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan of <hi>London.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It may bee those that Gossip into other mens labours onely for newes, will dandle this a little in their hands, to see whether it bee like the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or no:<note place="margin">Nazianz. in pacie. <hi>2.</hi>

      <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

      </gap>, not to iudge, but to depraue it. And who will depraue that iudgement of his, which was admired of euery side; euen of those which in regard of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent gouernment, haue their opinions slipt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of ioynt? If there bee any, the naked innocencie without affectation, and the naturall
<pb facs="4"/>maiestie of the stile, like a Master Bee without a sting, will defend it. But as his booke against Vsurie had a Patron, so next to him not in <hi>desire</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> was to God, nor in <hi>conceit</hi> as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> nor in <hi>voice</hi> onely as <hi>Herod,</hi> but in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, and honour, and iudgement, is this poore modell dedicated.</p>
   <p>And now wee are sure, that since God hath <hi>separated your light from darknesse,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 1.4.</note> and drawne the Curtaine to discouer those secret excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies lodging within you, which because of some interpositions had not their full Epiphanie to the world, you will cleere his cause and ours, both concerning <hi>Maintenance</hi> and <hi>Countenance:</hi> Not being of those which haue broild the Clergie with disgraces and slaueries,<note place="margin">

      </note> as <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint GREGORIES sense, did burne the Temple, but keepe the gold; some alas, which haue kept Iustice, but loued it not, whose prosperitie, <hi>cùm arrisit, irrisit,</hi> made them fooles that thought vs no better, or else our pleas had neuer beene laught out of the Court with a <hi>plus facetiae quàm iustitiae,</hi>

But to your Honour, which did euer commiserate our humilitie, and releeue our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and reuerence our calling, and patronize our labours, doe I presume to present this booke,
<pb facs="5"/>which may be bold to offer praiers to God for your preseruation here, and your exaltation in the life of glory.</p>
