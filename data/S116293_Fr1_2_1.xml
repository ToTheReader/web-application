   <head type="sub">THE TRIAL OF WITCHCRAFT.</head>
   <p>Sir,—In "A Brief History of Witchcraft" (Taylor and Son, 1366) I find that in 1616 Dr. John Cotta, an eminent physician of Northampton; published a thoughtful work, decidedly in advance of his age, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled "The Trial of Witchcraft," and a foot-note gives the following:—"The Triall of Witch-craft, shewing the Trve and Righte Methode of the Discouery: with a Confutation of erroneous wayes. By John Cotta, Doctor in Physicke, London. Printed by George Pvr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowe for Samuel Rand, and are to be solde at his shop neere Holburne Bridge 1616 4 to." The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the title of the second edition:—'The Infallible Trve and Assvred VVitch: or the Second Edition, of the Tryall of Witch-craft. Shevving the Right and Trve Methode of the Discoverie: with a Confutation of Erroneovs Waies, carefvlly Reviewed and more fully Cleared and Augmented. By Iohn Cotta Doctor in Physicke, London: Printed for I.L. by R.H., and are to be solde at signe of the Grey-hound, in Pauls Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard 1625 4 to." I have a copy of this work which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the two title pages, which read as follows:—"The Triall of VVitch-craft, Shewing the Trve and Right Methode of the Discouery: with a Confutation of erroneous wayes. By Iohn Cotta Doctor in Physicke, London. Printed by I.L. for Richard Higgenbotham, and are to be sold at his shop at the signe of the Angel in Pauls Church-yard 1624." Second title page.—"The Infallible Trve and Assvrerd VVitch: or the Second Edition of the Tryall of Witch-craft, shevving the Right and Trve Methode of the Discoverie: with a Confvtation of Erroneovs VVaies, Carefvlly Reviewed and more fully cleared and Augmented. By Iohn Cotta, Doctor in Physicke. London, Printed by I.L. for Richard Higgenbotham and are to be sold at his shop at the signe of the Angel in Pauls Churchyard 1624." Were there two issues of "second edition" of this book in 1624 and 1625, or is the quotation in "The History of Witchcraft" incorrect?—Yours truly,</p>
