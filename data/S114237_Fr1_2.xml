      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING INTEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygence</hi> of a certayne worke done out of laten into English, by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father, the lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Chich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ster, at the request of a learned &amp; vertuous Ladye. And also vnderstanding of an other treatise touching the <hi>truth of Christ his naturall body,</hi> made by him, both of them secretly going among some good men, who were greatlye delighted with the reading of the same: We labored by al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meanes possible to obtayne the coppy of the sayd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke, as well for the sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="4 letters">
         <desc>••••</desc>
      </gap>r commendation that went of the exceliē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the matter as also for the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the person, who had trauailed therein, whose iudgement we know, to be such, as could make best choysy of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and learning so profound, as might most clearckly bewtify the same.</p>
   <p>And perusing the sayd worke exactly,
<pb facs="3"/>
as we found it both in substaunce &amp; also in handling, aunswerable to the reports geuen abroade thereof: so we thought it very meete, that the same should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the commodity of many, which now being shutte vp in certayne mens kéeping, did profyte but a few.</p>
   <p>In the said worke there is notably set forth, the maiestie, the power &amp; might of the eternall and euerlasting GOD, the whole discourse whereof séemeth to bee grounded vpon the words of S. Paule, in his Epistle to the Romaynes, the first Chapter.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>That the inuisible thinges of God are from the beginning of the world, knowen by the visible things made of God. his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting power also and diuinitie.</hi> So it conteineth very delightfull &amp; also much profytable matter to the Christian and Godly reader, in these dayes.</p>
   <p>The other treatise, intreating of the true presence of the most sacred, blessed and natural bodie of our sauiour Christ, is a Jewell so precieus, of so great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and value, with each true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb facs="3"/>
that we thincke al men will more desyre to reade the worke, then to heare the commendation thereof.</p>
   <p>Now touching the person, the fruites of whose study and paynes, we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes heretofore, and doe now also reape to our great comforte, we thought good both for truth sake, which euerye man is bound in cōscience to mayntein, &amp; also for confutation of such bad &amp; slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous spéeches, as by some lewde and euel disposed people are spred at tables, Alehouses, and such other odde places, agaynst so graue, wyse, learned, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a pastour, &amp; also to set downe such good vertues to the view of the world, as we of our assured and proper knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge haue experienced to be in him.</p>
   <p>And for that the glory of God is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and principally to be set forth, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of strange and irronious opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons, and by planting of true religion, through dilligēt preaching, and teaching of the word of god: F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>st ouer and besids his ordinary preaching vpon Sondayes and Holidayes, he hath gone thrée times
<pb facs="4"/>
through this whole Diocesse of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (which is almost fourescore myles in length) preaching himself at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test townes, and many learned Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers with him in other places: And this last Sommer was accepted of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, both of gentlemen preachers and people of the whole shire excéeding well, and in such sorte as the like hath not bene seene in the memory of man, to any of the calling in this countrey: Notwithstanding, that there wāted not some, though not many, which priuily both by fayre meanes &amp; foule, laboured the contrary.</p>
   <p>And whereas it was a rare thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, to heare a learned Sermō in Sussex, now the pulpittes in moste places sounde contynually with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> voyce of learned and Godly Preachers, he him selfe as <hi>Duxgregis,</hi> geuing good example vnto the rest in so graue &amp; learned man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the people with ardent zeale wonderfull reioycing, &amp; in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber take farre and long iorneyes, to bée pertakers of his good and godly lessons.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>We are assured, and the most irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and backwarde persones that are acquaynted with his proceedinges, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confesse (excepte they will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly speake agaynst their owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setences) that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ooting out of bad and vnlearned Curattes, and the planting of zealous and learned Preachers, hath bene occasion to him of great expenses &amp; charge: And so within these sixe yeres, he hath brought into this Diocesse, and preferred, or ben the meanes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of twenty Preachers, which be well able to preache in anye learned Audience in this realme: And by the dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent preaching and other excercisyng of himself, and these in the scriptures, hath trayned vp a. xl. more, in such sort, that they be sufficiente ynough to preach to any ordinary Audyence: and almoste euery minister by hearing of these and such trauayle in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they haue bene by the sayd pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and other his officers put vnto, be growne so rype in the Scriptures, that they can and doe, so painfully, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly▪
<pb facs="5"/>
and competently instructe the simple sorte in the principles of Religion, that euen children can now geue a better an accoumpt of the true fayth, thē in times past such as were reputed great clearks could haue done.</p>
   <p>But because it is not ynough to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the people of GOD holsome and godly doctrine, but also to confirme the same by example of good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, how well he hath trauayled in both the suppressinge of Macheuils, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, Libertines, Atheists, and suche other erronious persons, the mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of pore fatherlesse children against the oppressor, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

are a sufficient testimony.</p>
   <p>For the which good déedes (such is the malice of Sathan and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And surely we for our partes, haue oftentimes wondered at his constancie and pacience, that wheras we see others so ouercome with importunity of slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and infamous reportes, &amp; great enemies, when he heareth any lowde
