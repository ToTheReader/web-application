Though there are scarce any words of mine (howsoeuer they may perhaps seeme strange) which other writers in our language haue not formerly made familiar, and those few which are not altogether so (for the which also <hi>I</hi> haue more then once askt pardon in my Booke it selfe) I haue heere for thy vses, collected, and (by conference with the learned) so farre onely interpreted, as is necessary to vnderstand my meaning in the places where I vse them: for to interprete them at large and in all their senses were to take <hi>SCAPVLA'S,</hi> or <hi>THOMASIVS</hi> offices out of their hands. My care is chiefly to haue thee know mine.

      <label>APOSTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHE.</label>
      <item>An abrupt, or sodaine turning of our speech from one matter or person to another.

Such were not the <hi>Horti pensiles,</hi> or Hanging gardens of SEMIRAMIS, for they stood vpon pillars: Nor the ICARVS in OVID, or in SVETONIVS; for the one was but (as the fable of PHAETON) a picture of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ambition; the other the true story of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck fall of SIMON MAGVS the Sorcerer, vnder the name of ICARVS, at ROME: Nor MAHOMET'S yron coffin at MECCA: for that (as the fame, or fable is) it hangs in the Temple, by reason of certaine proportionable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of <hi>Load-stone</hi> which hold it vp by equall attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

The LATINS call it <hi>Indiuiduum,</hi> and LVCRETIVS <hi>semen rerum: Indiuiduum,</hi> because it was so little as it could not bee parted, or diuided, and <hi>semen rerum</hi> (seed of things) for that they were (according to the conceit of EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVRVS) the common mater of all things.</item>

         <p>And what shall wee say of reuiuing old and forgotten words? That cannot auoyd obscurity but will induce it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our helps being fewer to vnderstand them, then the GREEK, LATIN, or other famous languages: It is our sloath which suffers so many of our owne wordes to liue onely among the Arts, and Mysteries where they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, like DVTCH coynes which are not current out of their owne Citties, or Territories▪ Industry, and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would that wee should not borrow till our owne store were empty, or worne bare, which is to our selues vnknowne for want of obseruation.

figure, or image. Symbol (in my sense) is a figure, or shape which relateth to some cause, reason, qualitie, nature, or Historie, proper to this, or that Bearer, or family. To <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize,</hi> is <hi>so to beetoken, or</hi> so, and <hi>in that sort,</hi> to answer, or agree-with. Many frauds you shall read in PLAVTVS, plotted, and acted by counterfetting, and slie conueiance of these <hi>Symbols,</hi> or <hi>Tokens,</hi> wherein there was euer some image, or other. So the Symbol of AMPHITRVON in that <hi>Tragicomedie</hi> was, <hi>Sol cum quadrigis, The Sunne in his Chariot drawne with foure horse,</hi> PYRGOPOLINICES, the bragging Soldier, had his owne louely selfe with great <hi>Decorum,</hi> drawne in his Signet for a Symbol. <hi>Symbolical Philosophie</hi> therefore is that kinde of learning, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which knowing the causes, and proprieties of of things naturall, and supernaturall, doth teach how to make, or to expound those mystical, and artificial bodies, called <hi>Symbols,</hi> of what kinde soeuer.</item>
