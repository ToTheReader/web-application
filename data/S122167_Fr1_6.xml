   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Alomon the peaceable Prince of Israell, as we read in the thirde of Kynges, after he had finished the buildyng of the Lordes Temple (which he had vij. yeares in hand) made his petition to the Lord for all that should pray in the sayde Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or turne theyr face toward it. And his request was graūted, the Lord aunswering him, as we read in the sayd booke. cap. 6. <hi>I haue heard</hi> (sayth he) <hi>thy prayer and haue sanctified this place. &amp;c.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the infinite Maiesty of God is not to be compassed in any materiall walles, yet it so pleased his goodnesse to respect this praier of the king, that not only he promised to heare thē which there prayed, but also replenished the same with his own glory. For so we read again in the book aforesayd: <hi>Et non poterant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strare propter nebulā, quia repleuit gloria domini, domū domini. 3. Re. 7.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Vpon like trust in Gods gracious goodnes, if I sinnefull wretch, not comparing with the building of that Temple, but folowing the zeale of the builder might either be so bold to aske, or so happye to speed, after my vij. yeares trauayle about this Ecclesiasticall History, most humbly would craue of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to bestow his blessing vpon the same, that as the prayers of them, which prayed in the outward Temple were heard: so all true disposed mindes which shall resort to the reading of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Hystory conteining the Actes of Gods holy Martyrs, and monumentes of his Church, may by example of theyr lyfe, fayth, &amp; doctrine, receiue some such spirituall fruit to theyr soules through the operation of his grace, that it may be to the aduauncement of his Glory, and profite of his Churche, through Christ Iesus our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But as it happened in that Temple of Salomon, that all which came thither, came not to pray, but many to prate, some to gaze and see newes, other to talke and walke, some to buy and sell, some to carpe and finde fault, and finally some also at the last to destroy and plucke down, as they did in deed. For what is in this world so strong, but it will be impugned? what so perfect, but it will be abused? so true, that will not be contraryed? or so circumspectly done, wherein wrangling <hi>Theon</hi> will not set in his tooth? Euen so neither do I looke for any other in this present Hystory: but that amongest many well disposed Readers, some Waspes nest or other will be styrred vp to busze about mine eares. Such a daungerous thing it is now a dayes to write or do any good, but either by flattering a man must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Godly, or by true speaking procure hatred with the wicked. Of such stinging Waspes and buszing Drones I had sufficient triall in my former edition before, who if they had found in my book any iust cause to carpe, or vpon any true zeale of truth had proceded agaynst the vntruths of my story and had brought iust proofes for the same, I could haue right well abide it. For God forbid, but that faultes, wheresoeuer they be, should be detected and accused. And therfore Accusers in a Common wealth after my mind do serue to no small stead.</p>
   <p>But then such Accusers must beware they play not the dog, of whom Cicero in his Oration spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which being set in <hi>Capitolio</hi> to fray away Theeues by night, left the Theeues and fell to barcke at true men walking in the day. Where true faultes be, there to bay &amp; barcke is not amisse. But to carpe where no cause is, to spye in other strawes, and to leape ouer theyr owne blockes: to swalow Camels, and to strayne gnattes: to oppresse truth with lyes, and to set vp lyes for truth, to blaspheme the deare Martyrs of Christ and to Canonize for Sayntes, whom Scripture would scarce allow for good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, that is intollerable. Such barcking Curres, if they were well serued, would be made a whyle to stoope. But with these brauling spirites I entend not at this time much to wrastle.</p>
   <p>Wherefore to leaue them a while, till further leasure serue me to attend vpon them, thus much I thought in the meane season, by way of Protestation or petition, to write vnto you both in generall &amp; particular the true members and faythful Congregation of Christes Church, wheresoeuer either cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated together, or dispersed through the whole Realme of England, that forsomuch as all the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of these Aduersaryes is to do what they can, by discrediting of this History with slaunders &amp; si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister surmises, how to withdraw the Readers frō it: This therfore shalbe in few wordes to premonish and desire of all and singuler of you (all well minded louers and partakers of Christes Gospell) not to suffer your selues to be deceiued with the big brags, and hyperbolicall speeches of those flaundering tongues, whatsoeuer they haue or shall hereafter exclame agaynst the same. But indifferently staying your iudgement till truth be tryed, you will first peruse, &amp; then refuse measuring the vntruthes of this Hystory, not by the scoaring vp of theyr hundreds and thousandes of lyes which they geue out, but wisely weying the purpose of theyr doinges, according as you finde, and so to iudge of the matter.</p>
   <p>To read my bookes I allure neither one nor other. Euery man as he seeth cause to like as he list. If
<pb facs="17"/>
any shall thinke his labor to much in reading this history, his choyce is free either to read this, or any other which he more mindeth. But if the fruite thereof shall recompence the Readers trauell, then would I wish no man so light eared, to be caryed away for any sinister clamour of Aduersaryes, who many times depraue good doinges, not for the faultes they finde, but therefore finde faultes because they would depraue. As for me and my history, as my will was to profite all and displease none: so if skill in any part wanted to will, yet hath my purpose bene simple, and certes the cause no lesse vrgent also, which moued me to take this enterprise in hand.</p>

         </gap>g of storie writers.</note>For first to see the simple flocke of Christ, especially the vnlearned sort, so miserably abused, and all for ignoraunce of history, not knowing the course of times, and true discent of the Church, it pittyed me, that part of diligence so long to haue bene vnsupplyed in this my countrey Church of Englande. Agayne considering the multitude of Chronicles and story writers, both in England, and out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, of whome the most part haue bene either Monkes or Clientes to the sea of Rome, it grieued me to behold how partially they handled theyr storyes. Whose paynefull trauell albeit I cannot but cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, in committing diuers thinges to writing, not vnfruitful to be knowne, or vnpleasant to be read: yet it lamented me to see in theyr Monumentes the principall poyntes, which chiefly concerned the state of Christes Church, and were most necessary of all christen people to be knowne, either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretermitted, or if any mention thereof were inserted, yet were all things drawn to the honor spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Church of Rome, or els to the fauor of theyr owne sect of Religion. Wherby the vulgare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ort, hearing and reading in theyr writinges no other church mentioned or magnified but onely that Church which here florished in this world in riches and iollity, were drawne also to the same persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to thinke no other Church to haue stand in all the earth, but onely the Church of Rome.</p>
   <p>In the number of this sort of writers, besides our Monkes of England (for euery Monastery almost had his Chronicler) I might also recite both Italian, and other countrey authors, as <hi>Platina, Sabellicus, Nauclerus, Martinus, Antoninus, Vincētius, Onuphrius, Laziardus, Georgius Lilius, Pollid▪ Virgilius,</hi> with many more, who taking vpon thē to intermeddle with matters of the church, although in part they expresse some truth in matters concerning the Bishops and sea of Rome: yet in suppressing an other part, they play with vs, as Ananias and Saphira did with their mony, or as Apelles did in Pliny, who painting the one halfe of Venus comming out of the sea, left the other halfe vnperfect. So these writers while they shew vs one half of the B. of Rome, the other halfe of him they leaue vnperfect, &amp; vtterly vntold. For as they paynt him out on the one part glistering in welth and glorye, in shewing what succession the Popes had from the chaire of S. Peter, when they first began, and how long they sate, what Churches and what famous buildings they erected, how farre theyr possessions reached, what lawes they made, what councels they called, what honour they receiued of Kynges and Emperours, what Princes and Countryes they brought vnder theyr authority, with other like stratagemes, of great pompe and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: so on the other side what vices these Popes brought with them to theyr seat, what abhominatiōs they practised, what superstition they mainteined, what Idolatry they procured, what wicked doctrine they defended contrary to the expresse word of God, to what heresies they fell, into what diuision of sectes they cut the vnity of christian Religion, how some practised by Simony, some by Necromancy and Sorcery, some by poysoning, some indenting with the Deuill to come by theyr Papacy, what hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy was in theyr liues, what corruptiō in theyr doctrine, what warres they raysed, what bloudshed they caused, what treachery they trauersed agaynst their Lordes and Emperours, imprisoning some, betraying some to the Templaryes and Saracēs, in bringing other vnder theyr feet, also in beheading some, as they did with <hi>Fredericus</hi> and <hi>Conradinus,</hi> the heires and ofspring of the house of <hi>Fredericus Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barossa.</hi> an. 1269. furthermore how mightely almighty God hath stand agaynst them, how their warres neuer prospered agaynst the Turke, how the iudgementes of the godly learned frō time to time haue euer repugned agaynst theyr errours▪ &amp;c. of these and a thousand other mo, not one word hath bene touched, but all kept as vnder <hi>Benedicite</hi> in Auriculer confession.</p>
   <p>This partiall dealing and corrupt handling of Historyes, when I considered, I thought with my self nothing more lacking in the church, then a ful &amp; a complet history, which being faythfully colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of all our Monastical writers &amp; writtē Monuments, should conteine neither euery vain writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fable for that would be to much, nor yet leaue out any thing necessary, for that would be to little: but with a moderate discretion taking the best of euery one, should both ease the labor of the reader from turning ouer such a number of writers: and also should open the plaine truth of times lying long hid in obscure darcknes of antiquity. Wherby all studious Readers, beholding as in a glasse the state, course, and alteration of Religion, decay of doctrine, and the controuersies of the church, might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the better betwene antiquity and nouelty. For if the things which be first (after the rule of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian) are to be preferred before those that be latter, then is the reading of histories much necessary in the church, to know what went before, and what folowed after. And therfore not without cause <hi>Historia,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Primum quod{que} ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap>mum est Tertul.</note>
      <hi>in old authors is called the witnesse of times, the light of verity, the life of memory, teacher of life, &amp; she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of antiquitie. &amp;c.</hi> Without the knowledge wherof mans life is blind, and soone may fall into any kind of errour, as by manifest experience we haue to see, in these desolate latter times of the Church, when as the Byshops of Rome vnder colour of antiquity haue turned truth into heresy and brought such new found deuises of straunge doctrine and Religiō as in the former age of the church were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of before, and all through the ignorance of times, and for lacke of true history.</p>
   <p>For to say the truth, if times had bene well searched, or if they which wrote Hystories had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality gone vpright betwene God and Baall, halting on neither side, it might well haue bene foūd the most part of all this catholicke corruptiō intruded into the church by the bishops of Rome,
<pb facs="18"/>
as Transubstantiation, leuation, and adoration of the sacrament, auriculer confession, forced vowes of Priestes not to mary, veneration of Images, priuate and satisfactory Masses, the order of Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Masse now vsed, the vsurped authoritie, &amp; <hi>Summa potestas</hi> of the sea of Rome, with all the route of their ceremonies and wiedes of superstition ouergrowing nowe the Churche, all these (I say) to bee new nothinges lately coyned in the minte of Rome without any stampe of antiquitie, as by readyng of this present history shall sufficiently, I trust, appeare. Whiche history therefore I haue here taken in hand, that as other story writers heretofore haue employed their trauayle to magnifie the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">Image of both Churches.</note> so in this history might appeare to all Christian readers the Image of both Churches, as well of the one as of the other: especially of the poore oppressed and persecuted Churche of Christ. Which persecuted Church though it hath bene of long season troden vnder foote by enemyes, neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected in the world, nor regarded in histories, and almost scarse visible or knowne to worldly eyes, yet hath it bene the true Church only of God, wherin he hath mightely wrought hetherto in preseruing the same in all extreeme distresses, continually stirring vp frō time to tyme faythful ministers, by whō alwayes hath bene kept some sparkes of hys true doctrine and Religion.</p>
   <p>Now for asmuch as the true Church of God goeth not lightly alone,<note place="margin">The descent of Christs Church from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> but is accompanyed wyth some other Church or Chappel of the deuill to deface and maligne the same, necessary it is therfore the difference betweene them to be sene, and the descent of the right Churche to be described from the Apostles tyme. Which hetherto in most part of histories hath bene lacking, partly for feare, that men durst not: partly for ignoraunce that men could not discerne rightly betweene the one and the other. Who beholding the Church of Rome to be so visible and glorious in the eyes of the worlde, so shining in outward beauty, to beare suche a porte, to cary suche a trayne and multitude, and to stand in such hye authoritie, upposed the same to be only the right Catholike mother. The other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not so visibly known in the world, they thought therfore it could not be the true church of Christ. Wherin they were far deceaued. For although the right church of God be not so inuisible in the world, that none can see it, yet neyther is it so visible agayne that euery worldly eye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. For like as is the nature of truth▪ so is the proper condition of the true Churche, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly none seeth it,<note place="margin">How the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Church of Christ is visible and not visible▪</note> but such onely, as be the members and partakers thereof. And therefore they which require that Gods holy Church should be euident and visible to the whole world seeme to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fine the great sinagogue of the world rather then the true spirituall Church of God.</p>
   <p>In Christes time who would haue thought, but the congregations and Councelles of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies had ben the right church: and yet had Christ an other Church in earth besides that, which albeit it was not so manifest in the sight of the world, yet was it the onely true Church in the sight of God. Of this Church ment Christ speaking of the Temple, whiche he woulde rayse agayne the thyrd day. And yet after that the Lord was risen, he shewed not himselfe to the worlde, but onely to his electe which were but few. The same Churche after that encreased and multiplied mightely amonge the Iewes, yet had not the Iewes eyes to see Gods Churche, but did persecute it till at length all their whole nation was destroyed.</p>
   <p>After the Iewes, then came the heathen Emperours of Rome, who hauing the whole power of the world in their hands, did what the world could do, to extinguish the name and church of christ. Whose violence cōtinued the space of 3. hundreth yeares. All which while the true church of christ was not greatly in sight of the world, but rather was abhorred euery where, and yet notwithstanding the same small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>elly flocke so despised in the worlde, the Lorde highly regarded and mightely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. For although many then of the Christians did suffer death: yet was their death neither losse to them, nor detriment to the Church: but the more they suffered, the more of theyr bloud encreased.</p>
   <p>In the time of these Emperours, God raysed vp then in this Realme of Britaine diuers worthy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and witnesses, as <hi>Elnanus, meduinus, Meltiuianus, Amphibolus, Albanus, Aaron, Iulius</hi> and other moe In whose time the doctrine of fayth without mens traditions was sincerely preached. After theyr death and Martyrdom, it pleased the Lord to prouide a generall quietnes to his Church, wherby the number of hys flocke began more to encrease.</p>
   <p>In this age then followed here in the sayd land of Britayne <hi>Fastidius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">The antiquitye of the Churche here in England with the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the same.</note>
      <hi>Niuianus, Patricius, Bacchiarius, Dubricius, Congellus, Kentigernus, Helmotus, Dauid, Daniell, Sampson, Elnodugue, Asaphus, Cildas, Heulanus Elbodus, Dinothus, Samuell, Niuius,</hi> and a great sort moe, whiche gouerned the Churche of Britayne by Christen doctrine a long season, albeit the ciuil gouernours for the tyme, were then dissolute &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, as Gildas very sharply doth lay to theyr charge, and so at length were subdued by the Saxons.</p>
   <p>All this while about the space of foure hundred yeares, Religion remayned in Britayne vncorrupt and the word of Christ truely preached, till about the comming of Austen and of hys companions from Rome, many of the sayd Britayne preachers were slayne by the Saxons. After that began Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten fayth to enter &amp; spring among the Saxons, after a certayne romish sort, yet notwithstanding some what more tollerable, thē were the times, which after folowed, through the dilligent industry of some godly teachers, which then liued amongest them: as <hi>Aidanus, Finianus, Coleman</hi> Archbishop of Yorke <hi>Beda, Iohn of Beuerlay, Alcuinus, Noetus, Hucharius, Serlo, Achardus, Ealredus, Alexander Neckam, Negellus, Fenallus, Alfricus, Sygeferthus</hi> &amp; such other: who though they erred in some few thinges, yet neither so grossely,<note place="margin">Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued for a publicke doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> nor so greatly to be complayned of in respect of the abuses that followed. For as yet, all thys while, the error of Transubstantiation and leuation, with auriculer confession was not crept in for a publicke doctrine in Christes Church, as by theyr owne Saxon Sermon, made by <hi>Aelfricus,</hi> &amp; set out in the second Volume of this present history may appeare pag. 1114. During the which meane time although the Bishops of Rome wer had here in some reuerēce with the Clergy: yet had they nothing
<pb facs="19"/>
as yet to do in setting lawes touching matters of the Church of England: but that only appertayned to the kings and gouernours of the land as is in this story to be seene. pag. 754.</p>

Out of this corruption sprang forth here in Englād (as did in other places more) an other romish kind of Monkery, worse then the other before, being much more drowned in superstition and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, which was about the yeare of our Lord. 980. Of this swarme was <hi>Egbertus Aigelbert▪ Egwine, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface, Wilfrede Agathon, Iames, Romayne, Cedda, Dunstane, Oswold, Athelwold, Athelwine</hi> Duke of <hi>Eastan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, Lanfrancke, Anselme</hi> and such other.</p>
   <p>And yet in this tyme also through Gods prouidence, the Churche lacked not some of better knowledge and iudgement, to weigh with the darcknes of those dayes. For although king Edgar, with Edward his base sonne being seduced by Dunstane, Oswold and other Monkish Clerkes, was thē a great author and fautor of much superstition, erecting as many Monasteries, as were Sondayes in the yeare: yet notwithstanding this continued not long. For eftsoones after the death of Edgar came king Ethelrede and Queene Elfthred his mother, with Alferus Duke of merceland, and other peeres and nobles of the Realme, who displaced the Monkes againe, and restored the maryed Priests to their old possessions and liuings. Moreouer after that followed also the Danes whiche ouerthrew those Monkish foundations, as fast as king Edgar had set them vp before.</p>
   <p>And thus hetherto stode the condition of the true Church of Christ, albeit not without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance and difficultie, yet in some meane state of the truth &amp; veritie, till time of pope Hildebrand called Gregory 7. which was nere about the yeare. 1080. And of Pope Innocentius 3. in the yeare 1215. By whome altogether was turned vpside downe, all order broken, dissipline dissolued, true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine defaced. Christian faith extinguished. Instead whereof was set vp preaching of mens decrees dreames, and idle traditions. And whereas before truth was free to be disputed amongest learned men, now libertie was turned into law, Argument into Authoritie. Whatsoeuer the Byshoppe of Rome denounced, that stode for an oracle, of all men to be receaued without opposition or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: whatsoeuer was contrary, <hi>ibso facto</hi> it was heresie, to be punished with fagot and flaming fire. Then began the sincere fayth of this English Church,<note place="margin">The true Church when it began first to decay.</note> which held out so long, to quayle. Then was the clerre sunne shine of Gods word ouershadowed, with mistes and darcknes, appearing like sacke-cloth to the people, which neither could vnderstand that they read, nor yet permitted to read that they could vnderstand. In these miserable dayes, as the true visible Church beganne now to shrinke and keep in for feare: so vpstart a new sort of players to furnish the stage, as schole Doctours, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, and foure orders of Friers. Besides other Monasticall sectes and fraternities of infinite variety. Which euer since haue kept such a stirre in the Church, that none for them almost durst rout, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caesar, king, nor subiect. What they defined, stode. What they approued, was Catholicke: What they condemned, was heresie: whom soeuer they accused, none almost could saue. And thus haue these hetherto continued or raigned rather in the Church, the space now of foure hundreth yeares and odde. During which space, the true Church of Christ, although it durst not openly appeare in the face of the world, oppressed by tyranny: yet neyther was it so inuisible or vnknown: but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence of the Lord, some remnaunt alwayes remayned from tyme to time, which not onely shewed secret good affection to sincere doctrine, but also stode in open defence of truth agaynst the disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Churche of Rome.</p>

   <p>I do but recite the principall writers and preachers in those dayes: Howe many thousandes there were which neuer bowed their knees to Baall, that is knowne to God alone. Of whome wee finde in the writings of one <note place="margin">Ex Brushio. Ex Christiano Masseo.</note>
      <hi>Brushius</hi> that xxxvi. Citizens of Maguntia were burned, an. 1390. Who follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the doctrine of the Waldenses, affirmed the Pope to be the great Antichrist.

   <p>Wherfore if any be so farre beguiled in his opinion to thinke the doctrine of the church of Rome (as it now standeth) to be of such antiquitie, &amp; that the same was neuer impugned before the time of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> now of late, let him read these histories: or if he thinke the sayd historie not to be of sufficient credite to alter his perswasion let him peruse the Actes and Statutes of Parliamentes, passed in this realme of auncient time and therein consider and conferre the course of times; where he may finde and read.<note place="margin">Statut. in An. 5.

   <p>Furthermore he shall finde likewise in <hi>Statut. An. 2. Henr. 4.

   <p>What shall neede then any more witnes to proue this matter, when you see so many yeares agoe, whole armyes and multitudes, thus standing agaynst the Pope? who thoughe they bee termed here for heretickes and schismatickes, yet in that, which they call heresie, serued they the liuing Lord, within the Arke of his true spirituall and visible Churche.</p>
   <p>And where is then the friuolous bragge of the Papistes, which make so muche of there paynted sheath, &amp; would nedes beare vs downe, that this gournment of the Church of Rome which nowis, hath bene of such an old standing, time out of minde, euen from the primitiue Antiquitie, &amp; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any other church demonstrable here in earth for men to follow, besides the said only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mother church of Rome? whē as we haue sufficiently proued before by the continual descēt of the
<pb facs="21"/>
Church till this present tyme, that the sayd Church, after the doctrine which is now reformed, is no new begunne matter, but euen the olde continued Churche, by the prouidence and promise of Christ, still standing, which albeit it hath bene of late yeares repressed by the tyranny of Romayne Byshops, more then before: yet notwithstanding it was neuer so oppressed but God hath euer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in it the truth of his Gospell, agaynst heresies and errours of the Church of Rome, as in thys history more at full is to be seene.</p>

By the which tokens almighty God (no doubt) presignified what grieuous afflictions and bloudy persecutions shoulde then begin to ensue vppon his Churche for hys Gospels sake, according as in this history is described, wherein is to be seene what Christen bloud hathe bene spilt, what persecutions raysed, what tyranny exercised, what tormentes deuised, what trechery vsed agaynst the poore flocke and Church of Christ, in such sort as since Christes tyme greater hath not bene seene.</p>
