      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y attempt may seeme a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but where <hi>IVDGEMENT</hi> searcheth out the cause, and Prudence guideth Wisdome to weigh the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, the conceit of wondermēt ceaseth. What hath induced mee to ioyne you with your Honourable
<pb facs="3"/>
Lord, needs no long relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God hath cemented and combined you together with the neerest &amp; strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bands, and therefore I in my due honoring of both, presume to conioyne you both in this one Dedication.</p>
   <p>What is conceiued and reported of your Honours worth, thorow all our Countrey, I must passe ouer in silence, for well I know your excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie will not suffer such (though deserued) a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Your Honour rather affecting to doe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing Fame, than Fame it selfe: And like the fixed starres, the higher God hath set you, the lesse you desire to seeme.</p>
   <p>I confesse I am (as yet) but a Stranger in these parts, yet must he be more strange that meeteth not with the report of your Honours vertues: whose diligent paines in gaining knowledge of holy things, and conscionable practise of what you know: whose
<pb facs="3"/>
humble, sober, wise, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and modest cariage (rare vertues to be found in Ladies of so high a place and ranke) are so many tongues, and mouthes, and pens, without mine, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish your due praises.</p>
   <p>And though through the corruption of these times, this age is growne so base, as that one cannot thinke any to be the better or the worse for the report that flies of them, vnlesse they be eye-witnesses either of their good or ill; yet where the sound is all so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I dare be confident of an holy inclination, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious disposition; which hath giuen me such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as that I haue little need to misdoubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Honours accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Treatise, or to aduise your vse: for I perswade my selfe that you wil not only view the title and Epistle (as the fashion of most Patrons is) but the whole book also in some of those houres which your
<pb facs="4"/>
Honour redeemes (I dare say) for soule employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from those idle and excessiue customes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in too many Ladies please themselues and none else.</p>
   <p>But I know that your Honor will be better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if I turne praises into praiers: therefore I will endeuour to supply that want, this way; beseeching the God of Maiestie and mercy, to sanctifie your heart, yet more and more; who with the New-yeere giue you new supplies of the graces of his Spirit, and gratiously to encrease in you the ground of all true Honor, <hi>Goodnesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let me not offend in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering so meane a worke to so worthy a Personage: the weaker it is, the more need hath it of a worthy Patron, therefore</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I humbly betake it to your Honours fouourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: And so your Honour to the protection of the Highest.</hi>
