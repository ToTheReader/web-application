   <head>¶An Admonition to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not gentle Reader, but that the description of this present historie wil make thée to wonder, as well bicause of the varietie of things that herein then mayst Reade, as also of many others whiche at the firste wil seme vnto thée rather monstrous than naturall. But after that thou hast soberly wayed &amp; considered the great effects of our mother dame nature, I doe surely beleue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> such admiratiōs shal haue no more place in thée. Also let it not seme to thée strāge the setting forth of many strāge trées, as Palme trées and others, with beasts of the fielde and foules of the Ayre, the which are cleane contrarie to the setting forth of our Cosmographers and Anciente writers, who for bicause that they haue not sene the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and for the smal experience and knowledge that they had, did greatly erre. But if thou herein stande in doubt, then those that haue trauelled thether, and those <hi>Indians</hi> that were brought frō thence, can affirme al things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contayned to be true. Furthermore if that there be here in this booke any wordes that seme to thée rude or il placed, thou shalt therefore accuse the feuer and death, (y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feuer) which hath so kept or cleaned to the Author since his returne home, that he had no leasure to peruse his boke before that it came to the Printer, being prouoked to deliuer it at the commaundement of the Cardinall of <hi>Sens:</hi> and death which happened to <hi>Ambrose de la porte,</hi> a good student and well sene in the Frenche tong, who had taken vpō him the whole charge of this present boke. Notwithstanding gentle Readers, our good will herein hath not bene wanting, onely wishing for recompence, that it may be agreable to thée. Farewell.</p>
