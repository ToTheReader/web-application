   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ICHAEAS</hi> (a learned Iewish Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine) by his diligent comparing of the Prophecies of the Old Testament, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching IESVS CHRIST, with the exact accomplishment of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the New Testament; forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his former Iudaisme, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Christian Religion. But in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing diuers differences touching faith among Christians (and particularly among the Catholiks and Protestants) knoweth not to whether side to range himselfe. At this tyme it so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that there is a generall meeting of many famous lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men of all Religions, in the greate Citty of <hi>Cosmopolis</hi> in <hi>Vtopia:</hi> among whom <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne,</hi> and <hi>Doctour Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> are thither comne. <hi>Michaeas</hi> hastneth thither, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the said <hi>Cardinall</hi> and <hi>Doctour</hi> his present state, &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to them his vncertainty, whether to embrace the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth, or Protestancy. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the <hi>Doctour</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Principles of each others religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to him different meanes of setling his iudgement in poynts of fayth. <hi>Michaeas</hi> (for some peculiar reasons) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth both their directions; He reduceth the tryall of all to this one head: to wit, that whereas he fyndeth in the New <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. &amp; 15. &amp; 16. Act. 28.</note> Testament, that the true fayth was once planted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in Rome; He saith, that if it can be proued, that this fayth euer altered since the Apostles tymes, he will become a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
<pb facs="3"/>
if not, he meaneth to be a Roman Catholike. Hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he earnestly entreateth the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the <hi>Doctour,</hi> that they would enter into dispute, touching the change of fayth in the Church of Rome. They both accord to his request, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly begin a serious &amp; graue discourse touching this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> so presseth <hi>Doctour Whitakers</hi> with weight of arguments, &amp; by discouering the weaknes of the <hi>Doctours</hi> answeres and Obiections, as that in the end the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour</hi> (entring into greate intemperance of words, against the Church of Rome) abruptly breaketh off his discourse, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly departeth. <hi>Michaeas,</hi> as conuinced with the force of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> disputation, is resolued to become a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; and so accordingly receaueth in the end in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church of <hi>Cosmopolis,</hi> his Baptisme, by the hands of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> by whom also in some short tyme after, he is made Priest. Thus far concerning the fiction of this first Dialogue.</p>
