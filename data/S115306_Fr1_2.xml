      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, ever since my childish yeares were adopted with that mutuall sense of seeing, and imboldned with your favourable smiles; I presumed to survey the manifold favours, that I found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Margent of your love: which seeing, I finde my selfe so deepely indebted to your Worship, that although I should endeavour my selfe, even to the last gaspe, yet were it impossible for me to deserve, or make you restitution for the least of them: but as heretofore I still presumed on your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, presenting to your Worship the frownes of fortune, so rudely and roughly polished, that I feare you will smile with <hi>Alexander</hi> at the crooked deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Vulcan:</hi> yet sometimes the mind is as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to heare of <hi>Pans,</hi> homely fancies, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned labours; <hi>Homer</hi> wrote verses as well on <hi>Irus</hi> the Beggar, as <hi>Eurymachus</hi> the wooer: <hi>Apollo</hi> gives O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as well to the poore for his mite, as the rich for
<pb facs="3"/>
his treasure: <hi>Darius</hi> aswell received the rough unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd colors of <hi>Mison,</hi> as the curious pictures of <hi>Apelles,</hi> Therefore I beseech you, to shroud this imperfect Pamphlet, vnder your worships patronage: assuring my selfe that your worships learned education, &amp; vertuous disposition, will be a sufficient defence to protect me from the enuious tongues of the scorning Sycophants, and hoping as <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his Sonne, vouchsafed to lye in <hi>Philemons</hi> poore cottage: so I hope your worship will excuse my slender skill, &amp; accept of my willing mind, and when you haue giuen them a fauorable view, with <hi>Minerua</hi> vnder your golden Target couer a deformed Owle: so hoping for more then yet I haue deserued, I rest, wishing you the happie successe of hearts content, where I leaue you to the Heavens disposing.</p>
