   <head>¶ <hi>TO THE RJGHT</hi> honorable Sir <hi>Frauncis</hi> WALSINGHAM Knight, of <hi>her Maiesties most honorable priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> and principall Secretorie to <hi>her Highnes,</hi> ANTHONY ANDERSON <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> of Christs holie Gospell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth increase in Christ our Lord, and much honour by him multiplyed.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough (Right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) it seeme much better to heare, yea, euen to the best learned, rather thē to write of suche argument, as by rugged enemies hardly can bee wel digested, whose sharpened toongs inable to further hurte, as burning coales doe seeke to scorch the godly: yet considering that in so honorable a place I had pronounced the Sermon following, and by so manye earnest and godlye persons eftsoones desired
<pb facs="3"/> to penne the same, I rather consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at last, to abide a presente brunt, (sheltered vnder mightie protection) and to discouer in part the Popish ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, for the benefit of many: then cowardly for feare of some Romish storme, to thrust so bright a cādle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a darkening bushell. And bethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as conueniency asketh) on whō to craue a second shield for this my so spent time, your Honour first came vnto minde: to whose goodnes I am not smally bounde, for that benefite, which earst by your honourable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I did attaine. In regarde whereof, though farre vnable to render satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or approching measure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, I rest, not debarred of former purpose, to present such short pay, in parte of aunswere to further debt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured the rather by the well knowne godlinesse in your lowly brest, which can and doe content your selfe many times with a Mite, from a well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Widowe, though muche store of treasure cannot ballaunce your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. My will is much, but my wealth
<pb facs="3"/> is small, yet sometimes small pearles for their purenes, are accoūted worth some greater stones of more glorious shewe. A twofolde suite to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I haue for this, to say: that your wisedome woulde not onely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye your good liking of this my bold enterprise, but also to vouchsafe your godlye ayde against such <hi>Romish Riots,</hi> as may percase conspire by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulte, against this simple truth. For though their shows be not all vnseem lie, yet their deedes do approue those of them which that way be absolute, to bee in this most horrible murther and sacrylege, by such <hi>Sauage Treason,</hi> more then <hi>Resolute.</hi> And therefore ought to bee censured with <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophets sentence.<note place="margin">Esay. 26.10.</note>
      <hi>Shewe mercie to the wicked, yet he will not learne righteousnes, but in the lande of vprightnes hee will doe wickedly, and will not consider the great &amp; mightie hand of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And of whose craftines to deceiue, we may not (God graunt that we bee not) by ouer-seeing them (not with insight necessary) be drawne secure of
<pb facs="4"/> our safetie,<note place="margin">Iosu. 23.13.</note> while they harbour in our bosomes. For <hi>Salomon</hi> doth sommon our suruey of suche with sharpe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 26.24.25.</note> saying: <hi>He that hateth, will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite with his lippes, but in his heart hee layeth vp deceite. Though he speake fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably beleeue him not, for he beareth seuen abhominations in his heart.</hi> But yet heere is comfort: <hi>Hatred maye bee coueredly deceite: but the</hi> Malice thereof <hi>shall bee discouered in the congregation.</hi> No better witnes can be of Gods truth for this, amongst so many honourable Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, then your Honor, as to whom (for the discouerie of the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling hate in the <hi>Catholike Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>) (bent against the sacred state and person of the Lordes annointed, our Soueraigne <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) the Lorde from aboue hath allotted you the height of such honour, and the paine of this <hi>Pleasure,</hi> to sound the depth, &amp; by seasonable search surely to finde out, aswell the chiefe of the deepest dooers in this their most bloudy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: as wisely to weigh vp the huge bulke, and holde <hi>Ancker</hi> of all their
<pb facs="4"/> traiterous Conspiracies. And as our heartes are inflamed with heapes of praises vnto God for this (as many as fear the Lord, &amp; loue their own safety) so were it impossible to suppose, that such faithfull Subiectes, could bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained frō continuall praier to God, in our <hi>sole mediatour Christ,</hi> for the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie increase of godly wisedome, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous honour, and heauenly felicity, to the borde and bodies of such seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Senators,</hi> whose Honours deepely regarding the daungers imminent, brought in this perillous storme, so wisely by diuine Councell, laide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent hande vppon the helme of our stately shippe, as by the still and most sweete pirre of coelestiall windes,<note place="margin">Eccle. 10.20.</note> shee speedilie (but miraculously) cut tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the <hi>Roaming loftie Seas,</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies crossing, in suppose to sound and sinke the same. But by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly prouidence (in these honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mariners diligence) our shippe of state, with her <hi>owner of high Maiesty,</hi> yea &amp; her whole fraught of <hi>Christiā</hi> peace and cōmon tranquillity, floteth aloft
<pb facs="5"/> with singular honour (the Lord ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee eternally praised) and in the prime of their wished tide, hath put the <hi>Bul</hi> &amp; his <hi>Briggets</hi> to flight, which were prepared for her decaye. Nowe may <hi>Israel</hi> say, and that truely: <hi>Except the Lord had bene of our side, we had sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perished.</hi> But this is the Lordes owne doing, and let it bee still marueilous in our eies.</p>
   <p>And herehence <hi>English Israell</hi> praye thou to God hartily, and turne effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the Lorde thy God,<note place="margin">Hosea. 14.</note> trust no more in <hi>Ashur,</hi> nor in thine owne strength, for doest thou not see, that death &amp; thy destruction was entered the <hi>Presence,</hi> where neyther barbed horse, or Cannō shot could haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed? watch &amp; pray, for Satan is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <pb facs="5"/> of <hi>Rome</hi> by sea and lande (the <hi>Iudas Iesuits</hi> &amp; their reconciled) which counterfeite the forface of fined sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are in truth by Touch, not better mettall, then the rust of yron: <hi>Euen rebellious Traytors, walking craftely, Brasse and yron. They are all destroyers. The bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are burnt, the lead is consumed in the fier. The founder melteth in vaine:</hi>

   </p>
   <p>Let the sage headed soūd the depth of the popish profession, and recorde their precious practise from first till now. And hereto adioine the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Prince, the labours of the preachers, the loue to win by pollicie in the Counsell, and forgette not the prayers of the iust, for their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which still seeke our confusion and say as thou seest (if thine eye bee cleare) whether our <hi>Absolute Papistes,</hi> be not <hi>Resolute Rust,</hi> as before is said? For surely our most gracious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with her pitifull <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,</hi> cannot melt, their <hi>sacrylegious</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> malice against her long suffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but euen now after so many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed benefites from the Lord, by her Maiestie bestowed vpon thē, &amp; vs in common (were it but our long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed peace) the degenerate brattes of this fertile soile, doe with eagre moode hunt in hungre, the innocent bloude of her sacred bosome: whose Romishe thirst, cannot bee quenched except their <hi>Romulus,</hi> drinke carowse in her guiltles bloude. The blowing bellows of gods holy spirit, &amp; worde (the godly preachers) cannot make pure that which is but drosse: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they spende their liues in their labors, al in vaine, vppon these <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists:</hi> Or hath the apt matter by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full art, more speedely to melte the mettal, to say: the godly pollicy of the most honorable Councell with these so wicked menne any better successe: For in recompence of their honours good pollicie to procure these: they may happely find (could they possibly lend them hearing) that the rust of these <hi>Romanists,</hi> woulde rather seek to
<pb facs="6"/> win a <hi>Ioab</hi> in <hi>Dauid</hi> his Court,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.2.30.</note> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thē still fauour &amp; sparing, then by any their possible power they can sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be brought to Christiā obediēce. But still these Catholiques labour to harden some, but to hinder moe, &amp; they allure many (not of the worst calling) to draw away the faith of the most from God, and loyalty from her Maiesty, if so they could, and therfore our <hi>Recusants</hi> refuse their presence, to the holy word and sacraments which is the prefixed purging fornace, from a forced drosse, whatsoeuer. But now at last perceiuing all their hope to be at end, they bend their ouerbold bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in wickednes against her Maiesty &amp; this her highnes lād of vprightnes. Certes, in respecte of our purpose to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them the lande is vpright, &amp; in comparison with them and their Antichristian gouernement, it is the Lande of righteousnes: where the Gospell is sincerely Preached, the Lordes Sacramentes in substaunce soundly administred, and the seate of holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

      <note place="margin">Hosea. 4.1.2.3.</note> for the inhabitants thereof. In whose time muche wickednesse, great ignoraunce, and wilfull contempt of knowledge did ouerflowe the coast.

O Lord, farre be this blott from thy chosen nation of Englande. But in respecte of your Romishe reconciliation, wee confesse very many by you are made lame, and wickedly halt (which ought not once to limpe) before God, and to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, whose wickednes doe cause our dread of an heauye <hi>Censure,</hi> and the more: because your present practise is a threat from the Lord, of a direful daye, if our speedye <hi>Repentaunce,</hi> and faithfull prayers, stand not in the gap before him.<note place="margin">Psal. 106.23.</note> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
