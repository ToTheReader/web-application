   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Vch it were to be wished (Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that the same affection and feruent desire were in all true Christians, and especially in those that are Pastours and Teachers, to mainteine the truth, which we finde to be in false teachers and heretikes to vpholde and mainteine their errors. The Scribes and Pharisees in time past (as our Sauiour Matth. <hi>23,</hi> teacheth vs) <hi>compassed sea and land to make one of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And so in time past did the Nouatians, Donatists and Arians. But what need I to speake of times past, when we see before our eyes the present example of the Masse-priests and Iebusites, and their complices? They spare neither cost nor labour. some write, some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, some practise. one taketh on him one part of the labour, and another performeth the rest. So nothing is left vnattempted, that either fraud could deuise, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice execute, or industry and labour performe.</p>
   <p>Among others, one <hi>Kellison</hi> (not long since, as is said, my L. <hi>Vauxes</hi> Butler, but now a drawer of Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) hath shewed himselfe very busie: and for his part hath gathered together out of the libels of <hi>Staphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Cochleus, Bolsec, Sanders, William Reynolds,</hi> and other the Popes Parasits &amp; agents, a whole packe of
<pb facs="5"/>slanders, lies, and wicked imputations against <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon, Caluin, Beza,</hi> and other Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of truth. To this he hath also added diuers frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of certeine idle declamations of his owne, and the most malicious railing termes that either himselfe could deuise, or els finde out in his fellowes inuectiues. And all this put together, he calleth <hi>A Suruey of the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> by the termes of Noueltie, Heresie, Impietie, and such like; seeking to disgrace that Trueth which we professe.</p>
   <p>I did therefore expect, that some learned man or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would take this fellow to taske, and indeed I doe now vnderstand, that a man both learned, graue and eminent in this Church of England hath both vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and finished the Answer to his scurrilous discourse. but seeing the same is not yet published, I thought it not amisse in the meane while to requite his <hi>Suruey of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> with this <hi>Suruey of Popery,</hi> and to draw home this idle wandring Surueyer &amp; Searcher of other mens matters, to a carefull consideration of his owne desperat cause.</p>
   <p>His Treatise is most foolishly titled <hi>A Suruey of the new religion.</hi> for neither shall he euer prooue, that one article of our religion is new, nor doth he dispute against any grounds held by vs, but only telleth of certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant speeches, partly falsely imputed to <hi>Luther, Caluin, Zuinglius,</hi> and other priuat men, and partly falsely gathered out of their words by false constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but had they held any priuat opinions, that iustly might be censured, what is that to vs? our religion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, is not grounded vpon <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> or any late Teacher, but vpon the Prophets and Apostles. neither
<pb facs="5"/>is our faith that, which is found in priuat mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but that which is founded vpon holy Scriptures, and conteined in our publicke confessions. he might therefore with more reason haue called it a surfet of his owne fooleries and fantasticall deuices and calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then a suruey of our religion.</p>
   <p>Against this idle inuention of <hi>Kellison,</hi> I haue, I hope, opposed a more diligent and certeine suruey of Popery. for I haue not deuised any thing of mine owne, but truely reported the doctrine which they teach. and herein I do not obiect whatsoeuer is taught by <hi>Scotus, Aquinas, Durandus, Biel, Stapleton, Harding, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> or which other Doctours do holde singulerly, nor that which <hi>Sanders, Parsons,</hi> or such idle fellowes babble in their trifling books, but only that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defined in some Councell, or determined by some Pope, or generally taught or practised by all, or most, or best of our aduersaries, and which I thinke <hi>Kellison</hi> will not deny. And by these grounds, doctrines and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I hope to ouerthrow the whole frame and building of Popery, being layd vpon weake grounds, and consisting of many wicked and false doctrines, and being maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by most leud and wicked meanes and practises.</p>
   <p>This Discourse I first deuised for a priuat friend, whose wauering (for I will not say defection, vntill I see surther) I do much lament, and whose settlement I doe much desire. but because I doe thinke the same may doe good to many, who not knowing the trueth we hold, nor the errours, heresies, superstitions, idolatry and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Popery, do runne headlong vpon occasion either of malcontentment, or desire of innouation in matters of State, which they consider may soonest be stirred by
<pb facs="6"/>quarrels about religion, into strange courses; I haue beene perswaded to make it common. the same also may serue to reclaime the most haggard Papists, if they doe not wilfully shut their eyes, and stoppe their eares against the trueth. thirdly, this may serue to stoppe the mouth of the slandrous Iebusites and Masse-priests, that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to vs wicked opinions and practises no way defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are vnable to defend their owne doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, which they publikely professe, and commend. si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I hope wise Christians may learne by these collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ours, neither to trust the aduersary, who maketh no conscience of lying or slandring, nor to condemne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, before they be heard and conuicted.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe therefore (gentle Reader) to reade our Discourse with attention, and to iudge without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. and then I doubt not but thou wilt beware both of the impious doctrines, and of the iniurious and leud practises of Popery.</p>
   <p>If any be offended with this surueying course, let him impute the fault to <hi>Kellison,</hi> who of a drunken butler, is now become a mad surueyer. and if he finde not texts or proofs sufficient to satisfie his humour in proofe of euery allegation in this Treatise; let him thinke, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of that nature, that either they will be confessed of the aduersary, or els are notoriously knowen to the world, though impudently denied by the polshorne packe of Antichrist.</p>
   <p>Finally, as there is but one Faith, one Baptisme, one God; so there is but one true religion, which euery one is to know and to embrace, if he will be saued. And this is grounded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ being the chiefe corner stone.
<pb facs="6"/>but as <hi>Athanasius orat. 2, contr. Arianos,</hi> sayth of the Arians, <hi>Pro Christo apud illos Arius est,</hi> that is, <hi>They follow Arius as if he were Christ;</hi> so we may say of the Papists, The Pope is their Christ, their head, their lode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starre, their Northpole, and all in all. This one true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is also Apostolicke and Catholicke, and most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>Tertullian lib. 1. contr. Marcionem,</hi> teacheth vs, <hi>Whatsoeuer doctrine hath beene brought into the Church after the first publication of the Gospel, that the same is to be reputed heresie. Haeresis deputabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> sayth he, <hi>quod postea inducitur.</hi> but Popery neuer came from the Apostles, but from the Pope. neither was the same vniuersally or anciently receiued, but onely taught and embraced by the Popes faction of late times, and within certeine limits. finally, this true and aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion is of God, and not of the inuention of Popes, or their polshorne Priests, Monks or Friers.</p>
   <p>Embrace therefore that religion, that is deriued from the Apostles and Prophets, that is truly Catholicke, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke, and most ancient, and finally, which hath no authour but God. and beware of all profane nouelties and Popish inuentions. and then as thou walkest by faith in this life, so thou shalt atteine to the vision of the face of God in the life to come, and also reigne with God euerlastingly through Christ, which is the Way, the Truth, and Life.</p>
