   <p>IF this Honorable man were now aliue, he would wonder more than ever he did, at the resolutenes of our Bishops. In holding their Courtes in their owne names. For bv <hi>M. Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertons</hi> speach; at a committee of both houses,
<pb n="94" facs="51"/>
in the second Session of this Parliament it was made so playne, that the Bishops were in the Kings mercy, for having seales of jurisdiction bearing their owne, and not the Kings armes, and holding Courtes in their owne names, and not the Kings, that <hi>S. Iohn Popham</hi> then Lord cheife Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>S. Edward Cooke</hi> then the Kings Atturney generall, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same to be true. The reason was this: In the first Session of this Parliament cap. <hi>25.</hi> that Statute of <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> which this worthy Counsailour of State mentioneth, is repealed. By which repeale the Statute of <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by him mentioned is restored to life. But more hereof (perhappes) hereafter: In meane while, <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether those subjectes which haue taken the oath of supremacy be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne: If being cited by a processe which hath the seale of a Bishop, &amp; not of the King, they appeare to the Ordinaries Court held in the Bishops name, and not the Kings. Seeing such a processe, and Court so held be (by that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> now in force) sayd to be against the Kings prerogatiue, &amp; therefore both must be by none other than forreigne power. If so, <hi>Quaere 2.</hi> VVhether his Majesties subiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so cited to such a Court, be bound (in law) to make their appearance.</p>
