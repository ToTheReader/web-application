      </gap>e which are two (being both one in effect) so sure witnesses that no exception can be taken against ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thē) that the number of true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers is very small (especially in this last &amp; most corrupt age of the world, wherein as we haue it foretold in Scripture, faith is not to be found, but iniquity doth abound) and that most of those, who professe themselues to be Christians, deceiue both themselues with a false conceite, and also others with an hypocriticall shew of religion, when as in truth they know not what it meaneth. For many are so far from hauing religion in their hearts, that they are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norāt of the doctrine of regeneratiō, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the substaunce of religion doth consist, and without the which it is as impossible to attaine to eternall saluation, as it is for


<pb facs="3"/>
the cleare sunne-shine, and palpable darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be together in the same place. For although according to the rule of Christian loue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee iudge the best of the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of grace, taking for pure gold what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doth glister, yet most men are so estranged from God, hauing no sense of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eir mindes, nor any sauour of it in their wordes and deedes, being in their whole behauiour so farre from the practise of godlinesse, making no conscience of any duety belonging either to God or man, that we may bee bold (hauing sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the word of God) to thinke and say of them, that they are carnall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, not as yet called to the knowledge and obedience of the truth, howsoeuer they may bee, according to Gods secret counsell in the number of his elect.</p>
   <p>Thus men liue, and thus they die in the most fearefull state of eternall death: the which thing being duely weighed, would worke griefe euen in the hardest heart, and stirre it vp to a pittifull desire of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. For if we be iustly moued to pitty


<pb facs="3"/>
by beholding the moment any miseries of men, and the distressed state of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eir bodies being consumed with sores and sickenesse, and euen at deaths dore, how much more ought we to be grieued for the eternall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of their soules, not dying, but being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cleane dead in sinne, and yet liuing in that state which leadeth to vnspeakable torment, and the hot-burning furnace of the wrath of God? But helplesse pitty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th the euill, communicating it to those who before were free from it: and therefore wee are not here to rest, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put to our helping handes, and so both with hand and heart to endeuour the releeuing of this woefull and wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. But it there any help for this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all misery in the hands of any mā? can men worke this regeneration in themselues, or in others, and so chaunge a carnall and sinfull man into a holy and new creature? No surely: regeneration is the proper work of the omnipo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ent God, impossible to bee brought to passe by man, angell, or any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for althogh many creatures haue life in


<pb facs="4"/>
them selues, yet none can giue naturall, much lesse spirituall life to another. So then belike, there is not any duty looked for at mans handes in this behalfe, but onely that he pitty and bewaile his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens desperate estate: and the blame of mens sinfulnesse and damnation, is not to be laid on men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ho cannot helpe though they would, but on God, who keeping this faculty of regenerating men in his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne handes, neither him selfe helpeth man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet maketh it possible for man to helpe him selfe. This may seeme to follow of the aforesayd ground, but it is not in any case to bee admitted: for God doth both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> men by his spirite to eternall life and also hath appointed the meaanes by the which man is to worke his owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The which if he will not try and vse, who can eyther deny or doubt, but that the blame is in him selfe, and not in God: the which if he vsing cannot preuaile, yet the fault is in his owne corrupt nature, the which is so dead in sinne, that it cannot bee recouered, no not by good and sufficient


<pb facs="4"/>
means. For as touching the corruption of nature, the which, wee confesse maketh it impossible for a man to renew himfelf, God is not in any wise to be thought the author of it: for he created man in perfect holines, but man did carelesly &amp; wilfully loose that holines, which God gaue vnto him. But as for the neglect and contempt of the means, which God hath appointed for the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of holines, man can not but take that wholly to himself, who although he cannot renew himself thogh he wold, yet if he will hee may vse the meanes appointed for that purpose, as will more plainly appeare in the particulars. But mā, who (for <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> most part) is carelesse of eternall saluation, yea altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnwilling to take that paines in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, which is required of all those, who desire to finde it, will alledge in defence of this his wilfull contempt of Gods word, that it were folly for him to seeke regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which it is not in his power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. VVhereunto we answer, that no man ought to despaire of the truth, goodnesse, mercie or power of God, and make his


<pb facs="5"/>
sinfulnesse the greater, and his damnation the more iust and grieuous: but rather doe his endeuour in the carefull and continuall vse of the means, as God hath commanded, and so leaue both the successe of his labour, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is owne saluation, to the wil and good pleasure of God. The which that we may doe, it is needefull that we kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, the meanes whereby regeneration may be attained vnto, or at the least ought to be sought after.</p>
   <p>It is not gold or siluer, (although <hi>Simon Magus</hi> supposed, that spirituall graces might be bought with money, as worldly commodities are) that can purchase regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not fauour, friendship, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of holinesse, but onely the vsing of the meanes which God hath appointed.</p>
   <p>The meanes of Regeneration, is the way leading vnto it, called in Scripture <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> in the Greek tong <hi>Metanoia,</hi> that is, an after minde, or a right mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wrong minde: for as in other matters it commeth daily to passe, that men being in processe of time brought by experience to


<pb facs="5"/>
see their owne errours wherein they haue done amisse, are displeased with themselues for so doing, with that they had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and so are said to repent of this or that action: so a carnall man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>auing all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is life time liued in vaine and sinfull pleasures, altogether carelesse of the seruice of God, and of his owne saluation, at length seeth the vanity of his life past, is grieued for it, and wisheth (although too late) that he had taken an other course. Yea, together with his minde he changeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ill, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and his whole life, vtterly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and disclaiming all those vices and sinnes, wherein before he delighted and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and labouring to frame and inure him selfe to a vertuous and christian dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde and life. This state wee haue plainely set do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne vnto vs, in the parable of that prodigall young man, who hauing wasted his money, time &amp; strength in riot, commeth at length to his right wits, and to a sober kinde of life.</p>
   <p>This is that state of man, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt sencelesse security, or open propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb facs="6"/>
wherein he seldome or neuer thinketh of God (whom perhaps he thinketh neither to exist in him selfe, nor to worke any way in the world): or of his owne saluation, he neuer dreaming of any other world, then this which hee doth presently enioy, and wherein hee placeth his whole happinesse. In this first estate (which may truely bee called <hi>Atheisme</hi>) man is most wretched as in all other respectes, so chiefely, in that he accounting him selfe happy (as all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men doe who are free from outward crosses) is for the present without any kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ledge, desire, hope, or likelyhood of any better estate. In the second estate also (the which in this Treatise wee call the state of <hi>Repentance)</hi> man is as yet not happy but miserable: yet happy in this one respect, for that he knowing himselfe to be wretched, doth earnestly desire, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeuour, and may well hope to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happy. But in the third estate, to wit, in regeneration, he knoweth him selfe to be both happy and holy, and laboreth for the perfectiō of it, &amp; by vertue of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse


<pb facs="6"/>
which he hath receiued from God, to ouercome that sinfulnesse which he hath by nature. The second state, is the way leading from the first to the third, from sinne to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, from death to life, the conuersion of a sinner, not to God (for he is as yet as farre from him, as hell, or rather as the earth is from Heauen) but onely towardes God, and the preparation for grace and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commaunded vnto vs by the name of <hi>Repentance.</hi> Thus the ministery of <hi>Iohn</hi> was the ministery of Repentance, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, not so much to teach Christ and the doctrine of the Gospell, or to worke faith, as by preaching the doctrine of the Law, to bring men to a sight and sense of sinne, that so they might be stirred vppe to Christ the pardoner of sinne. Thus he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his office and ministery, Math. <hi>3.3. The voice of a Crier in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, prepare the waie of the Lord, and make his pathes straight.</hi> And this was the summe of all his Sermons, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the kingdome of Heauen is at hand.</hi> Likewise, in other places of


<pb facs="7"/>
Scripture, the word <hi>Repentance</hi> is thus taken: alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ough sometimes put for Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or sanctification it selfe, yet vsually distinguished from it, as being but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue vnto it. As Math. <hi>21.32. You did not repent to beleeue.</hi> Or, that so you might haue beleeued: and Act. <hi>2.38. Repent and be baptized for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne, and yee shall receiue the gift of the holy Ghost,</hi> and Act. <hi>8.22. Peter</hi> saith to <hi>Simon Magus, Repent, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee.</hi> And thus we take it in this Treatise for the naturall conuersion of a man to God, wrought in a man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (as it seemeth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was, <hi>Iohn 3.4.</hi> although he did seeke saluatiō) yet being the meanes of regeneration.</p>
   <p>This way or this ladder, whereby we are to clime vp to regeneration, hath foure steps, for so we will make a homely and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar diuision of it, that it being set down in many seuerall partes, may the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vnderstood and knowen. The first step


<pb facs="7"/>
which is to be made by this carnal man now repenting, is to get the true knowledge of his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne estate, to wit, how sinfull and wretched he is in him selfe by nature, and at t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is present. The second step is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or contrition, wrought in him by the due consideration of his own estate. The third, is a full purpose or resolution of mind to seeke for grace and regeneration. The fourth and last part, is the diligent vsing of the meanes appointed by God, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of grace: the which meanes are three in number. The first is amendment of life: the second, the hearing of Gods word: the third is praier, or inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of God.</p>
