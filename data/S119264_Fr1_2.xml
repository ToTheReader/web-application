      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst other things,
wherewith the learned
Satyre taxeth the times
wherein hee liv'd, this was one,
that they were desperately farr
spent with a sickness which hee
calls the <hi>Scribendi Cacoethes,</hi> or the
scribling disease: The Infection
whereof (as may seeme) was then
so strong, that the contagion of it,
hath runn all along in a veine, (like
the knotty Farcye in a horses side)
from Age to Age, to this very Age
vvherein wee breath; seeing (as
then) so now, <hi>tenet insanabile multos,
Scribendi Cacoethes;</hi> many Crow-Poets,
<pb facs="3"/>
and Pye-Poetesses, Rhimers,
and poor versers, (<hi>quales ego, vel Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vienus,</hi>)
such as I, and bauld <hi>Cluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus,</hi>
as well as those true witts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
who can deserve that of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil
to Varus, (Sola Sophocleo tua Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina
digna Cothurno,</hi>) even all sorts,
learned and unlearned, (like the
cleane, and uncleane Beasts, posting
to the Ark, and (with the Ape) doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the whelpes of their own
Brayn, and breeding, doe, (even to
the oppressing therof,) daily throng
to the Press, (every one gasping
greedily after the sweet ayre of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
praise: whereof some are so
ambitious, that (rather then lose it)
(with the Dutchess of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in
<hi>Hen.</hi> 7. time,) having no children
of their own, to serve their turn)
<pb facs="3"/>
they will set forth a Child of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
begetting: and (with the
Cuckoe, sucking up the Eggs of an
other Birds laying,) set themselves
down in the Nest, and there lay
their own name, (in steed of an
Egg) at the foot of the dedication;
which beeing thus hatcht, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, gulls the credulous
world, as if the whole Nest had
been of their own stuff, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and in steed of beeing an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Steward to the right Author,
(against all true practise of piety,)
(with <hi>Ziba,</hi>) make themselves
Heyres to an other mans paynes
and praise: Others also the world
hath heard of, who (beeing no less
ambitious of this vulgar applause,
though quite bankerupt of all abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb facs="4"/>
to deserve it,) are also so envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that (with <hi>Richard</hi> the third,)
they will smother the Royall and
learned labours of other men.</p>
   <p>In this scribling itching Age,
wherein for a Man to doe, as the
most doe, is to bee least noted,
(with him in the Lottery,) content
to bee a Foole for Company, <hi>En e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Musarum rudis, et pauperculus hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi>
I, that am not worthy (gentle
Reader) to hould a Trencher to the
Muses, have (with bouldness i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
thrust my hand into the
dish amongst them, and doe heere
presēt thee with some of the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which I found at their Table:
Take them as the pastime of my
pastimes, and the Recreations and
Interims, which in my younger
<pb facs="4"/>
time, I reserved from sports &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
(especially that bewitching
Inticement of Hawkes, and hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which have flowne away with
so much of my most pretious time;
and wherein the greatest and the
best part of the young Nobility &amp;
Gentry of this Land, (by an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and worse continued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome)
doe ravl'e out a great part
of their goulden dayes, as if the
<hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the end of all their
carefull and chargeable education.
at home and abroad, were onely to
make them ripe and fit for the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
service of Hawkes &amp; Hounds,
and other poorer sports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
(whose rare and seldome use
is indeed their greatest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
Long have these trifles of my
<pb facs="5"/>
paynes lyne imprisoned by mee,
and some of them, above treble the
time that <hi>Horace</hi> injoynes, (<hi>ut nonū
premantur in Annum:</hi>) yet now at
last I have granted them an <hi>exeatis</hi>
into the world: I will not deny, that
they had long since adventured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but that I still looked, and as
much desired, that some good able
Poet would have taken this taske
in hand, much wondring, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the other Latin Authours,
both in prose &amp; poetry, had found
so much curtesie amongst sundry
of our ingenious Countrimen, to
bee taught to expresse their mynds
very happily in our <hi>English</hi> tongue,
and that this Author, (so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in all times, as the Prince
and parragon of all Latin poesie,
<pb facs="5"/>
should yet stand still as a <hi>noli me
tangere,</hi> whom no man, either durst
or would undertake: onely Master
<hi>Spencer</hi> long since translated the
Gnat, (a little fragment of <hi>Virgils</hi>
excellence,) giving the world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
to conceive, that hee
would at one time or other have
gone through the rest of this Poets
workes: and it is not improbable,
that this very cause was it, that
made every man els very nice to
meddle with any part of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which hee had begun, for
feare to come short with disgrace,
of the pattern which hee had set
before them: as none would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
(for the same reason,) to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the pourtraict of <hi>Venus,</hi> which
<hi>Apelles</hi> left behind him unperfect,
<pb facs="6"/>
at his death: Wherefore I make no
doubt, but this which I doe, wilbee
addomed against mee for a bould,
and a daring deed: but <hi>Epistola non
erubescit:</hi> and now they are out of
my hands, I hope they will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learne so much Impudence of
the world, into which they are
crowding, that a little blushing wil
serve their turn: some Readers I
make no doubt they wil meet with
in these dainty mouth'd times, that
will taxe them, for not comming
resolved word for word, and line
for line with the Author: To whom
(if any such chance to bee) I onely
say: That this small Indeavour of
mine beeing at first undertaken
onely for my own private delight,
my homely Muse drest the whole
<pb facs="6"/>
feast, according as shee knew it
would best please my own tast and
dyet, (<hi>Coquus enim Domini debet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
gulam:</hi>) &amp; I used the freedome
of a Translator, not tying my selfe
to the tyranny of a Grammaticall
Construction, but breaking the
shell into many peeces, was onely
carefull to preserve the kernell safe
and whole, from the violence of a
wrong, or wrested Interpretation;
for as wee cannot chide him for
an ill tasker, that beates the Corne
clean out of the straw, though yet
hee thresh it not Eare by Eare, or
sheafe by sheafe, in the same order,
as it first grevv in the Field. neither
are vvee vvont to discōmend those
Hounds, vvho spending their
mouths merrily together, trayl the
<pb facs="7"/>
Hare home to her forme, though
they hunt not all the while so close
within the compass of a sheet, nor
hitt every head, or every double in
the very direct track, that the Hare
prickt it out before them: &amp; as wee
doe not condemn that Greyhound
to run fowle, that (with good foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
courseth the Deer straight
vvithout coasting, though his
strayns bee more or fevver, shorter
or longer then the Deeres, and his
turns not all so nimble and round,
in the same narrovv compass toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Hare: Nor doe wee
hould that Falcon any bad Hawk,
who (working her selfe into a good
Kill-ducks place, &amp; flying jump &amp;
round) stoops frankly, strikes sure,
and comes home close to the very
<pb facs="7"/>
blank water, though yet shee come
not so close, as to ineau, or goe to
plunge together with the Fowle:
no more do I conceive heerein my
course to be faulty, though I do not
affect to follow my Authour so
close, as to tread upon his heeles;
if yet I can keep at a neerer distance
unto him, then <hi>Creusa</hi> to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
in their going out of <hi>Troy,</hi> so
as neither to loose my self, nor my
Guide, in so difficult and dark a
journy; houlding my selfe for a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Travayler, to have held my
Author all the way by the hand (as
<hi>Ascanius</hi> did <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in the darke
night of their trudging out of the
massacre) howsoever my short-legd
Muse, (not able to take so long
strydes) have walked with him (as
<pb facs="8"/>
that young stripling with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>non passibus aequis.</hi> Every line of
this Poet, in his own language, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the acceptance of the very
best Reader: but the language
vvhich I have taught him; (not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to stand upon justification by
merit, and therefore needing rather
pardon then acceptance,) appeales
unto your curtesies with that limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
vvherevvith the good <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
bespake the Romans, on his
death-bed, in the behalf of his tvvo
young sonns (<hi>si promerebuntur:</hi>) or
(if I should use any other insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
it should bee that which <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi>
as bad a Man, as I can bee a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi>)
used to K. <hi>David,</hi> because <hi>I</hi> am
the first, that have met my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
with these dainty Aeclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
<pb facs="8"/>
in our English tongue: which
(beeing like Riddles, wrapt up in a
Mask, and under a clowd of reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
sense, &amp; a double Meaning,) <hi>I</hi>
have sent abroad with a Gloss bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from divers learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as strangers with a guide to
direct them in an unknown vvay:
not doubting, but some can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vvell content to delight their
tasts vvith the pleasant juice, as
their eye vvith the outvvard rhind
of these goulden Pastoralls.</p>
   <p>To tender either the Text or the
Gloss, the Garment, or the Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,
(as they are mine,) to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sort, were to offer to light up a
Taper before the Sunn, or to bring
Farthings (though a currant Coyn)
in payment unto the exchequer:
<pb facs="9"/>
but amongst those of my own
growth, and last, of knowledge and
understanding, perhaps (formy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
sake) the one may bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and the other welcome, (as a
hand to draw aside the Curtaynes
from delicate Pictures) that so they
may discover the face at least,
though not the whole body of the
Poets meaning. But least I may
draw an imputation of having my
wings broader then my nest, or my
porch larger then my house, with
equall respect to all according to
the rank and quality of every seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Reader. I rest.</p>
