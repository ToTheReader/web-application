      <p>FOr the easier and readier vnderstanding hereof (sith many places carie diuerse numbers both in respect of Part and Page) it shalbe necessarie to note, that all such figures as stand thus inclasped or imbraced [1] [2] [3] or [4] doe signifie the 1. 2. 3. or 4. Part, (remembring alwaies that the whole volume is Quadripartite or consisting of 4. Parts, besides the additions, which may be a supposed Part by themselues:) the other figures, as they fall more or lesse, doe import the page or side of the leafe. Note further, that (A) inferreth the first columne (as we commonlie call it) or partition of any page, (B) the second. And thus much brieflie by way of aduisement.</p>
