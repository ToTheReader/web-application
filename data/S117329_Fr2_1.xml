      <hi>Hierome</hi> said, that <hi>the liuely voyce had a secret force, and being powred from the mouth of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker into the eares of the hearer, hath a stronger and more powerful sound.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Aeschines,</hi> when he had read the oration

which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had made against him, and perceiued that the people did greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the force and excellencie of it; answered them, <note n="d" place="margin">Quid si ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam audisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis bestiam, sua verba resonantem.

      <hi>What would you haue thought, if you had heard him pronounce it with his owne mouth?</hi> Yet writing hath his vse and profit: both for the instruction of those which did not heare the doctrine deliuered by liuelie voyce, and also for the helpe of their memories which before heard it. Our Sermons are like an vntimely fruite, which dieth so soone as it is borne, they are forgotten so soone as they are heard. And therefore as <hi>Paul was not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>
      <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 1.</note>
      <hi>to write the same things to the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> but thought it <hi>a sure thing for them:</hi> so wee neede not to be ashamed to write those things which before we preached, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may the better vnderstand and remember the same.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I was willing to giue a publike te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of that godly Gentlewomans death, at whose buriall it was preached: to cleere her from the slanderous reports of her popish neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, who will not suffer her to rest in her graue, but seeke to disgrace her after her death. It is not vnknowne to them which either reade the histories of these later times, or are acquainted with popish practises, that the religiō of Papists,


<pb facs="3"/>
was first set vp, and is still maintained by <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and <hi>lyes.</hi> By <hi>crueltie,</hi> in murthering the Martyrs, in persecuting the Protestants, and now of late in these parts, in beating and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bodies, in killing &amp; spoyling the cattell of those which withstand them by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. By <hi>lyes,</hi> in teaching forged miracles to confirme their owne doctrine, and in spreading abroad false reports against our best professors to hinder our doctrine: as they haue bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled them for the course of their liues; so haue they most shamefully slaundered them for the manner of their death. It would make a mans eares to tingle to heare what malitious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and manifest vntruths some of the Romish faction haue published, concerning the death of <note n="e" place="margin">
