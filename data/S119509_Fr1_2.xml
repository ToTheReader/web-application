   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL THE RENOWMED CAPTEINE Christopher Carleill Esquier, chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of her Maiesties forces in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Vlder in the Realme of Ireland, and Seneshall there of the Countries of Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, the Rowte, the Glins, the Duffre, and Kylultaugh.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Worshipfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindfull of the saying which the auncient poet <hi>Hesiod</hi> vseth, whereby he doth iustly admonish (as imitating the earth) to recompence benefites with increase, though I dispaire to requite your manie curtesies affoorded me, &amp; so must be checked of that dumbe
<pb facs="3"/>creature, yet I intende to imitate the the rockes and answer so loud a voice with a resounding Echo, and though in comparison of the voice I speake but the last sillable, yet I hope your Worship regarding rather my good meaning than my gift, will affoord your patronage to this little booke, &amp; shrowd it vnder the protection of your Heroicall spirit, where I doubt not it shall obtaine fauour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by find passage without repulse: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also it containeth in it that which most men desire, both delight to the eye and harmonie to the eare, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to both and offence to none. I haue the rather presumed to hope of your Worships good acceptance for two causes: the one for that I see the like to haue ben done in the same booke being in French and Latin by verie honorable and vertuous perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, to whom in mine account your
<pb facs="3"/>Worship is nothing inferior. For to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit al discourse and to touch only the bare names of some things managed by your selfe: Let the sundrie great proofes of your martiall seruices and worthie aduentures as well by land as by sea witnes what your deserts haue bene, which the Spanish west India with losse and griefe; Muscouia or Russia with worthy commendation; France, the Low Countries, and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with renowmed fame haue with generall voice and consenting occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, euen from them all to both farre and neere sounded &amp; emblased, wherein can not be forgotten your zeale alwaies shewed towards Christs Gospell, besides manie other your rare vertues accōpanied with a chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberalitie and a most curteous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilitie towards all men, whereof my selfe among the rest haue sufficiently tasted from time to time. The other
<pb facs="4"/>for that sometimes I haue noted your Worship to be well delighted with the substance &amp; nature of this worke, as well in your beholding of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Emblemes, which haue bin worthie personages, as also in your deuising &amp; setting downe some from your owne conceit, which if I coulde haue recouered, as once I was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and shewed some of them by one of your seruantes, who is now in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, I had here adioined them vnto the others. And so fearing I haue ben somewhat too tedious I humbly take my leaue in recommending my labor to your good fauour, and my selfe to do you seruice in any thing I may be able. London the third of Ianuarie. 1591.</p>
