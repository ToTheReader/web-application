      <l>AT Brentforde on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> west of London</l>
      <l>Nigh to a place that called is Syon</l>
      <l>Ther dwelt a widow of a holy sort</l>
      <l>Honest in substance &amp; full of sport</l>
      <l>Da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ly she could with pastime and Iests</l>
      <l>Among her neighbours and her guests</l>
      <l>She kept an Inne of right good lodging</l>
      <l>For all estates that thither were comming</l>
      <l>It chaunced this widow as it is supposed</l>
      <l>In her sporte and merily disposed</l>
      <l>After her death for a remembrance</l>
      <l>Thought to haue some matter of pastance</l>
      <l>For p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ople to laughe at in such company</l>
      <l>As are disposed for to talke merily</l>
      <l>Mingled with many proper scoffes &amp; boords</l>
      <l>Of sundry tauntes with some me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>y wordes</l>
      <l>The which I haue heard at many seasons</l>
      <l>Full of pastime with prety reasons</l>
      <l>For yf any did a thing ouerthwart</l>
      <l>They saide euer ye shall haue a fart</l>
      <l>Of Iyll of Brantford for your paine</l>
      <l>The which laying oft troubled my brayne</l>
      <l>For I neuer kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>w what the matter was</l>
      <l>Nor could the meaning bring to passe</l>
      <l>Till at the last vpon a day</l>
      <l>I met on Iohn hardlesay</l>
      <l>A mery felow in ech company</l>
      <l>Which said Copland thou lookest dry</l>
      <l>The truthe quod I is as ye say</l>
      <l>For I drank not of al this day</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>And of a short tale to make an end</l>
      <l>to the red lyon at the shambles end</l>
      <l>We went for to drink good ale</l>
      <l>and as he was telling his tale</l>
      <l>I offered him for to drink first</l>
      <l>Copland quoth he art thou a thirst</l>
      <l>And biddeth me afore the to drink</l>
      <l>to my iudgement I do think</l>
      <l>Of Iyll of Brentforde worthy thou art</l>
      <l>by her bequest to haue a fart</l>
      <l>And truly now is come to my mynde</l>
      <l>not long ago how I did finde</l>
      <l>An olde scrow all ragged and rent</l>
      <l>beseming it is some mery entent</l>
      <l>As diuers say that do it reed</l>
      <l>but gallant toyes ther semes indeed</l>
      <l>It is Antick, broken / and so raced</l>
      <l>that all the cheef is clene defaced</l>
      <l>Take it and I pray the hartely</l>
      <l>looke theron and if thou espy</l>
      <l>That it be of any substance</l>
      <l>of mirth or of honest pastaunce</l>
      <l>And where thou spiest that it dooth want</l>
      <l>or where for lack the matter is scant</l>
      <l>Put to it as is according</l>
      <l>to the matter in euery thing</l>
      <l>Keep it with thee, and take sum payne</l>
      <l>the poore mare shall haue his man again</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Whan I came home, at leisure</l>
      <l>My hart not parfitly at pleasure</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>For the losse of a certain freend</l>
      <l>As God knowes few be to finde</l>
      <l>For recreation I it toke</l>
      <l>to pas the time theron to loke</l>
      <l>And of troth oft in the reding</l>
      <l>it did stir me to fall on smiling</l>
      <l>Considering the prety pastime</l>
      <l>and rydicle order of the rime</l>
      <l>The couert termes, vnder a mery sence</l>
      <l>shewing of many the blinde insolence</l>
      <l>Taunting of things past and to come</l>
      <l>where as my self was hit with some</l>
      <l>And for that cause I did intend</l>
      <l>after this manner to haue it pend</l>
      <l>Praying all them that mery be</l>
      <l>if it touch them not to blame me</l>
