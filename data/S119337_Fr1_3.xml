   <head>SIMON DE VOYON TO ALL THOSE THAT DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIRE TO BE OF THE SAME CHVRCH AND, TRVE RELIGION OF GOD THE which hath beene from the beginning of the world, and shall be for euermore, health and peace through our Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit that many good and learned men haue made mention in their books of the doctors of the Church of God, yet I haue ben of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it will not be a thing vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this present to publish vp̄o the like matter this present discourse, being collected out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse authours, and compiled in one: after the manner and fashion that you see: deeming that it will be profitable to many who haue not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at wil to read much, to see hereby &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of a continuall order of good doctors wh̄o God hath raysed vp from the beginning of the world vntil this present time, &amp; how God hath euerlastingly collected for himselfe a perpetuall Church, through the word of the gospell, from this masse of sinne, that is to say, of men: amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest wh̄o the gospel which we heare at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, hath at all times shinned in the middest of most thicke darkenesse.</p>
   <p>And hereby we may see and vnderstand, that there neuer hath ben any maner of religon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be, which hath continued so long, and hath had such efficacie and vertue, so continuall an order, such and so wonderful a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the holy scriptures, as hath the Church
<pb facs="4"/>of God had, the which, like as shall be shewed in the discourse following, God himself hath min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euer since the beginning of the worlde to teach &amp; declare by the voice of his own son, after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he hath sēt his doctrin before by the ministerie of the holy fathers, Patriarches, Prophetes, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, Priestes, and Apostles: and lastly hath conserued the same by a singular grace and goodnesse vntil this present time, through faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bishops and good pastours, and doctours of the Church of God being sent frō time to time, and still placed in the roumes of others their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, the which same shal be conserued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, &amp; defended by a singular grace and goodnes of God, euen vnto the glorious comming of his sonne our lord Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>And thus, seing that God himselfe hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished blished and ordeined the ministery of his word, which we at this present do follow, we nede not to dout but that he doth and will alwaies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the same, as may easily be vnderstoode by the effectes of all tymes. For although that the deuill in his enchantmentes hath at all times found out a rage more then horrible against the Church and faithfull doctours: like as here is manifested by Abel, who was slaine by Caine, being moued thereto by a deuilish enuie: by the persecution and oppression of the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, by the high priestes, who were slaine by Saule, by Isay and Ieremie, who were put to death: by the captiuitie of the people, when they were carried away into Babylon: likewise
<pb facs="4"/>by Iohn Baptist, by our Lord Iesus Christ, and by the Apostles who haue beene cruelly slayne, and by so many millions of Martyrs: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstāding y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church hath continued through out all ages, and there haue beene alwayes doctours diuinely raysed vp in the places of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for to set vp agayne and to conserue the light of the doctrine, to make it shine in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of those peoples and Realmes that God woulde haue it. It hath then been alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and defended: for God is the protector and gardein thereof who maketh it to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande all such assaultes. And for this cause Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in his illusions of these times hath suggested and put in practyce the moste cruell tormentes that coulde be deuised: but all in vaine. There haue beene kindled fires great and small. There haue beene set vp also for the true Christians Scaffoldes &amp;c. some haue beene caste into the bottomes of ponds and riuers: and to conclude, Sathan hath by sword and force vsed all sortes of most cruel violences, for to cause that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy seruice of God might be altogether extinct and buried, but he neuer coulde, neither euer shall be able to doe it. Wee muste then consider and vnderstande, that true religion hath of GOD an efficacie and vertue more great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then any thinge that can bee, or euer hath bene, seeing that so mightie an enemie as sathā, the prince of the children of this world, hath so often and strongly besieged it, and yet coulde neuer hinder, but that alwayes thorough the
<pb facs="5"/>goodnes of God it shoulde be set vp.</p>
   <p>Now to speak of other religions which haue beene, and be, what continuance haue they had? what stedfastnesse and assurance of the trueth haue beene founde in them? what number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many as were professours of the same haue euer beene so steedfast in their religions, that they would euer suffer most cruell tortures therfore, like as haue done an infinite multitude for the assurance and steedfastnesse that they had in the trueth, which no man is able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by whome God woulde be glorified? So many and such manner of religions as haue ben haue they had euer such order, such a doctrine, which hath plainly shewed vnto them the truth of the being, of the first originall of things that haue bene since the beginning of the world, and of thinges that haue come to passe, and that bee daily accomplished, as God hath made his to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande from time to time, first by visions and oracles, and since euen vntill this present time by his Prophetes and Apostles? Such and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie religions which haue beene, howe coulde it euer be found in them, as may be founde in the true Church by the holy scriptures howe that the supernaturall, he who is euerlastingly, that is the Lorde Iehova, who of himselfe hath his being, and not of any others, and of him all thinges their beinges, hath by his eternall worde and spirite created all thinges, made and fashioned them, and by him, not by our owne force and vertue, wee haue such dignitie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb facs="5"/>aboue all creatures of the earth, that we were made according to his owne image, which excellencie and our first perfection was lost by our ingratitude in our first parentes: and that since that time we be and shall bee restored thereto againe in a more large perfection by the onely meanes of his onely sonne, by which he hath made vs: and that for the manifestation of his inestimable goodnesse and glorie, by the which he teacheth vs in his holy scriptures, and assureth vs by his spirite, that wee shall be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly taken vp to his glorie, forasmuch as he is able to doe so, and will doe it. So many and such sundrie sortes of religion as haue bene, had they euer yet since the beginning, of the world so continuall an order of good and faithfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who being inspired with the spirit of god, haue constantly taught and mainteined against all the rage of the worlde the trueth of his holy doctrine, as hath the right religion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, which is the verie Christianitie, done? Doth not GOD thereby and by sundrie other meanes sufficiently declare the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the ministerie of his holy worde, and true religion, which he from time to time hath approued, for asmuch as therein hee hath placed and set the true and pure infallible veritie, for to instructe and guide man euen vnto him who is the authour and creatour of all thinges.</p>
   <p>Nowe seeing that we haue such a founder of our religion, who giueth vs also grace to follow the same: let Sathan inuent as many meanes as
<pb facs="6"/>he will for to ouerthrow and extinguish it: Let him breath as many illusions and inchantmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes into the mindes of men as he can, for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, that this true religion which wee hold began but of late, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it shal soone decay againe &amp;c. It is notwithstanding most euident that it hath bene euer since the beginning of the worlde, and that wee haue testimonie of him who hath established the same, and may surely repose our confidence in him, that like as hee hath ordeined, that whilest the sunne &amp; Moone shall giue light to the earth, he will neuer faile to helpe and asiste his: and that finally we shall bee with our heade and Lorde Iesus Christ. And hereof we doe assure our selues, and doe feele of the same in our selues a certaintie proceeding of the spirite of God, that so it shall come to passe at the time which God hath ordained: neither is this religion that we holde false or wicked (as some yet say) inasmuch as it is grounded vpon y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> pure word of God, according to the which we labour and are willing to serue God, without mingling therewith any thing imagined by our owne braine (like as we be slaundered to do) for to make a religion of our owne deuising. And therefore let such vnderstande that this our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had not the first beginning at Luther or Iohn Hus, and that it was neuer hearde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as some falsely say, and that it shall not therefore long abide. For notwithstanding that thorough the great vngodlinesse and euill that hath beene and yet is amongst some men of the
<pb facs="6"/>Church, and thorough the outrage of carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with carelesnesse and not regarding the glorie of God or his trueth, yea through the verie contempt and falling away from God and all trueth, the doctrin which he had published &amp; set forth before by his Prophetes and Apostles, and by his sonne he hath suffered and bene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that this true religion should be by his most iust iudgement obscured and hidden from men so as they might not discerne it according to any outwarde appearaunce, neither that it could bee redressed by the good doctours: yea the trueth was so darkened, that to the view and outward iudgement of the worldly there coulde be seene no tracke or steppe of God in the Church, and that according to worlde mens fantasie, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that God had forsaken his Church, and giuen it vtterly to the spoyle, seeing that all was turned to ydolatrie and superstition, which God in his word sheweth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he misliketh &amp; most vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorreth, yet euen thē he had reserued some in his Church, that had neuer bowed the knee before the idoll Ball, before this Antichrist, for to consent vnto, or beleeue his doctrine, being directly against the pure worde of God, as came to passe in the time of Elias when the confusion and vngodlinesse of the people was such, that there was no semblance of the Church seene, in-in so much that this holy Prophete thought that all had beene vtterly giuen ouer vnto the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of images and to idolatrie: but he was deceiued: for God hath reserued seauen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes,
<pb facs="7"/>which neuer had bowed the knee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baal. And in like manner, if after the time of the primitiue Church the like also proued, that for the wickednesse and vnthankfulnesse of the people GOD suffered the like confusion and idolatrie to raigne: yet we muste vnderstande, that forasmuch as God is one and the selfe same God, aswell nowe as he was in the time of the Apostles, that hee hath reserued vnto himselfe through all ages seauen thousande (yea an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number) which neuer bowed their knees before this stately ydoll, before this man of sinne this sonne of perdition, who sitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. The faithfull, I say, haue not sought for saluation in his doctrine: but rather forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and renouncing that, haue beene assured in their heart by the spirite of God, to obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the alone meane and merites of Iesus Christ our onely sauiour.</p>
   <p>They therefore be of a wrong opinion, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che iudge and esteeme the Church of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fantasie, not to haue continued alwayes. If the doctours, who were verie god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and righteous, haue not wel discerned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie and true religion of his Church: and moreouer, if that this excellent Prophet, who was filled with the spirit of God so aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was so much deceiued when hee woulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humaine iudgement recken the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD: what may wee thinke shal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto vs, whose iudgement (for the moste parte) is altogether vnperfecte. They are also
<pb facs="7"/>deceiued and doe foolishly and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously which iudge the number of the electe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacitie of their senses: for God hath a meane, to him nothing difficult, but to vs vnknowne, by the which he may conserue his elect marueilously, then when all seemeth tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpside downe and spoyled. Well may the elect then be persecuted, but neuer confounded, nor the Church extinct, insomuch as it hath God for the founder and defendour, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect haue God the creatour of heauen and earth for their gardein and protector: like as he hath neuer fayled to helpe his at all seasons with the assistance of his holy spirite making euen seene and knowne to the worlde his greate loue and care towarde them throughout all ages, as hath beene euidently seene. Let vs not doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the trueth of him who hath promised to abide with vs vntill the ende of the worlde, of which his promise we see and feele daily effectes albeit y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we are vnworthie thereof. Thus much haue I thought good to speake concerning the continuance of the true Church, whose founder is Christ. Nowe will I shew briefely the order of the discourse following, which is this: That all the gouernement of the Church which hath beene from the beginning of the worlde vntill this present, is comprised in fiue orders: the first this present, is comprised in fiue orders: the first of which contayneth the first fathers, to wit, from Adam, who was instructed by the son of God &amp;c. The second of the Patriarches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at Abraham. The third of the Prophets,
<pb facs="8"/>and beginneth at Samuel. The fourth the high priestes and gouernours, and beginneth at Iosue otherwise called Iesus, and at the conductour Zorobabell. The fift and last beginneth at Iohn Baptist and our Lorde Iesus Christ, and at his Apostles and their disciples, Bishops &amp; Pastours that succeeded after them, and euen vnto the Bishops whom God hath raised vp also in these last times, for the mainteinance of his Church, and for to correct the errours and abhominable traditions of men which doe infect the true and pure doctrin of God, the which he hath confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and will conserue for euer, for the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his Church. For the which also O Lorde I beseech thee, that thou wilt nowe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more sende good and faithfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, true setters foorth of thy worde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all the real mes and prouinces, to the ruine and destruction of the kingdome of this man of sinne, Antichrist: and to the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the kingdome of thy sonne Iesus Christ our onely saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Lord Amen.</p>
