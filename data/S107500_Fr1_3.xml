   <p>IT is no small fauour of God to bee made an instrument of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good: which is either by our owne free donations, or by disposing of others gifts: In the one is manifested our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in giuing of our owne: and in the other our faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in truely performing the will of the dead. And to vse the Apostles words, <hi>What haue we that wee haue not receiued?</hi> not simply for our owne vse, but for the good of others also: Therefore, that wee may not be found vncharitable, we must giue of our owne, nor vnfaithfull, we must be true in bestowing of others gifts: and then we shall bee twice blessed with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and haue a double portion with <hi>Beniamin.</hi> But to bring this home to the doores of your consciences: Yea, Worshipfull company of <hi>Cloth-workers,</hi> for whome I in particular am bound to pray, not so much for your owne donation vnto mee, as your faithfull pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which others haue giuen for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of religion. Of whom I may say, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did
<pb facs="6"/>
of <hi>Ierusalem, Many excellent things are spoken of thee, thou Citie of God:</hi> so many excellent things are done by you: Yea, worthy and worship full <hi>Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers,</hi> with <hi>Dorcas</hi> you make coates to clothe the naked: with the <hi>Shunammite,</hi> you prepare houses for the harbourlesse to dwell in: with <hi>Obadiah,</hi> you relieue the Prophets, and much more of this nature, which to set downe in order, would both spend much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and also a wearinesse to my hand: it is sufficient, God knowes them, and will one day reward the same. I speake not this to make you proud, but as my duetie to you, and to encourage others to the same. And so I will conclude with the saying of the: Apostle, yee haue, and doe well, yet I beseach you to increase more and more: whereby your name may bee more spread on earth, and your glory greater enlarged in heauen.</p>
