      <hi>WHEN the Philosopher spake soberly to the people,
<note place="margin">
            <hi>Laert. in vita Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>og. lib.</hi> 6.</note> they gave him no audience: but playing the Minstrell, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes flocked after him.</hi> Poets and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb facs="24"/>prophets have presumed to preach and prophecie of our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and we, like grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men, are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to reade them, and make merry with our owne miseries, and to laugh at our owne mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Wee are in just, and God is in good earnest, and in the end we shall know to our cost, what it is to trifle with God. God will
<pb facs="24"/>bend us or breake us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either he cease smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or wee smarting. <hi>Bee afflicted,
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.9, 10.</note> and mourne, and weep, let your laughter be turned into lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and your joy into heavinesse. Humble your selves in the sight of God, and he shall lift you up.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>J have laboured in this Treatise, to treade
<pb facs="25"/>out a way before you, and even from the Saints sufferings, and Sinners sorrowes, to giue you good counsell. Now is the time to glorifie God in suffering, and by the beginnings of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to shew our selves to be of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. My Text is a Briefe of judgements, both upon Gods house, and upon the haters of it; and gives the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb facs="25"/>of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end thereof. That judgement that begins with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fals heavily in the end upon their enemies.</p>
   <p>J may seeme in the middle of this Treatise to forsake my Text to seeke out the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: but J shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat my Reader for a favourable exposition of my minde and meaning. The Text toucheth the
<pb facs="26"/>sinne that ought to bee taught with all exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore J to helpe my Reader the better, have bent my strength the more to deale thorowly with it in all the branches. J shall easily render my account, and by that other Text, cleare my selfe of all unnecessary digressions, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table searches of such secrets as that place J
<pb facs="26"/>now mention, will allow me.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ioh. 16.7, 8.</hi> It is a truth that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is as expedient and necessary as his comming into the world. He came into the world to redeeme it, and hee leaves the world, that his Redemption may be preached and applyed. This application is the worke of the Spirit,
<pb facs="27"/>and by conviction is to be wrought upon the world. The things of which the world is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, are all Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, and essentially differ from things le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. First, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>to doe and live,</hi> the Gospel, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and live.</hi> The Law bids us looke <hi>to our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;</hi> The Gospel
<pb facs="27"/>
      <hi>to the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ.</hi> The Law does charge us <hi>with holinesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own righteousnesse.</hi> The Gospel, <hi>with holines according to the Spirit:</hi> Which being more exact, is the cause that it is so much spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at, and contemned by the world. Legall purity is not persecuted like Evangelicall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb facs="28"/>A man may bee a Pharisee, and favoured by the world: but a strict Christian is out of hope to farewell, even by the best worldlings. Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution hath waited more upon the Gospel, than the Law. The light of the one is farre too cleare for worldly eyes to behold it. Jt is strange with the world to deny it selfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in another. Jt is
<pb facs="28"/>hard to forsake a morall righteousnesse, and seek to be justified by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who can indure to have Satan so judged in him, as quite to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all Lawes, as to live by the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? This is a large difference of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Evangelicall commands: yet let them be accursed, that so farre set at oddes Law and Gospel, as either like
<pb facs="29"/>
      <hi>Iewes</hi> doe reject the Gospel to defend the Law, or like Familists renounce the Law to maintaine the Gospel. Love and no Law is the lewd learning of our new Gospellers. Duty, say they, is not worth the name of a Christian, that must doe all of meere love. Loose love that likes of nothing but free will offerings. Such licences are not granted
<pb facs="29"/>by Law or Gospel. They both agree in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our lives, and yeeld us liberty to obey, no licence to live as wee list: The Law will send us to Christ, and the Christian being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stied, will be sent backe againe by the Gospel, to walke unblameably by the Law.</p>
   <p>Legall comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow our workes, and curse us for our
<pb facs="30"/>deedes: but legall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations follow our saith, and where that is wanting, tell us wee are condemned, and as sure to goe to hell, as if wee were there already. Legall promises of life depend upon our merits, and tell us we shall bee rewarded for our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. But Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall promises depend upon our faith and Christs merit, and tels
<pb facs="30"/>us it shall be onely well with us in him. Sinnes wee have against the Law, and every booke intreats of them. Sinnes wee have against the Gospel, and it were well every Writer would in these dayes insist upon them. J have ventured farre into their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and wish all Christians by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in my Text, to take heed of
<pb facs="31"/>them. There is one thing will bee admired at, both for the Method and matter; how J come to speake so much; and in such a manner, of the glorious kingdome of the blessed Trinitie. My answer will be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, having granted me the Commentary for my Text. The holy Ghost comes in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ, and by applying his redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="31"/>administers first in the kingdome of God, taking possession of those subjects that God the Father hath chosen, and whom JESVS Christ hath redeemed by his precious blood. The Spirit workes for the Sonne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returnes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to him againe at his second comming. The Son works for the Father, and therefore so
<pb facs="32"/>takes the Kingdome from the Spirit, that in the end he gives it up to the Father for the full perfection of glory. This mutuall working sends me in my discourse from one person to another, and to all the world, to let them see what may be gained or lost, by obeying or disobeying the Gospell. I have wondred in reading the most ancient Fathers,
<pb facs="32"/>what they meant by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging so frequently men to Martyrdome, that they might not lose the honour of rising and reigning with Christ at his second appearing. Surely they saw and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that the Spirit of grace did not in vaine perswade them. They shall have honour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their hope, and as above others they gave their lives for

      <pb facs="34"/>Christ: so before others they seeme to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Rev 20.4.</hi> Let the meaning in that place be what it will, for J will not determine thereof: yet the age of the ten persecutions so conceived of it, as by plentifull testimonies might appeare. Jt is agreeable with Christs proceedings, to honour them that honour him, and as they are before
<pb facs="34"/>others in their zeale and service; so to be above others in their dignity and desert, though not of merite, and for their workes; yet according to his mercy and their workes. J could not well leave untouched, with the comming of the holy Ghost, upon Christs departure, the returne of him againe, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very up of all to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Family
<pb facs="35"/>and Houshold in my Text, might see their patience perfected in power, and their power consummated in glory. The Kingdome of God in the divers admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of it, will bee worthy the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Gods House shall bee most happy in their thoughts of it: All their enemies most miserable in the losse and deprivation
<pb facs="35"/>thereof. Their ends shall be augmented, in misery as many degrees as that Kingdome shall bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in glory. But J will stay my Reader no longer in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but wish him good successe in the substance of that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
