I thought it good to contemne it, as a famous libel, ful of lyes,<note place="margin">M. dormā in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> sclaunders, and blasphemies, and let it lye obscure with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, especially seing the superintendents, being demaunded, whether they would iustifie the saide booke, and all the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne contayned in it, haue geuen no signification nor notice of their liking, lest yf vpon their generall lyking, it shoulde be confuted, the ignominie should redounde vnto them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas nowe the whole shame lieth but in one pratīg Parrat,<note place="margin">Prouer. 26</note> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re woorthy to be contemned than answered.</p>
   <p>But when I considered that saying of Salomō, <hi>Answer a foole accordinge to his foolishnes that he may not seme wyse vnto him selfe,</hi> I thought it good to examine the forsaid answer, and discouer the folly of it, that bothe the authour seing his vanities layed before his eies, might be asshamed of his arrogancie, ād with the {pro}ude peacocke, lookīg vpō his foule feete, cast downe his braggīg tay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le ād abhorre his serpētine voyce, ād also the simple reader poy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soned with the venemo{us} drugges, of his gay coloured, ād sweete sugered wordes, might haue a remedy to expel that infectiō, ād preseruatyue to beware of the like. VVherfore al his superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cast aside, and impertinēts loted out, I will bringe the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and most principalst matters, that he treateth in his answer, to this examination. And that yow may the better vnderstand which are the wordes that M.

VVherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re God being a iealous God, a god that would haue the glorie of his name geuen to no creature on earthe, did forbid them, to make any grauen idol, or likenesse of any thinge, because they should not adore it,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> and worship it for God, as the children of Israel did, when they sayd of the golden Caulfe, <hi>Hi sunt dij tui Israell, These are thy Gods o Israell.</hi> Yf it had bene his holy will, to haue forbidden absolutely all kinde of images,<note place="margin">Exod 25. the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gells ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and set in the mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy seate by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntmēt of God. 3 Reg 7. Images of oxen and Lions in Salomons temple.</note> he would neuer haue willed Moyses to make the twoe Cherubins vpon the mercy seate, in the Tabernacle. For he should haue geuen a precept contrary to his firste commaūdement. Neither would Salomon being in hye fauour with God at that time, haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and engraued the images of oxen, lyons, and Cherubins in the tēple which he made, to the honour and glorie of God. For in so doing he should haue greuouslye transgressed that lawe. For the Cherubins that Moyses made, were <hi>scuptile,</hi> a grauen image, the images of a certayne order of Angells: the oxen and Lyons had <hi>Similitudinem,</hi> the likenesse of a thing in earth. But let vs not erre. There is no alteration, no chaunge, nor contradictiō in God: he is allwayes one. VVherfore when he did forbid the Israelites, to make any grauen image, he did forbidde them to make it, because they should not take them to be Gods, nor adore them and woorshippe them for Gods. VVhen he willed Moyses to make the tabernacle, he willed those Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubīs to be made,<note place="margin">Paralip. 22</note> for a bewtie and furniture of his house, which that precepte did not inhibite: which Salomon vnderstanding caused those oxen,<note place="margin">The ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves stam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars image in his coy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne.</note> Lyons, and Angells, to be engraued, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicted in his temple. And seing he making that temple by the prouidence and commaundement of God, willed those images to be made in his temple, it is euident that the forsaide comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undement of God, did not inhibite all kinde of images, to be made, no not in the temple.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>Besides this, the Iewes them selues, being very skillfull in their lawe, and scrupulouse in obseruing it, according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, stamped the image of Caesar in their coynes. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ seing it, did neuer reprehend them for it, which he woulde haue done, had it ben agaynst the lawe. But when he sawe the Coyne with the image of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he saide no more, but <hi>Geue vnto Caesar,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note>
      <hi>those thinges which are Caesars and to God those thinges that are Gods.</hi> Furdermore all Christian Emperours, princes, and gentle men would neuer haue engraued, nor sett in their ensig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and Armes, Egles, Lyons, Lylies, Greyhoundes, Draggons, Faukons, horses, gotes, bulls, beares, Apes, and such like. For <hi>scul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptile,</hi> is a grauen thing. And if all grauen thinges had ben by that precepte inhibited, they would neuer so generally haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, nor with out feare of Gods indignation, hitherto haue cōtynued it. Ouer and aboue al this, Christ gaue an image of his countenāce to <hi>Veronica,</hi> and sent an other to <hi>Abgarus,</hi>

The Christians euē frō the begynning payncted both his images and the Apostles also, which were <hi>sculptile &amp; similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> a grauē image, and the lykenes of a thinge. VVherfore seing Moyses at the commaundement of God, made the twoe Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins in the tabernacle, seing Salomon engraued in his tēple, oxen, lyons, and Cherubins, seing the Iewes stamped the image of Caesar in their Coynes, and were not reproued of Christ for them, seing Christen Emperours, princes, and gentle men sett Egles, Lyons, Lilies, dragons, greyhoundes, and such like in their armes, and were neuer controlled for yt, Seing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, euen from the Apostles tyme, haue made the images of Christ and his Apostles, and thoughte to honour Christ and his Apostles by it, yt must nedes followe, that the precepte of God,<note place="margin">VVhat i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages the L vve doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</note>
      <hi>Non facies tibi sculptile,</hi> Thow shalt not make vnto thy selfe any grauen image, doth not absolutely forbid all kinde of images, but only such as were adored and worshipped, and that not sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plye neither, but such as were adored ād worshipped for gods: such the lawe doth inhibite, such doth God forbid. And al such doe we Catholiques detest, accurse, and abhorre: and euer did.</p>
   <p>VVe knowe our images to be but the worke of man: we
<pb facs="9"/>
doe not worship, nor adore, nor honour the matter, wherof they are made. That which we adore and worship, is the thing represented by the image, which is either Christ him selfe, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of his saynctes. And in honouring them as the frendes of God, we honour God, as the prince that honoureth an others prince his Ambassadour honoureth the prince in his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.<note place="margin">Heretikes calling the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges Idols, or denie Christ to be come, or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the prophets. Sopho. 2. Al idols destroyed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> And if our newe Maisters will nedes haue the Christians images to be idolls, than either they must deny Christ with the Iewes to be come, or contemne the prophetts with the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes. For if Christ hath bē incarnate &amp; redemed the worlde, then hath he according to the predictions of the prophetts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all Idolls, and delyuered his church from them. For Sophonias said of Christ, <hi>He shall destroye all the godds of the earthe.</hi> Zacharie sayeth, <hi>I will destroy the names of Idolls out of the earthe, and they shalbe remembred no more.</hi> By the name of Idolls he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstādethe here honour and worship done to Idolls. Nowe yf Christ according to this prophecy, by his cumning destroyed all Idolls, and worshipps done vnto them, then will it followe, that the images of the Christians, are not Idolls, nor the honour and reuerence done vnto them, an honour and reuerence done vnto Idolls. Or yf it be, that either Christ by his cumming, did not destroye the idolls of the Gentils, or that the prophetts we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not true, in their {pro}phecies. And one of these twoe they must graunte, spite of their beardes, vnlesse they wilbe worse thā Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the apostata. For he being otherwise an enemy of Christe, and of all Christians seing the deameanour of the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauers,<note place="margin">Lib. 6 cōt. Iulia.</note> was forced to confesse that <hi>cessabant idola adorare, &amp; cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> as <hi>Cyrillus</hi> saieth: They ceased to adore and worship idols. But because he despited their religiō, and knewe not the secret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of it, he layde to their chardge, (as these men do to ours) that they adored the wood of the Crosse. But howe fondly it was done, Cyrill sheweth at lardge, as the learned knowe, and he that is desirous to see and able to reade and vnderstand, may turne the booke, and finde. For the simple, it may suffice them to knowe, howe that Christ, by his cumming destroyed al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked idolls, and grosse idolatrie of the Gentills, and taught vs a
<pb facs="9"/>
true waye to worship God in spirite and truth, and that, the catholique church, hath euermore obserued that manner of worshipping of God, and euer taught that images, be deuoyd of all sense of them selues, and therfore worthy of no honour in respecte of them selues, but in consideration that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto vs Christe, and his sainctes.</p>

<pb facs="10"/>
albeit God dwelleth not so in temples made with handes,<note place="margin">Acto. 15.28.</note> but that his power also is euery where without scripture, yet hath he bene worshipped, adored and honored in tēples made with handes. And as in the old Testament he commaunded the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to be made, and images of Cherubins in it, and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons temple, where both the Cherubins, and images of oxen liōs and such like were paynted: So hath he in the tyme of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, by secret inspirations, and visions, commaunded churches to be builded, that the faithfull might resort vnto them, to honour prayse, and serue hym. And in those he hath willed the signe of our redemption, and crosse of Christe and images of sainctes to be erected and set vp. And yf yow aske me where this will, and commaundement of God is to be seene, I answere, it is to be sene in the decrees of the catholique church which is one body with Christe, directed and taughte by the holy Ghoste. It is to be sene in the holy fathers, by whome God speaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs,<note place="margin">In Psal. 46</note> as S. Augustine declareth, saying: <hi>God hath spokē many wayes, he hath spoken by Angells, by prophetis, by his owne mouthe, by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, by his faithfull seruantes, he speaketh: by so meane a man as I am he speaketh, when I speake any thing that is true.

   <p>Furthermore albeit God hath forbidden vs to eate of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges offred to idolls, yet hath he not forbidden vs to eate that which is offred vpon the aulter.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> But prouided that he <hi>that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the aulter, shall take parte of the aulter.</hi> Or yf he had not, what reason hath this our protestants argument? <hi>VVe must not eate thinges offred to idolls, ergo we must haue no images?</hi> Consider it by a lyke. VVe must abstaine from fornication, ergo we must not haue the sounday kept holyday. As for the antecedent, it is a commaundemēt of God as well as the abstaining from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges offred to idolls, and the consequent followeth as well as the first. Concerning the thing it selfe, as the church, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God gaue a speciall precept to kepe holy the sabaoth day, aduētred to turne it into the sunday, because they woulde haue nothing common with the Iewes: So the same church, seing no

precepte of God forbidding the image of Christe and his Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, to be had amongest Christen men, hath not only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but also cōmaunded the said images, to be had in churches, and oratories. And seing it is so, we are as much bounde to obey the church in one, as in the other. To procede, what argument will he make, against images, of the wordes of S. Paule, either to the Romaines, Corinthians, or Galathians? Yf he say:<note place="margin">Rom, 1. 1. Cor. 5. Galat. 6. M. Calfs argumēts.</note>
      <hi>Some chaunged the glorie of the vncorruptible God into the likenes of an image, of a corruptible man, ergo all men did: we must not company with idolatours, ergo we must haue no images: we must flee from the woorshipping of Idolls: ergo we must worship no images, The temple of God hath no agrement with idolls, ergo the church hath no agrement with images: we must not be drunck with wyne, in which there is ryot, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go we must not haue any images of sainctes, Keepe your selfes, from counterfettes: ergo haue no images,</hi> VVe will send hym to schole to learne Logicke agayne: For this is starke naughte, as euery yoūge puine that hath read his first principles may see.</p>

      <hi>Therfore when Christ is paincted in his humaine nature, as the truth of the thing sheweth, Christen men professe and acknowledge that they shape the image that they see, to the first sampler according to the name, and not according to essence, or substance,</hi>

Yf when he lay wrapte in swadeling clothes in the manger, his diuinitie was enwrapped by the nature of his humanitie, then shall his diuinitie, that is vncircumscriptible, be circumscribed in a coloured image, but yf his diuinitie was not enwrapped there, in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, nor can his diuinitie be circumscribed here in the image.

      <note place="margin">The medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stiās vvhē they see the image of Christ.</note>
      <hi>and the angell and sheapeardes standing by, they thincke with them selues, that God is made man, and borne for our saluation. And that they acknowledg saying: He that is without fleshe, is nowe incarnate and borne in fleshe, he that is vnable to be touched, is nowe touched and felt. And so they acknowledge and confesse him to be one, perfecte in his humanitie and deitie. As for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Nestorius heresie.</note>
      <hi>he made two sonnes, vnum verbum patris, alterum Filium virginis. One the worde of the father, an other the sonne of the virgin. But true Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stians confesse Christ their lorde,</hi>
      <note place="margin">They do vvel that pay act the image of Christ.</note>
      <hi>and God, to be but one sonne. And when they paynte his image as he was incarnate and made mā, they are knownē to doe very well and godly. For God the sonne bing made man, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant with vs in fleeshe. The deitie is not cōsidered payncted: for no man euer sawe God. For he can not be paincted, sene, or comprised, but only his humanitie. For we knowe Christe to be of twoe natures, and in twoe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that is of humaine and diuine, ioyntly without diuision. One of them is vnable to be payncted, the other able to be payncted, is considered in one Christe.</hi>

      <hi>And the image is not like the first sampler according to his substā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, but only in respecte of name and disposition of lyneaments expressed by the partes of the bodie. For when a paynter, paynteth the image of a man, no man requireth or seeketh the soule in the image. And verily the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the soule of man, and the diuine nature is seuered. The diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is vncreated, and without all tyme. The soule of man is created, made in tyme, and framed by the diuine nature.</hi> Furder: <hi>No man that is wyse, seing the image of man, euer thought that the man was seuered from his soule by the paincter. For the image is not only depriued of the soule, but of the substāce of the bodie, as fleeshe, musculles, synowes, bones, bloud, fleame, choler, and humours, the mixture wherof can not be sene in the image.

      <note place="margin">Fol 15. b They are not liere nor idolaters that call the image made to represent christ, the image of Christ.</note>

The honour and worship which the churche alloweth to images, is no other, but a reuerent putting of the cap, bowing, kneeling, kissing, or such like, which, seing it hath bene done, and may be done to creatures, we are no more idolaters, for vsing the like to any image, than you are for kneeling to the prince, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of yower cap to the cloth of estate, for kissing the Quenes seale, or bowing to yower frend when you meete him.</p>

For the making of an image, is the worke of mās hand, and by such worke Christ can not be made inferiour to his father. VVhen Christ walked here on earth, the disciples honoured him, and wayted vpō him, and serued him as man, his mother attended vpon him, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and other holy woemen followed him as man. <hi>Mathaeus</hi> and <hi>Zachaeus</hi> receaued him into their houses as mā: and because they did serue him, honour him, and followe him as man, did they therfore deny him to be God? and make him inferiour to the father, or cleaue only to his humanitie? No sir: In like manner when we payncte him as man, engraue his image as man, or portraicte him vpon the crosse crucified as man, doe we deny him to be God, or make him inferiour, to the father or cleaue only to his humanitie? VVhat extreame folly is in this follishe fantasie?<note place="margin">A questiō to M. Calf.</note> Let me aske M. Calf. this question. VVhen you made and penned yower last sermō, did you write the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste in it or no?

An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swer M. Calf. And yf you by writing his name in yncke and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="15"/>
do not deny him to be God, nor make him inferiour to his father, no cleaue only to his humanitie, no more doe we by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his image in colours, or in any kīde of metal. But as you by writīg his name in yncke, ād paper, doe by reading or pronoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it trāsmitte him by the eare into the minde, and there cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue him to be bothe God ad mā: Euē so we by payncting him as man, doe by the eie transmitte him into the hearte, and there adore and worship hym as God, and mā, of equal substāce with the father, and neuer separate his diuine and humaine nature.</p>
   <p>But put case in paynting Christ as man, we did make hym in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the father? Are we therefor idolaters M. Calf? Did not Christ say, <hi>Pater maior me est?</hi> My father is greter than I am? Doth not the Catholique church sing in the crede made by <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioan. 14.</note>
      <hi>Minor patre secundum humanitatem?</hi>
      <note place="margin">In Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasij.</note> Christ is lesser than the father according to his humanitie? And if Christ be inferiour to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was man, is it not lawfull for vs to thincke so of him? And if it be lawfull to thincke so of him, is it not laufull to paynte him so, and set hym foorth in a picture as man and yet committe no idolatrie? Answer directly sir. Vnlesse you quitte your self the better, either yow must recant with greate shame, or denie the gospel of Christ, and doctrine of the church with impudent arrogancie. For they manifestly teache that Christ according to his humanitie is inferiour to his father. And that being true, it is no idolatrie nor to thincke hym nor make hym in that sense inferiour to his father.</p>
   <p>Thus for that obiection, wherin yf I haue bene somewhat longe, pardon me (gentle reader). It is all to make the matter playne to thy capacitie. Yf I had to doe with M. Calf. alone in the schooles, I would haue denied his argument, and required his ministershippe to haue made these consequēts good. <hi>Christ is God, and man, ergo there can be no image made of hym as man. There can be no image of the godhead, ergo there can be true image of Christ, as man, ergo they that honour it, are me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re idolatours, making Christe therby inferiour to his father, and cleauing only to his humanitie.</hi> And when he had iustified
<pb facs="16"/>
them by scripture, councell, or auncient father, or any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I would haue geuen him the victorie, and so will I yet, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I cōuince and impugne his reason with better. In the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tyme we will beleaue the ordinaunces of the Catholique church, and boldly affirme that as man consisting of body and soule,<note place="margin">An image of man may be paynted although the soule cā not be expressed. Fol. 16. a</note> may be payncted, albeit the soule which is the chifest part can by no arte be expressed: Euen so our Sauiour Christ may be paynted, engraued, and represented by an image in the forme and shape of man, albeit the diuinitie which is the cheifest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te be vncircumscriptible, indiuisible, incomprehēsible and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any meanes to be expressed. But the reason is nothing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, quoth M. Calf. <hi>For the soule may be seuered from the bodye as daily by death we see by experience. Nor is it impietie to thincke vpon, or behold the shape of a man without a soule, but the diuinity of Christ can not be separated from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitye. Nether is it lawfull to imagine an humanitye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diuinitie lest we fall into the heresy of Nestorius.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that he varieth farre from all good reason, aske him first (good readers) whether our sauiour Christ died not for vs, as man, and whether he gaue not vp the ghost, and lay in the gaue as mā?<note place="margin">The soule of Christ seuered from his bodie at his death.</note> and if he cōfesse it, (as he must) yf he be a Christen man, then aske him whether the soule of Christ was not seuered at that tyme from the bodie, and yf he acknowledge it, then aske him whether it be impietie for vs to thincke that the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of Christ was seuered from his body? Yf he accompte it none, then must he seeke for a newe reason to proue, that albeit man consisting of body and soule may paynted, yet Christ consisting of his humane and diuine nature, can not be paynted as man, for this will not serue.</p>
   <p>Agayne whereas we talke of paynting, aske him why he chaungeth the state of question,<note place="margin">M Calf fleeth frō the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> and runneth to <hi>thinckīge,</hi> and where we speake of engrauing, why doth he runne to ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and from the hande why doth he flee to the heart? ower cōtrouersie is not whether the minde may thincke, or the heart imagine the humanitye of Christ, without the diuinitye, but
<pb facs="16"/>
whether the hand may paynte him, as man, not withstanding it is not able to paynt his diuinitie. And to this he sayeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, worthy the hearing, nor can yf he would. For looke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we lawful it is for him to haue his wiues image or coūterfeicte of his frende, in his house: So lawfull it is for vs, to haue the ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge of our sauiour Christ in the shape of mā, both in the church and house. Nor doe we Christen men,<note place="margin">Christen mē neuer separate the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Christ frō his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> when we behold that image separate in hearte and thoughte, the diuinitie, from the humanitie, nor thincke of Christ as only man, but we beleaue him, we acknowledg him, we confesse him to be God and man, equall with his father in substāce, and euerlasting in diuyne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie with him. This with heart we beleaue, and this with mou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the we confesse, and worship him in spirite, and truthe, whome we knowe to be re{pre}sented by that image. Nor was there euer Christen man, allowed of the church, that thoughte contrary. VVherfore M. Calf. may seeke other, whome he may vpbraide with the heresie <hi>Nestorius,</hi> for paynting the image of Christe as man. For that sclaunder can not light vpon the Catholiques.</p>
   <p>His other twoe reasons that followe are witlesse.<note place="margin">Fol. 16 a M.

Agayne vnknowne it is what was the forme and countenaunce of Christ. Therfore as sone as an image of Christ is paīted by and by a lye is made?</hi> I assure you no simple logisoner,<note place="margin">The pro{per}<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the original not to be sought in an image.

It is but paultry. For it is not necessarie (as I said before out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) that the image be like the originall, and first sampler in substance: nor any man that wise is, will seeke the properties of the originall, in the image. For true reason see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kethe nothing in an image, but the communitie of the name, and disposition of lyneamentes expressed by the partes of the bodie. Yf it should haue all the {pro}perties and qualities of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, then should it be no image, but the thinge it self. As if the
<pb facs="17"/>
picture which the payncter draweth, should haue fleash, bloud musculls, synowes, life and other properties, and qualities that rest in the originall, we would no longer accompte it an image but a man. VVherefor we tell M. Calf. that in this case he is lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely deceaued, and that vnlesse he proue by scriptures, councels and fathers, that all the properties of Christe and his blessed fleashe, must be expressed in his image, he shalbe a lyer for saying, <hi>It is a lying image, and not the image of Christ.</hi>

They haue no sacrament, no baptisme, no supper of our lorde, nor gospell, nor Christ. And because they haue none, shall we haue none? what a sleight of Sathan is this?

The Iewes and Turkes do not beleaue that the <hi>Messias</hi> is come, <hi>ergo</hi> the Christians should

not. The Iewes and Turkes haue no baptisme, <hi>ergo</hi> the Christiās should haue none. The Iewes and Turkes haue no Sacraments <hi>ergo</hi> the Christians should haue none. The Iewes keepe not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sundaye, <hi>ergo</hi> the Christians should not. The Iewes and Turkes haue no Gospell nor Christe, <hi>ergo</hi> the Christians should haue nor Gospell nor Christe. By like reason as M.

   <p>VVherfor I much maruell that M. Calf. would vse that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Iewes, and alleadge that of the Turkes. It conuinceth him of inexcusable follye, and declareth that he, ād his fellowe protestantes, in this poynt resemble the Iewes and Turkes, as nigh as can be. For as the Iewes and Turkes detested and abhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red images,<note place="margin">Heretikes resemble the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves and Turkes.</note> so do they. As the Iewes and turkes counted images to be idolls, so do they. As the Iewes and Turkes called the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians idolaters, for hauing and worshipping of images, so doe they. As the Iewes and Turkes thincke it laufull to put away their wyues in case of fornicatiō, and marry another. So would M. Calf. and the protestātes haue it laufull for them. The Iewes and Turkes marry according to Moyses lawe in the degrees of affinitie.<note place="margin">Melanch. in locis com 52.</note> So M.

The Iewes and Turkes haue their Canon of scripture,<note place="margin">Melanch.

The Iewes and Turkes doe no penaunce, nor vse any confession of their synnes, no more doth M. Calf. nor his. The Iewes and Turkes detest the crosse as a signe of maledictiō. M.

      <hi>Amadys lying at the poynt of death, when mens witts and senses commonly faile them, was not put in remembrance of Christe by the crosse presented vnto him by his person, ergo men that are whole, and in no such extremitie, can not be put in remembrance by it.</hi> And yf this be not, in the iudgement of some whote protestant, a doltishe kinde of reasoning, let him consider it by the like. Some that are almost dead in the lewde lustes of synne, take no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie by the worde of God preached by their person: <hi>Ergo</hi> no man doth. The scholler who hath neither witte nor capacitie, taketh no profitte by his maisters lessons. Ergo none of the rest can.
