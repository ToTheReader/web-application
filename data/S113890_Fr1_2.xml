   </head>
   <p>RIght Worshipfull Sir, though the kingdome of Ireland did bereaue his countrey of yours, of a great part of that good, which by a certain right it hoped for from you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by reason of your long seruice there vnder Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> of blessed memorie, in the chiefest and most honourable seate of Iustice, by the space of <hi>15.</hi> or <hi>16.</hi> yeares together: yet the benefite vnto both the Kingdomes was thought to be so great thereby, that the losse was so much the more easily borne.</p>
   <p>And now at the last this countrey doth willingly acknowledge, that it hath great
<pb facs="3"/> cause to thanke God, not onely for your safe returne vnto it some years past, furnished with greater experience for gouernment; but also with hope of neuer departing frō them any more: sauing that in your last imployment, vnder his Highnes (whome God long preserue) into his Ilands of <hi>Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> and <hi>Garnesie,</hi> they were suspended frō that hope by the space of certaine moneths.</p>
   <p>Which beeing faithfully performed and ended, their hope is renued, that you bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now at the last, <hi>merito tuo maximo donatus rude,</hi> may say of this countrey <hi>Here is my rest.</hi> Which my selfe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </note> with hope to <hi>appeare before God in Syon;</hi> that you haue incouraged many vnto the like paines, and haue left the slothfull without excuse. By which, &amp; some other good examples like this, the credit of Gods word among vs hath in some to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable sort beene hetherto vpheld.</p>
   <p>For which, and for many other great fauours from you both, I present these small fruits of my poore labours vnto you, as a perpetuall testimonie of my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes vnto you; and to God for you. Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to multiplie his graces vpon you, and long to preserue you to your owne mutuall comfort, and the good of so many, as doe depend vpon you.</p>
   <p>And the like blessing of God be vpon the good and forward hopes of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull <hi>M. William Spring</hi> your onely child; that his youth may be still so seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="4"/> with religion and learning, that in time to come he may in the seate of Iustice for the good of his countrey, by his deserts goe beyond all his progenitors: and so long vphold the credit of that right worshipfull house. And so I most humbly take my leaue of you all. <hi>Norton in Suff. Iun. 24. 1608.</hi>
