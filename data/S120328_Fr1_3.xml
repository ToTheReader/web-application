   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Learned and holy man of this age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the odour of his Sanctity, hath left suruiuing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Monuments of his writing; and, amongst the rest, three bookes <hi>Of the Imitation of Christ our Lord.</hi> In the first of these, he sheweth, vnder seuerall Titles, the seuerall Offices which his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty is performing to the soules of men; as he is our <hi>God;</hi> our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> our
<hi>King;</hi> our <hi>Sauiour;</hi> our <hi>Mediatour;</hi>
      <pb n="10" facs="6"/>our <hi>Aduocate;</hi> our <hi>Captaine;</hi> our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> our <hi>Spouse;</hi> our <hi>Doctour;</hi> our <hi>Law-giuer;</hi> our
<hi>Pastour;</hi> our <hi>Light;</hi> our <hi>Life;</hi> &amp;, to conclude, our <hi>Iudge.</hi> The whole booke is large, and not only should I haue felt the paines in translating it all, but I might haue doubted of your Patience, whether or no it would haue reached, to the reading of it ouer, with due intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The last of the <hi>Tytles,</hi> deliuered to vs by our Authour, I haue heere translated; and you may see, that he is a Lyon by his nayles.</p>
   <p>In this discourse of <hi>Iudge,</hi> which is not founded vpon priuate contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, and much lesse, either vpon loose coniections, or streyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts; but euen wholy in effect, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the passages of holy Scriptures (though not cyted word for word, but duely pondered, and truly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrased, as the best spirituall wryters are wont to do) he doth admirably<pb n="11" facs="6"/>describe the soueraigne Maiesty, the incomparable Mercy, and the inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Iustice of our <hi>Iudge.</hi> And (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident heerunto) he deliuers vs such a Mappe of the next world; and doth so describe the <hi>Paradise</hi> of heauen, &amp; the <hi>Zona Torrida</hi> of hell, as may serue, either to rauish vs with ioy, or strike vs through with horrour, and make vs euen wither, for woe; according to the seueral state that we may be in. If we be members of the true Church of Christ our Lord; and if, withall, we be in the state of grace, we shall looke with more hope vpon the ioyes of heauen, then with feare, vpon the torments of hell; and so, we shall get courage in the good course begun. But if, on the other side, we be cut off from the communion of the true Church of Christ our Lord, by any one errour in beliefe; or if yet, being Catholikes, we be remaining in state of mortal sinne, this Treatise, I hope,<pb n="12" facs="7"/>wil help to guide vs by the hād out of those Labyrinths; &amp; place vs in that high way of Fayth &amp; Charity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we can haue no tytle to heauē; but the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aws of hel, will be sure to sucke, &amp; swallow, &amp; deuoure vs.</p>
   <p>Let no man therfore be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or rather let no man deceaue himselfe. God is God, and he wilbe serued. And it is all reason, that, by our beleeuing, and liuing as we ought, true Homage may be done to that infinite, inuisible, immortall, and most pure Maiesty of his. And man is man; a thing of nothing, for of nothing he was made. And as now he is, what is he, but a Pedlars-shop full of trash; or rather a very sincke full of filth; and to what height of honour ought he esteeme himselfe to be aduanced, if he had but euen a single leaue, to serue &amp; loue such an omnipotent Creator? But now, since besides this, he is to be rewarded
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>with an immortall Crowne of glory for so doing (the sublime excellency wherof, no created power can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend) what meruayle can it be, that the torments be also infinite, to which he shalbe adiudged and chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if insteed of doing reuerence to God, by imbracing an incorrupted faith, &amp; leading either an innocent, or penitent life, he enter into rebelliō and treason against him, by imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any errour in beleefe, or falling into sensuality, or any one other mortall sin, if withall, he dye therin, without repentance.</p>
   <p>It is not want of Charity, in them who say, That all such as dye with any mortall sinne vpon their soules shall eternally be tormented in the fyre of hell; but it is true Charity to declare this truth, that so, in tyme men may know to what to trust. <hi>S. Paul</hi> abounded, and ouerflowed with <hi>Charity;</hi> and that very <hi>Charity</hi> it
<pb n="14" facs="8"/>was, which obliged him to proclaim this doctrine;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</note> That, <hi>the workes of the flesh be manifest,</hi> and he saith they are these,
<hi>Fornication, Vncleanes, Impudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Luxury, Seruing of Idolls, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, Emnities, Contentions, Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Angers, Brawles, Dissentions, Sects, Enuies, Murthers, Ebrieties, Commessations, and such like. Of these</hi> (saith he) <hi>I foretell you, as I haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told you, that they which do such things as these, shall not obtaine the kingdome of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now if these Sinnes doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude men from heauen, others also which are as grieuous, wilbe as sure to exclude them; and the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will they exclude them, the more grieuous, and enormous they fall out to be. For if simple fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe make a soule lyable to the paines of hell, what will not Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do? If for a priuate emnity with a mans neighbour, he shalbe adiudged<pb n="15" facs="8"/>to those eternall and vnquenchable flames, what shall be not be, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the Church of Christ our Lord, by vnbeleeuing any doctrine, or disobeying the gouernement ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
   <p>I say the vnbeleeuing of any doctrine, as before I said of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any other mortall sinne. For this is as true, in the law of our faith, as it is, in the law of our life, That, <hi>Qui in vno peccat omniū factus est reus; he that offends in one, is made guilty of all.</hi> Not that he who offends in all, shall not be more deepely damned, then he that doth it but in one; but because whosoeuer shall haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mortally against any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of our Lord God, which concerneth good life, or any errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine, in difference from the Catholike beliefe, is most truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a breaker of the Law of God, and a corruptour of his truth;
<pb n="16" facs="9"/>and that as such a one, he shall perish, except he repent. Woe be therefore to them (and of woe they will be one day sure) who bringe such false weights into the world; and who prophane the law of God, and not onely the law, but the law-giuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; In that they allow him not to be a perfect hater, and a seuere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of all mortall sinne, in what soule soeuer it be found. Whereas yet he protesteth himselfe (throughout the whole Current of holy Scripture) not onely to hate, but to abhorre it. <hi>The</hi>
      <note n="1" place="margin">
         <hi>Sap.</hi> 14.10.</note>
      <hi>impious man, and his impiety are hated by Almighty God. The</hi>

      <hi>scoffer, the</hi>

         <hi>Prou.</hi> 16.5.</note>
      <hi>Arrogant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is an abomination to God. The</hi>
      <note n="5" place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.9.</note>
      <hi>way of the wicked man, and euery wicked thought of man, is abhorred of God. Thou</hi>
      <note n="6" place="margin">
         <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.8.</note>
      <hi>wicked man, thou shalt dye the death. Behould</hi>

         <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23.19.</note>
      <hi>the whirlewind of the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God shall go forth (sayth the Lord of Hosts) and it shall come vpon the<pb n="17" facs="9"/>head of sinners, like a furious tempest.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, if any man perhaps shall tell me, that these places, &amp; the like, are only meant of Infidels, or such other wicked men, as shall haue spent their whole life in the offence of God; but that christiās &amp; such as lead not a life so prophanly wicked as those others, are not meant heereby, howsoeuer they may commit some mortal sinne, and continue therein; let such a one behould, how the holy Ghost taketh care to answere his obiection, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring vs,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.26.</note> That, <hi>If a man, who had been neuer so iust, should yet forsake that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice by committing sinne, he should dye therein.</hi> And then he can looke for nothing, but that
<hi>Day,</hi> whereof ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet sayth:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Mal.</hi>
4.1.</note>
      <hi>That it shall come burning, like a fornace, where all proud men, and all other persons working wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, should be like stubble, and that this day, shall set them on fire.</hi> Nay it is a feareful thing to see, in the Prophet <pb n="18" facs="10"/>
      <hi>Ieremy,</hi> how our Lord doth sweare, That how full of priuiledge soeuer, &amp; how deare soeuer a man may haue beene to him, yet if he fall to sinne, &amp; dye therein, he will reiect him. For speaking of a sinner he expresseth it, in these wordes of Terrour:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ierem.</hi> 22.24.</note>
      <hi>As I liue</hi> (sayth our Lord) <hi>if Iechonias the sonne of Ioachim the king of Iuda, were a ring, which I did weare vpon myne owne right hand, I would plucke it off.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So deadly doth Almighty God hate sinne, and sinners; and so infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly will he iudge them to be tormē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the same, in those eternall ardours of hell, if they repent not cordially thereof before their death. And what a fit of phrensy then, must that be, which can possesse vs so far, as to make vs, for any temporal and base delight, to forsake, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne by that God of eternall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and of infinite beauty.</p>
   <p>But in the selfe same manner,<pb n="19" facs="10"/>the Fathers and Doctours of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, haue testifyed this truth vpon all occasions. They were not Infidells, but faythfull Christians to whome
<hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> sayd<note place="margin">
         <hi>Hom.</hi> 22. <hi>ad pop. Antioch. tom.</hi> 5.</note> (when withall, he tooke himselfe into the number:) <hi>Consider that without fayle, we must all departe, to stand before that Iudge, whome it will not be possible for vs to de eaue; and where, not only our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shallbe iudged, but euen our very wordes, and thoughts; and where we shal endure extreme punishment for those things, which heer haue seemed but smal. Be alwayes remembring these thinges; &amp; see thou neuer forget that fire which is neuer to be extinguished. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (sayth S. Ambrose)<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ambr. in psal</hi> 38.</note>
      <hi>lament our sinnes that we may deserue pardon. If our sinnes be not forgiuen in this life we shal haue no rest in the next. The</hi>

<hi>tom.</hi> 4.</note>
      <hi>burning of such as shal be damned, wilbe eternall, as the fire is to be which shal burne them: and Truth affirmeth, that not they only<pb n="20" facs="11"/>are to be sent vnto it who wanted Fayth, but they also who wanted good workes.</hi> This last is sayd by <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and he also affirmeth thus in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: <hi>No one good deed is left vnrewarded, nor no one sinne vnpunished. At the last Day</hi> (sayth
<note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>Greg. l.</hi> 9.
<hi>Moral.</hi>
      </note> S. Gregory) <hi>that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring flame shal burne such as are now polluted with carnall pleasures; then shall the infinitely wide mouth of hell, swallow downe such persons, as heere are puffed vp with pride. And they, who through their fault haue heer performed the wil of their crafty Tempter, shall fall like reprobates into those torments, togeather with that guide of theirs. And</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>Greg. l.</hi> 5.
<hi>Moral.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>according to the quality of their sinne, the punishment thereof shallbe ordayned, and euery dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned soule shallbe tormented in the fire of hell, after the rate of her demerit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is then the verdict of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Saints of the holy Catholik Church, and of the Apostle Saint Paul; yea and so the holy Ghost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe<pb n="21" facs="11"/>who wrote by his penne, and which is euery where cleerly giuen, to proue this certaine truth, That <hi>any one mortall sinne, whether it might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst good life, or true beliefe,</hi> doth shut vp the gates of heauen against vs, &amp; set open the bottomlesse Abysse of hell to swallow vs, vnlesse we repent thereof sincerely, before our death.</p>
   <p>The hower of which death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so wholy hidden from vs, it will infinitely concerne vs, both instantly and exactly, to cast vp all the accōpts of our Conscience; to be cordially sorry for all our sinns; to confesse them distinctly; to purpose an amendment firmely; and to satisfy for them intierly. For this is a busines which must not be dispatcht after a cursory and superficiall manner; but we are to consider with what care we would consult about our estats, if they were in danger; or about our liues, if they lay on bleeding. And<pb n="22" facs="12"/>heer we must not faile to vse so much more deligēce then there, as <hi>Eternity</hi> is of more importance, then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tyme.</hi> And in fine, we are to do it so, as, at the hower of our death, (when we shall go to stand before our <hi>Iudge</hi>) we would be glad that we had done it. For without this true repentance which signifieth a flight from sinne with griefe; and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a flight towards God with loue, it is no Faith in Christ our Lord, which will serue the turne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vs out of that lake of eternall torment. But rather, the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we shall haue had of him by <hi>Faith,</hi> the greater will our torment be, if we do not pēnance for the sinns which we shal haue cōmitted against that Maiesty of his Which, the same <hi>Fayth</hi> telleth vs to be infinite; and that his hatred against sinne is also infinite; and that as, with strange mercy, he will assume to incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
<pb n="23" facs="12"/>immortall ioy, the soule, which at that day he shall find to be free from sinne; so in whomsoeuer he he shall perceaue, that sin remaines, the same soule will he then instantly adiudg to that sea of fire &amp; brimston, where it will saile in sorrow, &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and rage, for all eternity.</p>
   <p>To the pretious <hi>Death,</hi> &amp; <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ our Lord, we owe &amp; must acknowledg (amongst innumerable others) this vnspeakeable benefit (for which let all the Angells for euer blesse &amp; praise his holy name), That through the infinite merit therof, we may be receiued to grace, by meanes of true contrition and pēnance; how often, and how wickedly soeuer, we shall haue offēded that high Maiesty. But that <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Passion,</hi> will neuer saue the soule of any one creature, vnlesse both that mystery, and all the other mysteries of Catholike faith, be well beleeued, &amp; al sinne be cordially<pb n="24" facs="13"/>detested; which sinne, is a monster, so fierce and cruell, as that it did cost the very sonne of God his life. By that life, and by that death I begge, that thou wilt giue ouer to trample with thy durty feete, in the sacred Bloud Royall of our B. Sauiour, which he shed for thee vpon the Crosse. For so thou dost, preferring
<hi>Barabbas</hi> before him, as often as thou cōmittest any mortall sinne; and so long thou hast continued to doe it, as thy soule hath beene spotted with that crime.</p>
   <p>Or if thou haue so little of the noble in thee, as to be moued more by thine owne interest, then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that immense benefit, which the foūtain of Maiesty vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed, with such excesse of loue, to this wicked creature man; then, do I coniure thee, euen by that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of thine owne, that instantly thou make hast into thy selfe; and that, discharging thy soule by pēnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,<pb n="25" facs="13"/>of whatsoeuer may be offensiue to the pure eyes of God, thou implore his mercy now, which may saue thee from that inflexible iustice of his, in the last dreadful day. At which tyme, euen this very paper will appeare to thy extreme, and euerlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, if thou forbeare to serue thy selfe of this admonition.<hi>Heauen and earth shall passe away, but the word of God shall remayne for euer.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 30.</note> And that word hath thus aduised vs, and thus assured vs by the mouth of the most B. Apostle S. Paul, speaking to the Galathiās:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gal.</hi>
6.7.</note>
      <hi>Nolite errare, Deus non irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur: Quae enim seminauerit homo, haec &amp; metet. Quoniam qui seminat in carne sua, de carne &amp; metet corruptionem; qui autem seminat in spiritu, de spiritu metet vitam aeternam.</hi> The plaine and cleere sense whereof, is as followeth:
<hi>Take heed you frame not certaine fantasticall, and false opinions to your selues, as if you could ouer-reach Almighty God, &amp; eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
<pb n="26" facs="14"/>his truth, &amp; make him belieue that he gaue you a free law wherby to liue, thē indeed he gaue. But be well assured that the very truth is this: Let euery man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, consider seriously what he sowes, for iust so, and no otherwise, shall he reape. If you sow works of flesh</hi> (which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly cited before, in this Preface, out of a former Chapter of S. Paul to the same <hi>Galathians</hi>) <hi>yow shall reape nothing but corruption, but destruction, but euerlasting damnation. But if yow sowe workes of the spirit, which are wholy contrary to those others, and are there expressed to be Charity, Ioy, Peace, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Benignity, Goodnes, Longanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Meekenes, Fayth, Modesty, Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency &amp;, Chastity, yow shall in vertue of that spirit (wherewith you liue, and whereby you are to walk) passe on from this transitory to an eternall life; &amp; then at the most liberal hands of God you shal receaue a most precious crowne of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall glory.</hi>
