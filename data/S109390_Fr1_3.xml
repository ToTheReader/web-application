   <head>❧ <hi>A playne Treatise to</hi> learne in a short space the Frenche tongue (.?.)</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two and tvven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie letters in the French tongue, the which wee will expounde after the order of the crosse row, hauing first made to be vnderstanded how they ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced euery one by it selfe, then ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with others in any woorde: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvardes, vvhen they doe keepe theyr sounde, and vvhen they doe lose it, or chaunge it, for herein consisteth all the difficultie of the tongue, my respect in this vvorke is to straungers and specially to Englishe men, for vvhome I vvrite, vvhich marueyle (&amp; not vvithout cause) for that often times vve doe not sounde our letters, according to their ovvne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but doe chaunge them into an other
<pb facs="5"/>
sounde, and sometime vve doe not onely so alter them, but leaue them vnsounded euen as if they vvere not vvritten. First therefore they must presuppose that it is the nature of the tongue as of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and also of their ovvne, and they maye not denie it, for experience doth shevv it, I vvill not say in some vvordes but almost in all, and yet they can yelde no other reason for it, than vse. But I do hope in this my Treatise to do more cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our tongue, not for to prayse or extoll it, but to ondeuour to satisfie them, that are so desirous to learne it, and to stirre them vp the rather so to doe, for that hereby my minde is (vvith the grace of God) to teach them: and I vvill yelde them a reason, vvhy this letter here is sounded and that letter there is not, and vvhy a letter is pronounced in one place, and not in another, &amp; also by vvhat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son this letter here is rather sounded vvith that letter there, then vvith another, and to conclude I vvil omitte nothing (if I
<pb facs="5"/>
can) that may be profitable &amp; necessarie for Englishmen to knovv forthvvith, to reade vvell, to pronounce, and speake Frenche. For I vvill applie my selfe to them and to resolue the doubts that they may mooue, vvherof oftentimes I haue reasoned vvyth certayne, vvhome I dyd so ansvvere, that for the most part I contented them: in so much that already knovving some part of their mind of this matter, it vvill bee the easier for me to make them vnderstand it, cōferring here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their tongue vvith ours, and giuing them examples thereof, for thereby the matter shall be vnto them more &amp; more manifested, vvhich being done, I shall thinke thereinto haue much eased many that vvere so loden vvith difficulties and doubts (that they did see in our Frenche Grammars, that they vvere constrayned to gyue ouer and leaue all▪ yea, seeing them selues deceyued by their Teachers, vvho promised vnto them mountaynes of golde, and made them beleeue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

tongue vvas so obscure as none coulde be more, but vvith the labour and industrie, that they shoulde take, they vvould make it easie for them: and all this came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet to a very great thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the harme and tediousnesse that the learners receyued thereof. Likevvyse I trust I shal againe encourage those that vvere in the vvay to learne it, the vvhich I vvishe vvith all my hart: For I desire nothing else in this vvorlde, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and furtherance of euery one, and the rather bycause it is a deede of charitie, of the vvhich the Heathen also haue had some naturall instinct, as may be seene by their bookes, that they haue left vnto vs in vvriting, vvhere they all crie vvith one accorde, that vve are not onely borne for our selues, but for our Parents, for our Countrey, and for all those that doe vs good, &amp; that shevv themselues charitable vnto vs. Novv of devvtie I ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure the profit of them of this Countrey, for the great benefits that vve doe receyue
<pb facs="6"/>
of them, &amp; let no man thinke that I do set forth this for any other occasiō, that is to saye; for lucre or any other vayne thing, for he should be much deceaued, &amp; also I vvoulde accuse him of the same vice. For euen as he that hath his mouth out of taste, thinketh that euery thing that he eateth is also euill sauouring and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euen so it is of those that delight to reprehēde other, vvhich they neuer could doe except they vvere stuffed and defiled, yea rotten vvith vices, vvhich they vvolde cast (if they coulde) vpon others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray thē to leaue of such fopperies, for so they may be called, and let them bestovve their tyme in goodnesse, if they vvill that men esteeme of them, as they vvoulde be esteemed of. As touching the rest, if their peruerse nature vvill needs be occupyed in such their biting actions, the truth wil byte thē so hard, that their good name shall first feele the same and vvill make them to be cut vvith their ovvne svvorde. For that vvhich mooued me to
<pb facs="7"/>
take this matter in hande, vvas the great loue and affection that I beare to English men, and also the request of many Lords and Gentelmen, vvyth vvhome I haue spent much tyme, being conuersant and communicating vvith them, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciatiō of our tongue, so that I durst not say them naye, although I haue not beene much trayned vp in theyr tongue. But they haue promysed me, that if I doubted of any vvorde, touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of their tongue vvith ours, or in this translation, that they vvoulde ayde me. So that resting vpon this their aide, and fauour, I dyd not then doubt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise this little Treatise. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our tongue, if I doe not obserue all thinges as I shoulde, neyther yet content the students, as I vvould the blame must not be layde on me, seeing that not I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but all those that haue vvritten of it, haue not comprehended the forth part of our tongue in rules or precepts: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding that vvhich I coulde not
<pb facs="7"/>
doe, as I vvoulde, I haue recompenced by labour as you shall see hereafter in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I keepe, as vvell in the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of euery letter, as in the knovvledge of vvoordes, to vveete, of vvhat part of speache they are. But afore vve come to the vnderstanding of the vvoordes, vvee must speake of the letters, of vvhich the vvoordes are formed: to the end that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the nature of the simple, vve may more easily come to the compoundes, as frō letters, to syllables, &amp; from syllables, to vvoordes, and from vvordes to spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Therefore vvilling to expounde first the letters, vve must of nature and reason begin at, <hi>A,</hi> for it is the first in order, and for to see the same cleerely I vvill vvrite all our tvvo &amp; tvventie letters in this maner</p>
