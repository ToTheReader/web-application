leading me (as it were) in an aspiring ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacion, to bring forth somewhat worthy your honorable view &amp; protectiō: wherin hauing as yet nothing of mine own to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent your honor withal, it may like you (in the meane while) to receiue this short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the third and late French troubles, the same as they were lately writtē by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent eye witnes, assisting all their actuall procedings vntill Ianuary last: so, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

of God) to wise writings on earth, a true history may iustly chalenge a first place, being (in dede) no small parcel of the same sacred word it selfe. If we also discend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Philosophy, History is her chiefest part in what degree so euer wise men wil place her, which <hi>Plato</hi> forgets not to affirme in reckening such cities and people very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whose princes and soueraigne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours be Philosophers, as though no parte of Philosophy did more liuely and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally instruct a vertuous lyfe, thā histories, who as with a certaine harmonie &amp; swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to draw men to good by ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

which, in teaching vs the chiefe and hygh truthe, willes vs also to bee lesse negligent of our own estimation, than (in swaruing from that which is honest and true) eyther to bleamish the one or slaunder the other in our christian pietie, and that with such a notable blot for euer, as liuing men, obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our faultes, as witnesses eyther of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or falshode, may also cōmende them to a perpetuall posteritie. Such therefore is the excellent Maiestie of a true historie, as nothing in humayne things is to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before it, and such the necessitie of it both in priuate and publicke, as well in all states and pollicies, as also conducible to Religion, directing withall euerie degree in his duetie and true vse of the same. And lastly, it is the liuely Image of time and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whiche vnder God, most absolutely, doth gouerne and: esolue oure transitorie endeuours and actions: A most true loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glasse for the soueraigne to beholde continually, and a sound studie for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to bee had still in vse.
