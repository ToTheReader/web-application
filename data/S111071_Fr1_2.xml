And such a truth is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your fauor: which if it may acquit my zeale vnto your Knight and You, of thanks though not of satisfaction. For hauing thought your selfe most worthy to defend this truth, opposed by one of your own sexe, &amp; almost of the same rank, I shall according to my wish esteeme it sutable to your person, whom with your honourable Husband, I doe now leaue to Heauens disposall; which may enable me to discharge a further duty.</p>
