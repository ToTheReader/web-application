   <head>A WOORD OR TWO CONCERNING CEREMONIES.</head>
   <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of learning, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōlie and with verie great reason doe complaine, that artes and sciences, haue no other eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie them the ignorant man. Euen so, we likewise at this day, may iustlie cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and say the same, that touching the affaires of Religion, we finde no greater enimies and mocquers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and principallie of the religious ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Ceremonies belonging to the same, then those who are most of all ignorant of their sense and meaning. And wheras we see in this our cursed and execrable age, a great number of
<pb facs="10"/> Christians so easilie contemne, and so impudentlie mock at such godlie Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; so if they rightlie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the reason of them, they would certainlie receiue them with singular deuotion.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Thou therfore, gentle Reader, I pray thee vnderstand, that amōgst all the fiue sences of nature which God hath giuen vs, two especiallie (to wit, our Eares, and our Eies) are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called. <hi>Sensus doctrinae, aut disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae.</hi> Senses of doctrine, or discipline: that is to say, whereby we are made capable, to receiue instructions and discipline; For without these two, it is impossible euer to learne anie thinge, and by the meanes of these two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall senses, we come to vnderstand and learne, all maner of sciences. All the Ceremonies therfore of the Masse, are instituted by the Church princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to instruct the people by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of seeing. And euen as they who
<pb facs="10"/> would take away preaching out of the Church, doe as much as if they should stop vp the peoples eares: euen so they who would take away the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the Church, doe as much as in them lyeth, to hide, or cleane put out, the peoples eies.</p>
   <p n="3">3. What then may we thinke or say, of the pernicious practises of the Arch-heretiques of our age? Yea, and how iust occasion haue those which are of their owne religion (as well as we) to crye out against them? For first these malicious Masters, haue quite cassierd a great nūber of godlie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, from amongst the Christian people, in all citties and countries whersoeuer they haue liued. And next, euen of those few which still they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, they as vtterlie depriue them of their sense and meaning, as if there were not so much as any one vsed, in all their religion.</p>
   <p n="4">4. But what suppose you to be, the
<pb facs="11"/> drift and legierdemain of these decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? Forsooth, because knowing full well, that in our Catholique Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, there are comprehended and lye hid, so manie notable mysteries, they plainlie foresee, that if they should trulie explicat and manifest vnto the people, the sense and meaning of some of their owne, they should presentlie giue thē a light, and inflame their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with the loue of ours. For which cause (as by a subtle and craftie deuise) they for the most part, ether conceale them from them, or speake in contēpt and hatred of them.</p>
   <p n="5">5. To make this point the more apparent; Of how manie thousandes of them may you aske these questions, before you shall meete with one that can make you answere? For example, aske them. Why, to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their common seruice, the Clark and Minister must be clad in white, rather then in black, blew, or
<pb facs="11"/> yeallow, or in a coate, or garment of any other colour? Aske them, why in saying the same seruice, the lesson, is read out of the ould testament, and and not out of the new? and why not all scripture out of the ould, or al out of the new? Aske them why the ould testament is read before the new: and why not the newe before the ould, seeing it is of farr greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as them selues do freely confesse? Aske them, why they kneele at the saying of the Lordes prayer, and rise vp at the Creede; rather then rise vp at the Lordes prayer, and kneele downe at the Creede? Aske them, why they set the Font neere the Church doore, and the Communion table within the Chancel: and why not as well the Cōmuniō table at the Church doore, &amp; the Font within the Chancell? Aske them why they command mē to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat often, and to be Baptised but once; &amp; why not to be Baptised often
<pb facs="12"/> and to Comunicat but once; especially if (as sectaries say) they be but seales? I omit for breuitie sake, the churching of womē. The marrying with a ringe. God fathers and God mothers in the Sacrament of Baptisme. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of childrē. &amp;c. Al which, with a hundred more which I might name, the Protestant Cleargy do still retaine, wherof the people no more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning, then the man in the Moone.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Now therfore, for as much as all Ceremonies (vsed for the better, &amp; more solemne settinge foorth of the deuine seruice) are of one of these two sortes, that is to say, ether Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, or Significatiue, it followeth, that to weare a white Surplesse, rather then a black; or to reade for the firste Lesson, rather part of the ould Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt thē of the new: or to set the Fōt at the Church doore, rather then within the Chancell (or in the bottom of the
<pb facs="12"/> belfrie) are nothinge, Commoditatiue, nether to the Priest, nor yet to the people; ergo they are Significatiue, that is to say, signifying some speciall mysterie, wherin the Christian people ought to be instructed.</p>
   <p n="7">7. The holie Ceremonies therfore of our Religion, if they were explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thee, gentle Reader (if thou be a Protestant) as they are vnto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, they would assuredlie yeald thee, most singular comfort; wherein I will report me to thyne owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, after thou shalt haue first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used, the explication onlie of these which appertaine to the Masse (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou hast here set downe, euerie word, sentence, and sillable that is in the same.) Nothing douting, but that in the end, thou thy selfe wilt freelie confesse, that the hearers and behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the holie Masse, enioy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, a most incredible comfort, by occasion of the Ceremonies, which
<pb facs="13"/> are handled therein: which thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Protestant, canst neuer enioy, by assisting or being present, at thy morning prayer. Trye, and then trust, and so farwell.</p>
