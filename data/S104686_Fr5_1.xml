      <head>To the Reader.</head>
      <p>GEntle Reader, it is possible that some wyll thinke that I haue taken vpon mee to meddle with those causes, that are past my capacity, for that this fyfth and last boke is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the naturall causes of Sands in the Sea and riuers, and the cause of marish ground, and Cliffes by the sea Coasts, and rockes in the Sea, and also the cause that the sea dooth ebbe and flow, and the cause that the water in the Sea is salt, and the cause of Earth quakes, with other matters. And for that my opinion dooth differ from some of the auncient writers in naturall Phylosophy, it is possible that it may be vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked of and condemned to be no trueth. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they may geue such credit vnto it, as the sequell of the reasons shall support vnto them, for that they bee but my simple opinions: wherfore they may beleeue them as they lift. Therfore gentle Readers, I desyre you to beare with me, for that I am so bolde to shew my simple opinion vnto the world, for it is possible, that some people may mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice me, for that I am so bolde to deale in these causes, consydering what a great number of so excellent learned menne there are in Englande, bothe in the Vniuersyties, and in diuers other places in this Lande.</p>
