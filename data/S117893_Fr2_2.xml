   <p>REligion is the <hi>sacred Bond betweene God and vs:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Papists are better seene by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise than controvesies</note> And the <hi>certaintie</hi> of the <hi>Trueth professed</hi> maketh it stronger. In this <hi>litigious</hi> age, <hi>Contentions haue almost buried the Trueth:</hi> And the inconsiderate Reader of Controversies, shall neither <hi>finde Papists in their diverse and contradictorie opinions, nor himselfe.</hi> The best reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for that certaintie, (next to Scripture) is not so much by the <hi>theoricke of controversies,</hi> as the <hi>practicke of Now-Romes pertinancie:</hi> Therefore it shall be a <hi>price worth our labour, to consider Rome as now it standeth,</hi> and the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall shifts</hi> whereby shee hath driven her selfe to it.</p>
   <p>Her present estate is a <hi>judiciall hardnesse:</hi> In that most<note place="margin">They are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.</note>

      <hi>Austine</hi> calleth it, <hi>that maketh men defend errour for trueth, and pursue trueth for errour:</hi> And all their businesse in wryting, disputing, &amp;c. is that <hi>made presumption,</hi> (as <hi>Patianus</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis insanae est Facian ad Sympron.</note> sayeth) <hi>whereby they seeke only the victorie in any cause:</hi> And like the olde Pagans, they <hi>choose rather to obtrude their owne errours impudently, than patiently to heare our Trueth,</hi> as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> said to <hi>Demetrian: Potius tua impudenter ingerere; quàm nostra patienter audire.</hi> As <hi>Copernicus</hi> in <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus</hi> in <hi>Physicke, loathing olde Trueths</hi> layed their new <hi>Hypotheses, and threw all things by the haire to countenance them;</hi> so doe they in their new broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heresies: And like <hi>Photinus (c) seeke not to show a reason of their doctrine to their hearers; but draw things that are simply spoken to the colouring of their errour,</hi> as <hi>Ruffinus</hi>

   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="64"/>The first Ages delighted to <hi>comment Scripture:</hi> But<note place="margin">They hane wedded thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Trent faith.</note> when <hi>Lombard</hi> gathered his sentences, their itching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines loathed Scripture, and <hi>commented Lombard:</hi> And when <hi>Thomas</hi> (the floure of the Schoole) had diggested his <hi>summes,</hi> they were made <hi>the Text, for commenting, and reading in Schooles:</hi> And the <hi>Canons of Trent are more holy than all;</hi> not to bee <hi>commented,</hi> least Trueth breake out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their hands, but to bee <hi>believed and adored</hi> as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: <hi>So they stand now in the pertinacious defence of the Antichristian Faith, canonized in Trent.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is the present estate of the Romish Church,<note place="margin">Their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable shifts. 1 They shift Scripture.</note> wherevnto shee hath drawne her selfe, by <hi>seven necessarie (but miserable) shiftings.</hi> First, at their great challenge by <hi>Luther,</hi> they <hi>began with Scripture:</hi> Though <hi>Caietan</hi> lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the bushes of <hi>Schoole-divinitie,</hi> and <hi>Prierias</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his <hi>Cases,</hi> yet <hi>Eccius</hi>

         </gap>anus.</note> and others appealed to Scripture. But when they had assayed, they found it hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: I herefore they cast it away with contempt, calling it a <hi>nose of waxe, a leaden sword,</hi> &amp;c. like the olde Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who (as <hi>Irenie</hi> (<hi>b</hi>) sayeth) <hi>turned to the accusation of Scripture, when they were convinced by Scripture: Cum à Scripturis arguuntur, in accusationem earum convertuntur.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Colloq. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>0.</note> Before the Colloque of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> when the Protestant Divines intercommuned by letter with the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> that they would <hi>agree on the places of arguments:</hi> The <hi>Iesuits</hi> in their Preface declared <hi>that they would not stand to Scripture, least</hi> (say they) <hi>we had lost our cause in the verie entrie.</hi> I his their distrust of Scripture is a <hi>reall confessing that their faith is not Scripturall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, they came to <hi>Traditions;</hi> and because wee<note place="margin">2 Traditions</note> sticke to Scripture, they called vs <hi>Scripturarij;</hi> to tell vs, that <note n="a" place="margin">

         </gap>res</note> they are <hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Hereticks: And againe, <hi>Credunt sine Scripturis, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>scrip.</note>. And yet they finde no rest in Traditions: The <hi>indefinetnes of their number,</hi> the <hi>confus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
      <pb facs="64"/>
      <hi>of their kinds, Divine: Apostolicke, Ecclesiasticke,</hi> hath confounded them, who expresly laboured to distinguish<note place="margin">

But <note n="d" place="margin">Lactan. l. 5. cap. 20.</note> the first tymes <hi>reasoned not from their owne asseveration, but by divine testimonies,</hi> as sayeth <hi>Lactantius, Non asseveratione propriâ, sed testimonijs Divinis, sicut nos facimus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly from Traditions of an vncertaine Author, they come to <hi>Fathers,</hi> and with a <hi>froggish and laterane co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axation,</hi>
      <note place="margin">3 Fathers.</note> doe cry <hi>Patres, Patres.</hi> But Protestants haue dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them from that retreate also; for though in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers some <hi>Liturgicall ceremonie</hi> may bee found, yet in <hi>Dogmaticke poynts</hi> they are all for vs: Neither can they make <hi>Lirinensis</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Lyrinens commonitor.</note>
      <hi>triple tryall,</hi> to fitte their <hi>Tenets,</hi> that they were receaved <hi>ab omnibus, semper &amp; vbique.</hi> Fathers are worthie of respect, when they speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Heavenly Father: They gaue that respect to their Ancestors, and craved no more to themselues. Who ever shall reade these things, <hi>let him not imitate mee erring, but growing to the better: Non me imitetur errantem,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>(a)</hi> Proleg. retract.</note>
      <hi>sed in melias proficientem,</hi> sayeth <hi>Augustine,</hi> even of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations <note n="b" place="margin">Dur. fol. 140.</note>. And they themselues condemne the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, except they speake to their sense.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, from Fathers a-part, they come to <hi>Fathers mette together in Councells:</hi> So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> everie where<note place="margin">4 Counsells.</note> thinketh it enough, <hi>In hoc conveniunt omnes Scholastici propter Conciliorum authoritatem.</hi> But when these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells are searched, they are but <hi>late Conventicles</hi> gathered for their purpose, as <hi>Dioscorus</hi> did at <hi>Ephesus▪ Irene</hi> at <hi>Neece</hi> The Laterane Councells: of <hi>Florence, Constance, Basile.</hi> And lastly, their <hi>Trent</hi> Councell by a preposterous order, giving authoritie to the former. They contemne ancient and lawfull Councells, as <hi>Vives</hi> remarketh, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua</hi>
      <note place="margin">Vives in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</note>
      <hi>non pluris aestimant, quam conventus muliercularum in textrina vel thermis: These are Councels to them</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>which serue their turne, as for other they count no</hi>

      <hi>more of them Conventions of Women, &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">5 <hi>Popes.</hi> testimonie.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Fifthly, they muster the <hi>Testimonies of their Popes,</hi> as the last <hi>and greatest ground of their Faith:</hi> A matter more ridiculous than serious, to judge a <hi>malefactor by his</hi>
      <note place="margin">Popes iudge and partie▪</note>
      <hi>owne testimonie:</hi> If they thinke them infallible, why giue they them not the first place? They are neither as <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pili</hi> or <hi>Triarij,</hi> but rather <hi>Rorarij</hi> and <hi>Ferentarij</hi> amongst the Legions, more for number than for weight: But the wiser <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ort are ashamed to vse these shaddowes in disputs.</p>
   <p>Sixtly: When they finde no safetie in all these refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">6. Philosophie</note> they come to <hi>humane learning:</hi> And for this cause, the Iesuits (seeing their Cleargie ignorant) affected <hi>a Monarchie of Letters:</hi> As <hi>Ierome</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Hieron in Esay 19.</note> said of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who called themselues <hi>Reges Philosophorum, Kings of the Philosophs.</hi> They are destitute of Scripture, and runne to the supplie of Nature &amp; Arte.
