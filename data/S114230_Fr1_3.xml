         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Am not Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) according to the saying of the Poet, <hi>Scribimus indoct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> docti{que} poemata passim,</hi> That godly &amp; learned treatises of all sorts abound; &amp; this consideration might well haue stayed my penne from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Know therefore that not vaine glory, but a sensible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low feeling of the wronges and iniurses offered to my brethren (by reason of a certaine imbred
<pb facs="5"/>selfe-loue reigning for the most part in the heart of the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor) hath stirred vp in me a setled resolution, to cast in my widdows mite (notwithstanding the many rich guifts, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy workes of the more learned) into the Lords treasury Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my onely scope and drift is to shew forth my forward and willing disposition in labouring to repaire the ruins and decaies of loue and piety, which this age hath almost throwne flat on the ground: if Narcissus like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> dote not to much vpon mine owne shaddow. Many thinks it sufficient, if they can talke and dispute of faith, if they be able to reason and discourse in eloquent wordes of religion: when they haue small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to turne their talking into walking, their wordes into
<pb facs="5"/>workes, and their profession into practise.</p>
   <p>For whereas we should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest our faith and loue of God, in our loue, charity, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards our neighbour, many notwithstanding are now become so degenerate, and such <hi>Non proficients</hi> in the Schoole of true Christian inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that in their actions they are malicious, enuying, cruell, deceitfull, contentious, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, scandalous, haters of God, iniurious, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection, and mercilesse. But wee haue not so learned Christ, neither can it be (what shew soeuer they make) that the loue of God should rest in that heart, where fraudulent, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, malicious, and enuying Foxes haue made their dennes. <hi>For if a man say hee loueth
<pb facs="6"/>God, and hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a liar: for how can hee that loueth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom hee hath seene, loue God whom hee hath not seene?</hi> as saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Iohn.</hi> And hee that would know how to loue his neighbour aright, must first entertaine the loue of God in his heart; and the loue of God is retained by practising the loue of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For euen as the heate of the naturall body warmeth the cloathes that are put vpon it, which cloathes afterward nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and conserue the naturall heate: so the fire of the loue of God, which springeth of faith, kindleth the heart with the loue of thy neighbour, and the loue of our neighbour cherisheth the loue of God in our harts. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if these endeauours of mine
<pb facs="6"/>shall effect any good, it is the thing that I desire; and let God haue the praise: if not, yet I haue discharged my conscience. Therefore I humbly beseech thee into whose hands these wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings shall come, throughly to reade them at thy leasure, and to marke them well; begin not onely, but make an end: for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the best wine is reserued till the last. And the God of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and consolation, make vs followers of God as deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and grant that we be like minded one towards another, after the example of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
