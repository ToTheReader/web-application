   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was neuer any thing by the wie of man so well deuised, or so surely established, which (in continuāce of time) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thinges) it may plainly appere by the common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Churche, commonly called diuine seruice: the firste originall and grounde whereof, if a manne woulde searche out by the auncient fathers, he shall finde that thesame was not ordeyned, but of a good purpose, and for a great aduauncement of godlines: For they so ordred the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest parte thereof) should be read ouer once in the yeare, intendyng thereby, that the Cleargie, and specially suche as were Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often readyng and meditacion of Gods worde) be stirred vp to godlines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfes, and be more able also to exhorte other by wholsome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduersaries to the trueth. And further, that the people (by daily hearyng of holy scripture read in the Churche) should continuallye profite more and more in the knowlege of God, and bee the more inflamed with the loue of his true religion. But these many yeares passed, this Godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath bee so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in vncertein stories, Legēdes, Respondes, Verses, vaine repeticions, Commemoracions and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, that commonly when any boke of the Bible was begon: before three or foure Chapiters were read out, all the rest were vnread. And in this sorte, the boke of Esaie was begon in Aduent, and the booke of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis in Septuagesima: but they were onely begon, and neuer read tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. After a like sorte wer other bokes of holy scripture vsed. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, whereas s. Paule would haue suche language spoken to the people in the churche, as they mighte vnderstande and haue profite by hearyng thesame: the seruice in this Church of England (these many yeares) hath been read in Latin to the people, whiche they vnderstoode not, so that they haue heard with theyr cares onely: &amp; their hartes, spirite and minde, haue not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithstandyng that the auncient fathers had deuided the psalmes into seuen porcions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery one was called a nocturne: now of late tyme a fewe of them haue been dailye sayed (and ofte repeated) and the rest vtterly omitted. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the nōbre &amp; hardnes of the rules called the pie, and the manifolde chaunginges of the seruice, was the cause, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> to turne the boke onlye, was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times, there was more busines to fynd out what should be read, then to read it when it was founde out.</p>
   <p>These inconueniences therfore considered: here is set furth suche an ordre, whereby thesame shalbe redressed. And for a readines in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, here is drawen out a kalendar for that purpose, whiche is plaine and easy to be vnderstanded, wherin (so muche as maie be) the readyng of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture is so set furthe, that all thynges shall bee doen in ordre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breakyng one piece therof from another. For this cause be cut of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes, Respondes, Inuitatories, and suche like thynges, as did breake
<pb facs="3"/>
the continuall course of the readyng of the scripture. Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessitie there must be some rules: therfore certein rules are here set furth, whiche as they be fewe in nōbre: so they be plain and easy to be vnderstanded. So y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> here you haue an ordre for praier (as touchyng the readyng of holy scripture) muche agreable to the mynde &amp; purpose of the olde fathers, and a greate deale more profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, then that whiche of late was vsed. It is more profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause here are left out many thynges, whereof some be vntrue, some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certein, some vain and supersticious: and is ordeyned nothyng to be read, but the very pure worde of God, the holy scriptures, or that whiche is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently grounded vpon the same: and that in suche a language &amp; ordre, as is moste easy &amp; plain for the vnderstandyng, bothe of the readers and hearers. It is also more cōmodious, bothe for the shortnes thereof, &amp; for the plaines of the ordre, &amp; for that the rules be fewe &amp; easy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the curates shal nede none other bookes for their publique seruice, but this boke &amp; the Bible: by the meanes wherof, the people shall not be at so great charge for bookes, as in tyme past they haue been.</p>
   <p>And where heretofore, there hath been great diuersitie in saying and synging in churches within this realme: some folowyng Salsbury vse, some Herford vse, some the vse of Bangor, some of Yorke, &amp; some of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne: Now from hēcefurth, all the whole realme shall haue but one vse.</p>
   <p>And if any would iudge this waye more painfull, because that all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges must be read vpō the boke, where as before, by the reason of so often repeticion, they could saye many thinges by heart: if those men will waye their labor, with the profite in knowlege, whiche dayely they shal obtein by readyng vpon the boke, they will not refuse the payn, in consideracion of the greate profite that shall ensue therof.</p>
   <p>And forsomuche as nothyng can, almoste, be so plainly set furth, but doubtes maie rise in the vse &amp; practisyng of the same: to appease all suche diuersitie (if any arise) and for the resolucion of all doubtes, concernyng the maner how to vnderstande, do, and execute the thynges conteygned in this booke: the parties that so doubt, or diuersly take any thyng, shall alwaye resorte to the Bishop of the Diocese, who by his discrecion shall take ordre for the quietyng and appeasyng of the same: so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteigned in this boke.</p>
   <p>❧Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that al thinges shalbe read and songe in the churche, in the Englishe tongue, to thende that the congregacion maie be therby edified: yet it is not meante, but when men saye Matins and Euensong priuately, they maye saie the same in any language that they thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do vnderstande. Neither that any man shalbe bounde to the saying of them, but suche as from tyme to tyme, in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall and Collegiate Churches, Parishe Churches, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles to the same annexed, shall serue the congregacion.</p>
