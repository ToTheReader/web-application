   <head>A conclusion to the Reader, containing a particular Description, and relation of some things omitted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Discourse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, seeing my former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery receiued such good approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allowance before it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it puts me in some hope, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so receiue good acceptance from all his Maiesties well-affected Subiects, now that it is published; the which when I shall vnderstand, by their thankfull acceptance, I shall be incouraged the more willingly, to set forth what I haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued touching the Altitude of some head-lands of that Coast, on the East side of the <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and also the Deepes, and seuerall soundings, that I haue taken notice of in my trauels to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; which I conceiue to be necessary for those that shall henceforth trade thither; which as yet no man, to my knowledge, hath vndertaken; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be ready with my life and meanes whatsoeuer I haue, or may haue in this World, to discouer other Bayes and Harbours round about that land, which are yet vndiscouered, whereby to finde out some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new Trades with the Natiues of the Countrey; for they haue great store of red Oaker, which they
<pb facs="46"/>
vse to colour their Bodies, Bowes and Arrowes, and Cannowes withall, which Cannowes are built in shape, like the Wherries on the Riuer of Thames; but that they are much longer, made with the rinds of Birch trees; which they sowe very artificially and close together, and ouerlay euery seame with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine; and in like manner they sowe the rindes of Spruce trees, round and deepe, in proportion like a brasse kettle, to boyle their meate in, which hath been well proued by three Mariners of a Shippe, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at Anchor by mee, who being robbed in the night by the Sauages, of their apparell and diuers prouisions, did the next day seeke after them, and came suddainely where they had set vp three Tents, and were feasting, hauing three Cannowes by them, and had three pots made of such rindes of trees, standing each of them on three stones boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with twelue Fowles in each of them; euery Fowle as bigge as a Widgeon, and some so bigge as a Ducke: they had also many such pots so sowed, and fashioned like the leather buckets that are vsed for quenching of fire, and those were full of the yolkes of egges, that they had taken and boyled hard, and so dried small, which the Sauages vsed in their broth, as Sugar is vsed in some meates: they had great store of the Skinnes of Deere, Beauers, Beares, Seales, Otters, and diuers other fine skinnes which were well dressed; as also great store of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sorts of flesh dryed; and by shooting off a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket towards them, they all ranne away naked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparell, but only their hats on their heads, which were made of Seales skinnes, in fashion like our hats, sowed handsomely with narrow bands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="46"/>
them, set round with fine white shels, such as are carried from <hi>Portugall</hi> to <hi>Braseile</hi>; where they passe to the <hi>Indians</hi> as ready money. All their three Cannowes, their Flesh, Skinnes, Yolks of Egges, Targets, Bowes and Arrowes, and much fine Okar, and diuers other things, they tooke and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and shared it amongst those three that tooke it, and brought to me the best Cannowe, Bowes and Arrowes, and diuers of their Skinnes, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things worth the noting: which may seeme to inuite vs to finde out some other trades vvith them.</p>
   <p>Now also I will not omit to relate some thing of a strange Creature that I first saw there in the yeere 1610. in a morning early as I was standing by the water side, in the Harbour of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi>; which I espyed very swiftly to come swimming towards me, looking cheerefully, as it had been a woman, by the Face, Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Chin, Eares, Necke and Forehead: It seemed to be so beautifull, and in those parts so well proportioned, hauing round about vpon the head, all blew strakes, resembling hayre, dovvne to the Necke (but certainly it vvas no haire:) for I beheld it long, and another of my Company also, yet liuing, that vvas not then farre from me; and seeing the same comming so svviftly tovvards me, I stepped backe, for it vvas come vvithin the length of a long Pike. Which vvhen this strange Creature savv, that I vvent from it, it presently thereupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a little vnder vvater, and did swim tovvards the place where before I landed; whereby I beheld the shoulders and backe dovvne to the middle, to be as square, vvhite and smooth as the backe of a man, and from the middle to the hinder part, poynting in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb facs="47"/>
like a broad hooked Arrow; how it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned in the forepart, from the necke and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I know not; but the same came shortly after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Boate, wherein one <hi>William Hawkridge,</hi> then my seruant, was, that hath bin since a Captaine in a ship to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and is lately there imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> in the like Voyage; and the same Creature did put both his hands vpon the side of the Boate, and did striue to come in to him and others then in the said Boate: whereat they were afraide; and one of them strooke it a full blow on the Head; whereby it fell off from them: and afterwards it came to two other Boats in the said Harbour; the men in them, for feare fled to land: This (I suppose) was a Maremaide. Now because diuers haue written much of Maremaids, I haue presumed to relate, what is most certaine of such a strange Creature that was seene at <hi>New-found-land:</hi> whether it were a Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid or no, I know not; I leaue it for others to iudge, &amp;c.</p>
