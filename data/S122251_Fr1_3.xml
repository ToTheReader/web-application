   <head>Vpon the accurate translation of the Lord <hi>Du Praissac</hi> his Militarie discourses, done by his esteemed friend Captain JOHN CRUSO.</head>
   <l>TImes have their <hi>Genii:</hi> yea; and Places too.</l>
   <l>For contemplation some are; some to do.</l>
   <l>That Laurell, which ha's crown'd <hi>Astraea</hi>'s head,</l>
   <l>May to <hi>Bellona</hi>'s front be altered.</l>
   <l>Arts have their times too. In that season sing</l>
   <l>The Muses nine about their dancing spring:</l>
   <l>Another while much fitter Musick are</l>
   <l>Those sterner arts, that teach us how to warre:</l>
   <l>(Happie that age, that can so much foresee,</l>
   <l>To study warre in her tranquillitie.)</l>
   <l>That Amazonian offspring, which doth sit</l>
   <l>Near <hi>Pallas</hi> strength, and near <hi>Minerva</hi>'s wit.</l>
   <l>These teach the needfull use of Armes to know;</l>
   <l>To march by their field-musick quick, or slow;</l>
   <l>To sit down 'fore a town; T'encamp in field;</l>
   <l>How to embattail; And how forts to build;</l>
   <l>T'assault; defend; To famine; force; surprize;</l>
   <l>How to releeve besieg'd; void treacheries;</l>
   <l>And (that which makes commanders worths grow high)</l>
   <l>How stratagems to make; and how t' apply:</l>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <l>Of these the Lord <hi>Praissac</hi> the skill hath shown:</l>
   <l>(So Greatnesse by her vertues best is known)</l>
   <l>To fortifie; To make a Canonier;</l>
   <l>To contrive fireworks are directed here;</l>
   <l>And, lest th' unpractick off'cer of a Band</l>
   <l>Should know his title, but not understand</l>
   <l>His place, and dutie, he hath tane some pain</l>
   <l>To teach. 'Twere hard, his labour should prove vain;</l>
   <l>And most industrious <hi>Cruso</hi> loose his end,</l>
   <l>That to the state did so much oyl intend.</l>
   <l>He, that hath but the language, boldly may</l>
   <l>Seek to translate, yet is but half the way.</l>
   <l>Who renders Sence for Sence, and Words of Art</l>
   <l>Does properly expound, does act the Part.</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Praissac</hi> is well-come into England. We</l>
   <l>May joy in him: But yeeld our thanks to Thee.</l>
