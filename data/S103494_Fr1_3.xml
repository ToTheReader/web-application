   <head>The Argument, and cause of this Poem.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing lately in Antwerpe,
it was my fortune to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
an old printed Booke
in prose, which I haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Verse, of the life,
death &amp; buriall of our blessed Lady: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I read many things worthy of obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and many things friuolous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
out of the which I haue (like a Bee)
suck't the sacred hony of the best authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Scriptures, and Fathers which I
best credited, and I haue left the poyson
<pb facs="5"/>
of Antichristianisme to those where I
found it (whose stomackes can better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it,) I put it to the Presse, presuming
it shall be accepted of pious Protestants
and charitable Catholikes; as for luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
Neutralists that are neyther hot
nor cold, they doe offend my appetite, and
therefore vp with them. The schismaticall
Separatist, I haue many times discoursed
with him, and though he be but a Botcher
or a Button-maker, and at the most, a
lumpe of opinionated ignorance, yet hee
<pb facs="5"/>
will seeme to wring the Scriptures to his
opinions, and presume to know more of the
mysteries of Religion, then any of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
learned Bishops and Doctors.</p>
   <p>I know this worke will be vnrelished in
the pestiferous pallates of the dogmaticall
Amsterdammatists; but I do, must, and will
acknowledge a most reuerend honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
vnto the sacred memory of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
virgin Lady, Mother of our Lord and
Redeemer Iesus; and in my thoughts she
shall euer haue superlatiue respect aboue all
<pb facs="6"/>
Angels, Principalities, Patriarkes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apostles, Euangelists or Saints what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soeuer,
vnder the blessed Trinity; yet
(mistake me not) as there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Immortall Creator, and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
creature, so (whilst I haue warrant
sufficient from God himselfe, to inuocate
his Name onely) I will not giue man, Saint,
or Angell any honour that may be deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his eternall Maiestie.</p>
   <p>As amongst Women she was blest aboue
all, being aboue all full of Grace, so amongst
<pb facs="6"/>
Saints I beleeue she is supreame in Glory:
and it is an infallible truth, that as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
doe dishonour her much by their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
honourable seeming attributes;
so on the other part, it is hellish and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to God and good men, either to forget
her, or (which is worse) to remember her
with impure thoughts, or vnbeseeming
speech for the excellency of so deuine a
Creature. I confesse my selfe the meanest
of men, and most vnworthy of all to write
of her that was the best of Women, but my
<pb facs="7"/>
hope is, that Charity will couer my faults,
and accept of my good meaning, especially
hauing endeuoured and striuen to doe my
best: So wishing all hearts to giue this holy
Virgin such honour as may be pleasing to
God; which is, that all should patterne
their liues to her lifes example, in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and humility, and then they shall be
exalted where shee is in Glory, with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
