All thynges were equally deuyded amongest them, that they had neither more nor lesse then the heuens, the earth, together with the waters commen so that they were not couetous of any honoure or ryches, hauynge

Fyrst for theyr ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel toke the large leaues of trees but a lyttel after, the world began to inuent the wayes to cloth theim with the skinnes of bestes, one lyke vnto the other. Man created was so lyttle carefull to be in suertye, that he did not passe or desyre to be loked vp in walled Cities, or in for treses, made with stronge rampers but wandred and strayed abrode lyke other beastes, and had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine place to take his rest, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge

in the fielde rested hym. To whom when that the night appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was in greate tranquylytie without feare of theues or robbers yet at the last beinge compelled to do the contrary by such lyke chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by succession of tyme that the worlde might encrease and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye, whiche the enuey and dyuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of their wiles was the cause of the varietie, and chaunge of the hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayne inclinations, agayne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the industry and labour of man the fruites whiche came from the earth, was not sufficient to norishe them, that lyued then, prouoked them to exercyse one with an other and by the aboue sayde Calamyties they were so greatly weryed with trauayles that they folowed the coures of wylde beastes, wherfore the humayne creatures by lyttle &amp; lyttle accompanyenge togethers,
<pb facs="11"/>
consultede, by a commen seecours and ayde to expulse such euyl cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and hurtes, beganne to prepare and appoint to eueryone of theym certeine portions of grounde, vpon the which they buylded lyttle hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and made perticions of theyr landes by certeyne limittes, in so much that by little and lyttle, they made dyches and walles, and at the last there was appoynted a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeir estate or common weal. In lykewyse they established certeine lawes and magestrates, by whome euery man shulde be ruled. In so muche at the last there was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a greate concorde and peace amongest so great a multytude of people. Sins that tyme men inuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to lyue not onely by the fruites and noriture which the erth hir self brought forth, and that the beastes or cattell gaue, but also by their

manye and sundry industries and labours by theym excogitated, and founde out the maner to make the shippes to ryde vpon the seas, some to serue for marchaundyse, other some to abyde the countreys. Also some inuented the cartes with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to drawe theym, and after that they began to haue course gold and syluer, then was the aparel of men more sumptuous, theyr language adorned with eloquens, theyr fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentacion more siuile, theyr diete more delicate, their building more larger and gorgious, in fyne the morrall creatures in continuaunce of tyme, were altred and chaunged as well from theyr condicions, as from theyr barbarousnes and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elnes, they became humayne, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyl, and gracious, that at the laste they ruled them selues so discretely that they them selues banyshed all
<pb facs="12"/>
their inhumanitie, and vnciuilitie as to kyll one an other, to eate the fleshe of men, and to occupye the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the first they mete without discrecion or regarde of blud or kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, with such lyke vices and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. After they had tasted of this euyll order, and atteyne to more reson by theyr trauaile, made the earth fruteful, the which before was hydden ouer as a wylde forest, vnhabited and moost vnprofitable for man. They remoued away the great stones and stubbes of trees, made the fayre waters &amp; sprynges to be sought for, in the marshe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This they did and all to make it plaine, and to cause it lose his old and auncient forme, wheras before it was hilly and rude. In so vsyng the earth, at the last brought forth wynes and other encrease aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, the whiche before did yelde

them but a lyttle quantitie of wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges &amp; crabs.

Ageyne theyr places where they inhabited at the first were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but hauyng dwelt there a time from smale vyllages became great Cyties. vpon the hygh mountaines they buylded townes and stronge castels, &amp; in the valeyes great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and churches, to the ende that the fountaines might be more hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sommer and delectable. they were richli made of faire cut marbelstone and they set trees al about to giue them a pleasaunt shadowe. And more frome the sayde welles they
<pb facs="13"/>
caused waters by the pipes to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende and come into theyr Cyties They made hauens &amp; crekes in the sea to harbor the ships. They also made many ryght places, into the whiche the shyppes myght retyre backe without daunger of windes and tempestes At the end they had so appoyncted al thynges as well in the sea, as in the lande, which yf we do consider the state present and after what it was afore tyme, a man wolde take it to be a countrey aboue all other, then that whiche was fyrst created, and wold iudge it more lyke the gardeyne or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyse out of the whiche oure forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Adam and Eue was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the transgression of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly commaundement then other wyse.
