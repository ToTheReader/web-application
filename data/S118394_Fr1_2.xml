   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or your sakes in generall (beloued in the Lord Iesus) I haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to lay my selfe open in these my poore endeuours, to the view and censure of all the world. For your comfort, I first spake them, and for your profit I haue now penned them, that if any thing were at the first mistaken, and not well vnderstood, or since that, hath bene forgotten, and as yet is vnpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, you might now learne it better, remember it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; practise it euer, to your endles cōfort. But that which hath chiefly preuailed with me for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing hereof, is the earnest desire of many, and special entreatie of some poore Christiās, afflicted in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which came vnto me since, with their imperfect notes of their owne gathering, which I tooke as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pledges of some comfort already receaued, and argumēts of a holy desire to be further profited ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Whose Christian desire, and godly hunger I take in this case as a sufficient calling hereunto, neither do I yet see how I could well haue made them a deniall, without some preiudice to their soules, some aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the enemie, and some checke vnto my owne cōscience. For the matter it selfe: I cōfesse, it is of that Maiestie, and excellencie, that it requireth both large and deepe discourses, wherein many both learned &amp; godly haue not bene wanting. My care hath bene to be found and plaine, for the benefite especially of the

simpler sort. And as the woman in the Gospel thought her selfe happy if she might but touch the hem of Christes garmēt, so when I began to meditate vpō the assurance of Gods loue, it seemed to be so excellent a point and so full of comfort, that I thought my selfe a happy man if I might but touch the points, &amp; borders thereof, seeing I could not attaine to the full hādling therof. If any ignorant may be instructed in the truth, if any hereby may in time be conuerted to the loue of the truth, if any that is cōuerted, may by this meanes be confirmed in the truth, giue God the glory, and I hold my trauaile sufficiently recōpensed, neither shall it repent me to haue passed through good report, and bad report, through honor and dishonor, &amp; the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of all, so that any profite may redound to your soules, and all the glory may returne vnto God. That God which in his rich mercy hath first planted, and now watered it, cōtinue his good blessing vpon it, that it may become fruifull in vs, and we in it may grow vp as trees planted by the riuers of Gods loue &amp; fauor, to bring forth fruit in due season, thē shall not our leaue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> wither, and that which we take in hand shall prosper, vnto the full fruition, and happy enioying of that his loue, wherof he hath now giuen vs an assurance in his Sonne Iesus Christ. Read well, and reape much, po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
