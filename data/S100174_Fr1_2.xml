Secondly because the order &amp; methode which he hath kept in these Works, is euery day practised in your sessiō house of Scotlād, for in Law-matters you giue place in your sessiō house to the <hi>Confession of the party.</hi> And truly the parties owne acknowledgment of his offence is a sufficient proof amongst all Nations.

      <hi>Vpon thy walles O Hierusalem haue I set watch men, all the day &amp; all the night

Finally, if the Ministers would free thēselues (cōtrary to all Law) from all these precedēt proofes and Iudgments, appealing to the only written Law, &amp; to the expresse word of God (as they do, &amp; must needs do,) first it is easie to be seen by the ensuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises; That all the Ministers togeather shall not, or cannot shew, no not one debatable point of their Religion, to be conteyned in the expresse word. 2. They shall not be able to improue any debatable point of our Religion as being against the expresse word. 3. It is shewed that they haue falsified and corrupted the word of God miserably &amp; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norātly, making it therby not the word of God, but their owne word, &amp; inuention.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>By al which it appeareth sufficiētly, that our Catholike Faith &amp; Religion (for the which now presently we suffer persecution in Scotland) is that selfesame Religion, and Faith wherunto our Scotish Nation was, aboue fourteen hundreth yeares since, confessedly first conuerted: That religion also which euen then, so longe since, and now is professed throughout the Christian world: That Religion also, which was then confirmed to vs, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from heauen with the testimony of vndoubted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: That religion which hath founded your ancient Municipall Lawes, Courts of Iudgement, erected &amp; buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your most famous Churches of Elgene, of Murray, Glasco, Paslay, S. Giles in Edenburgh, Holyrood-house, the Chaunry of Rosse, and many others: That Religion finally which hath erected your Bishops Seas, Religious houses, and Abbayes, Colledges, Vniuersities, and many other knowne Royall monuments of Piety, in your most Noble, and ancient Kingdome of Scotland.</p>
   <p>To the reading therfore of these insuing Parts &amp; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, I earnestly and humbly exhort your Lordships, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the infinit multitude of benefits which God hath bestowed vpon yow, by the pretious Bloud of Christ who hath redeemed vs all, by the tēder care of your own saluation, and by whatsoeuer els is sacred and holy; to the which end I will continue my dayly prayers to God, and remaine alwaies,</p>
