   <head>TO
THE CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Reader, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to all such as haue
any copies of the works
of Maister Perkins, or
intend any of them
to the Presse.</head>
   <p>FOr asmuch as there hath
beene lately signification
made, of diuers of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Perkins</hi> his workes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be Printed, in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Reader premised
before the Treatise of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
and the signification
<pb facs="17"/>
being but generall, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
giue occasion to
some, to set out some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
(without the consent of
Maister <hi>Perkins</hi> his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes)
as imperfectly as are
these two Bookes, intituled,
<hi>The Reformation of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,</hi>
and <hi>The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Faith,</hi> iustly and
truely (for ought that I see)
censured in the aforesaide E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.
It is therefore nowe
thought good to mention the
particular Treatises, and
workes of his, which shall
hereafter (if God will) bee
published, for the benefite of
Gods Church: I doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heereby make knowne to
<pb facs="17"/>
all, whome it any way may
concerne, that there were
found in the Studie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
and are in the hands
of his Executours, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
and preparing for the
Presse.</p>
   <p>1. His Expositions on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Galathians.</p>
   <p>2. On the Epistle of <hi>Iude.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2. His Booke of the Cases of
Gonscience.</p>
   <p>3. His Treatises, 1. Of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.
2. Of Callings.</p>
   <p>All these hee had peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himselfe, and made them
ready for the Presse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which Coppies
by himselfe so corrected,
some of them alreadie are,
<pb facs="18"/>
and the rest will bee published
in due time. And here vpon
wee desire all men who haue
Coppies of them, not to offer
that wrong to that worthy
man of God, as to publish any
of their owne, seeing the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
heereof which are to bee
Printed, are of his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting:
but rather if they
can helpe to make any of them
more perfect by their Coppies,
they may therein dooe a good
worke to the benefit of manie,
and much comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
   <p>And further, I doe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
make knowne, that I haue
in my handes at this present
of his workes, taken from his
<pb facs="18"/>
mouth, with my owne hand,
heereafter (if God will) to bee
published, with the allowance
of our Church, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of his Children, these
particulars.</p>
   <p>1. His Expositions or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
on the 101. psalme.</p>
   <p>2. On the 32. Psalme.</p>
   <p>3. On the 11. chapt. to the
Hebrewes.</p>
   <p>4. On the 1 2 and 3. Chap.
of the Reuelation.</p>
   <p>5. On the 5. 6. &amp; 7. chapt.
of Saint Matthewe.</p>
   <p>2. His confutation of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius,</hi>
his little Popish Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.</p>
   <p>3. His Treatises, 1. Of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations,
out of Gen. 8. 2.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="19"/>
2. Of temptations, out of
<hi>Mathew.</hi> 4.</p>
   <p>3. Of Christian equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
out of Phillippians,
4. 3.</p>
   <p>4. Of the Callings of the
Ministery, out of two places
of Scripture.</p>
   <p>5. Of Repentance, out of
<hi>Zephaniah.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
   <p>Besides many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Sermons, and short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
made vpon seuerall,
and speciall occasions: of all
which, some are alreadie pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by others, and some by
my selfe: and all the rest that
remaine, as they be the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of Gods Church, so did I
willingly dedicate them to
<pb facs="19"/>
the publique and generall
good, Iudging it were a foule
sinne in mee, or any other, to
<hi>impropriate</hi> to our sinnes, or
our owne priuate vse, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of <hi>This,</hi> or any other
learned man, which are in
my opinion; partes of the
<hi>Treasurie</hi> of the militant
Church: And as it were
wrong <hi>to the Church,</hi> if
I should conceale them, so
doubtlesse were it <hi>to him</hi> and
his children, if I should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
them for mine owne alone,
and not for their benefite.
If I doe, I thinke it may bee
iustly saide vnto mee, or
whosoeuer doeth so, <hi>Thy
money perish with thee.</hi>
      <pb facs="20"/>
And what herein I haue saide
for my selfe: I knowe I may
boldely and safely say, for his
Executours or Assignes,
which haue or had in their
handes, anie of those which
were found in his Studie: In
the publishing of all which, as
wee doe intend to deale truely
with the Christian Reader,
and not to commit anie thing
to the Presse, which hath not
eyther beene <hi>written</hi> or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
by the <hi>Author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or faithfullie <hi>penned</hi>
according to the truest Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
taken from his owne
mouth, and since by others of
sufficiency and integritie, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
perused: some purpose
<pb facs="20"/>
to referre them to the benefit
of the <hi>Authours</hi> wife and
children, as much as may be,
wishing that vpon this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat,</hi>
men would not bee so
hastie (as some haue beene) to
commend to the world, their
<hi>vnperfect notes,</hi> vpon a
base desire of a little gaine,
both to hinder the common
good of the Church, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
the said parties of their
priuate benefite, to whom in
all equitie and conscience, it
doth principally appertaine:
And desiring all who haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>perfect</hi> Copies of such as
are in my <hi>owne hands,</hi> that
they would either helpe <hi>mee</hi>
with theirs, or rather take
<pb facs="21"/>
      <hi>mine</hi> to helpe them. That by
our ioynt power, and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
laide together: the walles
of this worthy building, may
goe vp the fayrer, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
And so I commend them
all to Gods blessing, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and their labours,
to God, and to his
Church.</p>
