   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuche as diuerse and sundry lyghte parsons at this day contrary to the mynde and sentence of the auncient doctours and also agaynste the expectacion of moderate wryters of this tyme, do wonderfully wrest all that they reade into the worste sense in mayntenaunce of theyr carnall libertie and dissolute kynde of lyuinge: I haue thought it very expedient, yea (&amp; as the case requireth) more then necessary, that sith this Postille is by me though not made, yet recognized and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places augmented: brefely to admonish the rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, how it ought to be red and receiued. Ye shal ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore vnderstand, that this worke is set forth to youre profite and edification, and not to your hurt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.<note place="margin">☞</note> It is I say setforth not that by the same ye shulde maynteyne any erroniouse doctrine contrary eyther to the kynges maiesties lawes and proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to the determination and sentence of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church. Ye shal not lerne here to despise gods lawes &amp; mans, nor the decent and laudable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and rytes of the church.<note place="margin">What is taught in this Postil.</note> Here is taught no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les libertie to do what you lust, but obedience to God and to hys cōmaūdementes, obedience to the kynges maiestie and to hys lawes, obedience to the holsome traditions of the churche. The sacrament of the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the sacrament of penaunce wyth the other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the church be here not heretically contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but catholikely auaunced. Feyth is here not so nakedly extolled, but that good workes also be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily requyred to be in a christen man. Neyther yet
<pb facs="3"/> be good workes here in such sort magnified, that fay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth which ought to be the fundatiō of the christen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is defrauded of her due place. Only thys one thing I requyre of you, that you wol not rashly iuge of a pece of the writing wythout the hole circūstaūce, but that ye wyll deliberately conferre one place with an other, and then I doubte not but yf any sentence shall happen to be eyther obsurely or incircumspectly spoken, yet by the cōference of places ye shal perceiue the true meanynge and sense of the same. Certeynely as touchynge myne owne opinion in maters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the christen religion, I protest to all the worlde that as I submitte my selfe in all thinges to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and determination of the church, so I thynke it vnlawful for any man of his own priuate authoritie either to speake or wryte against the same. Yet I wol not deny, but mans infirmitie shal otherwhiles erre. Hierome, Ambrose, and Augustine were men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lernyng &amp; also holines, yet some faultes escaped them in their writinges. Yea saynt Austine openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted many thinges. Thys I dare say w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> saynt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n my writynges I may,<note place="margin">☜</note> but an heretique I can be none. For being ones admonished of my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, I wol not obstinately defend the same, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my selfe to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ingemēt of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church. Which I wold hartely wish that other wolde do y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same, Then these diuerse sectes of Anabaptistes, of sacramētaries, and of other heretiques shulde not thus swarme abrode. Then shulde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> christen church be in much more quiet then it is. Then shuld Christes religiō be more truly kepte, and Christe hym selfe better pleased wyth vs. Which thynge I beseche God, bryng to pas. Amen.</p>
