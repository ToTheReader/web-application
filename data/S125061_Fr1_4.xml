   <head>PETER RAMVS to the reader wisheth health.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>ARchymedes</hi> (O Reader) would have the reason of the spheares and clymates (in which invention he had more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured) ingraven upon his sepulchre. And truely shouldest thou aske me of my vigils, and studies, I desire a piller to be raysed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my grave from the instructions, of the art of Logicke. Touching the cause of the wish, they answer first to the accuratnes of the art, the bookes of invention of arguments, and their disposition to be iudged, not onely from <hi>Aristotle</hi> Organicall, Rhetoricall, Physicall, but from <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and so many Orators. In all which wee have strived with all studie &amp; diligence, by all reasonable wayes, to contract them briefly into these two books, that no particle, or the least shadow of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke might be there confused, whose truth might not bee expresly delivered. And this shall be first made knowne touching <hi>Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> his probleme. They answer secondly to the use of Logicke, the elegance and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all the parts to be explicated, to stirre
<pb facs="8"/>up logicall meditations, as well the popular phrases of Poets, Orators, Historiographers, as also the liberall and ingenuous ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es of a new body deliuered in a new forme to the studious, adorned with excellent indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and least any should feare least they should happen to be strangers, they are given and committed to the liberall custodies of their School<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s. This shall be secondly made knowne touching <hi>Archymedes</hi> his probleme. These therefore shall be witnesse of so many daies &amp; night watches, touching the truth &amp; vtility of Logicke, and shall answer for the cause of our wish, shall also admonish thee (reader) as I hope of I know not what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in most academies of Europe, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their sophisticall precepts, how that they are farre unlike both to the verity and vtility of Logicke, and shall also inflame thee to the study of the more true &amp; profitable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. But beside this there is obiected a great company, extructed with theatricall reproches, threatning paines of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iudgement, condemnation at the least of filthy ignorance and calumny, will thrust us from the whole kingdome of Philosophy as strange &amp; unheard of prescription, both with hands and tongue, whether will they forbid the small cause of our wish? what freedome
<pb facs="9"/>was obtained by King <hi>Henry</hi> from the envy of so mad a Iudge; to the more solide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a milder censurer? what afterward, (when this Logical ardor had set foot into the cause of religion) was a more great offence, the life and health of us being aimed at by those three civill warres? will these shew no cause of our wish? yea rather they doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, That we give great thankes to the almighty, who hath ayded and protected the course of our studyes hitherto, neither would suffer them by any meanes to be interrupted. Therefore I witnesse that this light of Logick will availe greatly to the studious in setting forth the truth, as also to adorne the ingenuous artes, as cheifly theillustrating the heavenly misteries of the sacred Doctrine: I pray that it may grow up more and more to these things, and and that this booke may be happily concluded to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD.</p>
