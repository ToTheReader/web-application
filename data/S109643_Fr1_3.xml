      </gap>sion (which costs so litle as our willes to haue it) and more vncharitable that would not do his best to assist his companiō in his iourny, with both counsell and comfort of the same. For this cause (gentle Reader) I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (through Gods great goodnesse) fels in the direction and
<pb facs="4"/>
protection of my vnstable youth, a plentifull portion of the wonderfull care he hath ouer vs, and of the vnspeakeable force of praier and thansgiuing in all extremities: the more to stirre vp my selfe to a memorie thereof, haue thought good to set downe these abrupt passions of my passed afflictions, as witnesses of the impediments most stopping me in my Christian pilgrimage, and testimonies of the meanes of my euasion hitherto, which may serue for presidents for my selfe in the like future occasions: and not be altogither vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for others to imitate. In which (as in a glasse) may be seene, the state of a regenerate soule, sicke with sinne, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (Agus-like) shiuering with cold dispaire, straight waies inflamed with seruencie of faith and hope. One while yeelding vnder the burthen of sinne to eternall death, and presently incouraged to runne cheerfully forward the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted course of this his pilgrimage, and like a practized trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, vsed to the change of companie, diet, heate, cold, paine, pleasure, plentie, and want, not to amaze himselfe long with anie chaunge: but by a consideration of pleasures passed or rest expected, patientlie to passe ouer this world full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comberances, from a sence and feeling wherof in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, no true childe of God is anie long time (as I suppose) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt. Now although I doubt not but euen these reasons will carrie the iudgement of the godlie Christian Reader to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable interpretation of my purpose herein, and to some delight in the tast thereof, to whom no person or occasion, stile or phrase, will seeme vnseasonable, being imployd to the glorifying of God, &amp; profit of the Church, or proceeding from a zeale of that effect: yet the consideration that the greater number to whose handes this Treatise may happen to come, are either not so well affected, or so discreet and temperate
<pb facs="5"/>
as were to be wished, maketh me thinke it needfull to saie something in declaration of my purpose herein: not in excuse of my exercising my self in such theames which indeed ought to be the common action in some measure of all men, as oft as necessarie affaires of this life will permit them, neither in that I make common with others this my exercise which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in secret onely to be practised by my selfe: for that I take it not to be alwaies a token of pride or vaine glorie, to make knowne for a common good to others, that which may breed a suspect of ambition in the Author among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or cauelling multitude, though how herein I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my selfe, I leaue to God the searcher of hearts to iudge: onely I would satisfie them first in the cause of my writing them in verse, then of the confused placing of them without speciall titles. To the first I was induced, for that I find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie oftentimes (speciallie such as had most neede to praie and meditate) to reade bookes rather for the affection of words then liking of matter, and perhaps more to controll the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling, then commend the contents, such yet (so as they read) shall giue me all that I craue, and find I hope that they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not for, if not in all, yet in some among manie of these Sonnets.

      </gap>sse, to the nature of passions, and common burner of men, who are either not long touched with so good motions, or by their worldly affaires not permitted to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue much reading; as for the cause of my so preposterous placing of them and deuision onely into two sorts, I confesse
<pb facs="5"/>
indeed I am perswaded their disorder doth best fit the nature of mankind, who commonly is delighted with contraries, and exercised with extreames, and also as they were by God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to my minde, to set downe by sundry accidents in my priuate estate and feeling; so I suppose my prouidence could not by a formall placing of them, so soone hit the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ctions of euerie Reader as Gods direction (by that which men call chaunce) might this way incounter the common inconstant forme of reading, which is by starts to turne ouer bookes, and peruse only, what by the praise of others told, is commended vnto them, or not sought for, falleth into their view. As they are therefore, I recommend them to thy curtesie in reading, and thee to Gods holie spirit in the perusing of them, if they may haue the same working in thee, that I praise God some of them had in me, they shall not be vtterly vnprofitable. If in matter they iumpe not to thy passions in all points, thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the great Arsenall of Satans armour, he hath choyce of weapons for sundry assaults, and disposeth of them diuersly according to the strength or weaknesse of the partie he besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. Which (being as indifferent in particular persons as Gods gifts are to them) thou shalt do well to thy abilitie to reforme or supply my defect, who hereby do onely inuite the better able to imploy in so fit a Theame their more fruitfull spirit. If in maner of the verse or stile, they be (as I doubt not) to be amended much: I do not greatly seeke the praise of a curious Architect or, neither (without neglect of more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie dutie) could I attaine to the required obseruances that way: and therefore craue that thy dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
