   <head>TO HIS MANY

friend Maister Robert Keysar.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, this vnfortunate child, who
in eight daies (as lately I haue
learned) was begot and borne
soone after, was by his parents
(perhaps because hee was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
his brethren) exposed to the
wide world, who for want of
iudgement, or not vnderstanding
the priuy marke of <hi>Ironie</hi> about
it (which shewed it was no of-spring of any vulgar
braine) vtterly reiected it: so that for want of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it was euen ready to giue vp the Ghost, and was in
danger to haue bene smothered in perpetuall obliuion, if
you (out of your direct <hi>antipathy</hi> to ingratitude) had not
bene moued both to relieue and cherish it: wherein I must
needs commend both your iudgement, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and singular loue to good wits; you afterwards sent
it to mee, yet being an infant and somewhat ragged, I
haue fostred it priuately in my bosome these two yeares,
<pb facs="3"/>
and now to shew, my loue returne it to you, clad in good
lasting cloaths, which scarce memory will weare out, and
able to speake for it selfe; and withall, as it telleth mee,
desirous to try his fortune in the world, where if yet it be
welcome, both father and foster-father, nurse and child,
haue their desired end. If it bee slighted or traduced, it
hopes his father will beget him a yonger brother, who
shall reuenge his quarrell, and challenge the world ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fond and meerely literall interpretation, or illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
misprision. Perhaps it will be thought to bee of the
race of <hi>Don Quixote:</hi> we both may confidently sweare,
it is his elder aboue a yeare; and therefore may (by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his birth-right) challenge the wall of him. I doubt
not but they will meet in their aduentures, and I hope the
breaking of one staffe will make them friends; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they will conbine themselues, and trauell through
the world to seeke their aduentures. So I commit him to
his good fortune, and my selfe to your loue.</p>
   <signed>Your assured friend
