   <head>The TRANSLATOR</head>
   <p>WIllingly I would omit this entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my Reader; for if he be onely a pretender to conception, hee will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to conceive me howsoever: If re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ingenious he needes no preparative, unlesse he be a Crittique, and then he deserves not any thing, because hee will bee satisfied with nothing. But <hi>Custome</hi> exacts <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and I pay my tribute, lest I should be thought proud or foolish, that I either would not, or could not give an account of my elections.</p>
   <p>That I pitched upon the <hi>Fourth Booke</hi> of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and singled it from the rest, was by such a Comands as (like coelestiall influences) did not violently inforce, but strongly incline my will:
<pb facs="5"/>
Reason assuring me, I might justifie my <hi>obedience,</hi> and quote <hi>Virgil</hi> for it; himselfe having first read to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> the <hi>Second, This,</hi> and the <hi>Sixt Booke;</hi> And so intire a worke I doe esteeme this Booke, as while it remaines solitary, I presume to: give it the Title of <hi>DIDO and AENEAS:</hi> wherein I prefixe her name, and would adde my reasons; but I imagine no man will quarrell with a Lady for place: much lesse with a <hi>Queene</hi> in her owne Kingdome.</p>
   <p>Opinion the common <hi>game</hi> that Muses fly at, hath not raised mine upon the wing. Of a noble <hi>Fame</hi> who covets not the purchase? it is a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some <hi>ayre,</hi> and breathes <hi>new spirits</hi> into a man; but mutable <hi>Opinion</hi> is <hi>winde,</hi> and I would not rashly carve Letters on a <hi>Wether-cocke:</hi> I write lower,
<pb facs="5"/>
therefore safer, couching my <hi>Name</hi> under the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Maro.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I will not offer to defend my <hi>Authour,</hi> that were to present <hi>succours</hi> to a <hi>Prince</hi> reigning in full <hi>peace,</hi> the Prince of the Latin Poets. If any should question him for the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>History,</hi> the verse is transparent, they may onely intend their sight, and looke quite through the <hi>Fained worke:</hi> and in the Founders of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> they shall read the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their <hi>Foundations,</hi> the <hi>Foeminine</hi> and <hi>Masculine</hi> governements of those two great Citties, by <hi>Merchandise,</hi> and <hi>Armes;</hi> And if it be a fiction that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ever saw <hi>Dido,</hi> it is true that <hi>Rome</hi> fell into the power of <hi>Carthage,</hi> till by a Faction growing in the bosome of this State, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
<pb facs="6"/>
like a love-sicke Lady, to trust it selfe in the armes and imbrace of <hi>Rome,</hi> that would seeme commanded by Fate to breake all mutuall tyes; till cursing the <hi>Roman</hi> false-hood, the reputation and spirit of poore <hi>Carthage</hi> glided into winde.</p>
   <p>In Englishing <hi>Virgil,</hi> I have given him a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not <hi>so low</hi> as to bring downe his <hi>Aeneis</hi> to his <hi>Eclogues,</hi> and levell the expressions of his Princes with his Shepheards: nor <hi>so high,</hi> that he should not be intelligible to the Vnlearned, as if he still spake <hi>Latin.</hi> It is true that wit distilled in one language, cannot be transfused into another without losse of spirits: yet I presume such graces are retained, as those of the Noblest quality will favour this <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,</hi> from an <hi>Original,</hi> that was somtimes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied Favorite of the greatest Roman Emperour.</p>
   <p>
