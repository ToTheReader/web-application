<pb facs="3"/>beseeme Princes, and noble men better thē books; who as they are the heades, and Gouernours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it agreeth with reason (if it were possible) that they should know all things: because, that as in the head, consist the senses, which gouerne, &amp; ruell the whole body; euen so in lyke maner, Princes &amp; Potētates, who are the heades &amp; Gouernours of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, &amp; other people, should be seen in all sciēces, and vertues, for the gouerning of others. For if the Planetes, which guyde, &amp; rule this inferior world, are replenished with greater influence of light, and vertue, then the other starres in the firmamēt, euen so are Princes, and Nobles, the planetes, &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this world, more illuminated with greater light of wisdome, knowledg, and power, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of others; that by the influēce of wisdome, &amp; knowledg in thē, wherwith they are replenished of God, they might ruell, and guyd others; for as Cyrus sayth, he is not worthy of any dignity, and authority, that is not better, then others: &amp; if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristole met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="3"/>which all mē naturally desyres to know, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therof is more proper specially to be in Noble Men, and Princes. And therefore seing your L. is one of these Princes, &amp; Noble men, in whom as in a planet consists the gouerning, and rulling of a most auncient family, and surename of Cambell, with the authority, and dominion, ouer the sherif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Argyll, and Tarbet, with the preeminent dignity, honour, &amp; power of an Earle, in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kingdome of Scotland: Whose wisdome, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and nobility, hath been the occasion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto your L. these my labours, lieuing vnder hope so to esteeme of them as well becometh your L.
