      <p> Verily the Sacraments which we receiue of the bodie and blood of
<pb facs="8"/> Christ are a diuine thing, by reason whereof, we also by them are made partakers of the diuine nature, <hi>and yet there ceaseth not to be the substance or nature of bread and wine.</hi> And surely an image or esem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the bodie and blood of Christ, is celebrated in the action of the mysteries. It is therefore euidently inough shewed vnto vs; that we must thinke the same in our Lord Iesus Christ, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, celebrate and receiue in his image, that as these (namely the bread and wine) do by the working of the holie Ghost passe ouer into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine substance, and yet continue in the proprietie of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so they shew that that principall mysterie, the efficiencie &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue wherof these do represent vnto vs, doth abide one Christ; because whole and true; those natures properly remaining, whereof he doth consist.</p>

Touching the words of S. <hi>Chrysostome: <hi>He would plucke vp by the rootes a certaine pernicious heresie of them which vse water in the Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi>
         </hi> Read the 32. Canon of the sixth Councell hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there you shall find vpon what occasion this golden mouth did vtter these words, and not only that, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so mention of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and S. <hi>Basils <hi>masse or sacrifice</hi>
         </hi> left to the church in writing. The words of the Canon begin thus: <hi>Because we know that in the country of the Armenians, wine onely is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the holie table, &amp;c.</hi> The heresie therefore against which he wrote was of the <note n="a" place="margin">Vntruth. For neither doth Chrysostome intimate any thing against the Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or such as vse wine only: neither was it heresie in thē that did so.</note>
         <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the <hi>Aquarians:</hi> the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would vse onely wine, the other onely water in the holie myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Against which vse being so directly against both the scriptures and custome of the primitiue church, he wrote the same which he saith of <hi>pernicious heresie,</hi> as before, I cannot doubt of your hauing the Councels or some of them.</p>
      <p>Your other booke conteining the words of <hi>Gelasius,</hi> I wil not yet
<pb facs="8"/> answere, being printed at <hi>Basil,</hi> where we suspect many good works to be corrupted &amp; abused.

      <head>A reply against the former answere to the places of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Gelasius.</hi>

      <p>THe willingnesse I haue to doe you good, M. <hi>Spence,</hi> I wish might take such effect with you, as that God might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by reuealing vnto you y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowledge of his truth. I doubt not but it shall be so, if you séeke it as you ought, and where you ought. Concerning the place of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> of vsing water in the Sacrament, I finde it expounded as you answere me, in <hi>Concil. Constantinopol 6. ca.</hi> 32. of them that vsed water onely and no wine. Albeit the wordes séeme to me plainly to enforce vpon the Reader another vnderstanding neither find I any reason why the Bishops of <hi>Armenia</hi> being a thousand vnder one Metropolitane, may not be thought as méete iudges of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> meaning, as the Bishops of this Councell; especially séeing it is not certaine either what
<pb facs="9"/> time or by whom those Canons were made, and appeare to be falsly fathered vpon the sixth generall Councell as <hi>Surius</hi> in his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Surius in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea and they are in diuers points reiected by your selues, as is plaine also by <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> both in the same Preface, and by some notes added to some of the Canons. But I contend not of that point, and as I condemne not in that respect the Churches which either haue vsed or doe vse that mixture, only without opinion of superstition and necessitie; so neither do I find reason why those Churches are to be condemned that rather follow as most assured the simplicitie of the institution of Iesus Christ, where we finde mention of the fruite of the vine, but nothing as touching water. If you say as the Canon saith, that <hi>this is to innouate those things which haue bene deliuered by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Cypri. epist. ad Pompeium.</note> I must answer you with <hi>Cyprians</hi> words; <hi>Whence is this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Whether descending from the authoritie of the Lord and of the Gospell, or comming from the Commandements and Epistles of the Apostles? for that those things which are written must be done, God testifieth, &amp;c. If therefore either it be commanded in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell or conteined in the Epistles and Acts of the Apostles, let this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be kept as holie.</hi> Now, séeing there is no testimony of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scripture to approue the necessitie of water, I take your wordes (<hi>directly contrary to the scriptures</hi>) to be vnderstood rather of those which vse water only contrarie to the text, then wine only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the expresse mention of the text. Your glose of the Canon<note place="margin">De consecra. dist. 2. cap. sicut in glossa.</note> law doth tell that <hi>Doctors haue said, that water is to be mingled in the cup only for honestie</hi> or decencie, and therefore not of necessitie to the Sacrament.

<pb facs="9"/> in the consecration, <hi>Anselmus</hi> answereth by likelihood that he did so, because in <hi>Palestina the maner is to mingle water with their wine.</hi> Now if it were done <hi>according to the maner of that country,</hi> then it was done to abate the strength of the wine and not for any such my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie as some haue imagined. In manie Countries where their wines are verie strong, temperate &amp; sober men vse to qualifie and delaie the heate thereof by mingling water, least it should cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distemperature to the bodie. And this the Gréeke Churches may séeme to haue respected who consecrated with méere wine, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </gap>chites</hi> his spéech in the conference aboue-named; as also by some editions of <hi>Chrysostomes <hi>Liturgie,</hi>
         </hi> and afterwardes put in water when it was to be administred to the receiuers. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which they vsed for not adding water before, was this, <hi>because Christ is not read to haue added water;</hi> which accordeth with the words of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> alleaged by me. But as I said before, I stand not vpon this point. Only I pray you to consider an argument of <hi>Bertram</hi> in his booke <hi>de corpo. &amp; sangui. domini. ad Carol imperat.</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Bertram. de corpo. &amp; sang. domini.</note> his ground from this mixture. <hi>Water,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beareth the image of the people. Therefore if the wine sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the seruice of the Ministers, be bodily turned into the blood of Christ, then the water also which is mingled withall, must needs be bodily or substantially turned into the blood of the beleeuing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For where there is one sanctification there is consequently one working or effect, and where there is the like reason, there followeth also the like mysterie. But we see in the water there is nothing turned bodily. Consequently therefore in the wine there is nothing bodily shewed. It is taken spiritually whatsoeuer is signified in the water as touching the bodie of the people. It must needes therefore be taken spiritually whatsoeuer is signified in the wine concerning the blood of Christ.</hi> Which words amongst other, it hath pleased those honest Censours of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> appointment, to exempt from being<note place="margin">Index Exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="10"/> of that melancholy <hi>Athenian,</hi> who standing at the sea shore would imagine of euery ship that he saw that it was his ship. For in like sort whersoeuer you finde in any of the auncient Fathers mention made of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mysticall sacrifice, you fancy it straight waies to be ment of your sacrilegious &amp; abhominable sacrifice of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Masse: a cursed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of Satan therby to withhold men from the soueraign &amp; only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the crosse of Christ.

But <hi>Missa</hi> importeth not sacrifice as you pretend it doth. The olde vse of the word <hi>Missa,</hi> discloseth the great abuse of your Masse.

         </hi> There is no such dimission in your Masse, and of those that staie, none are ordinarily partakers of the Sacrament, but only the Priest.

Whence it is that the pretended Liturgies of S. <hi>Iames, Basil,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> are by the translators tearmed by the name of Masse. Whereas those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, I doubt not, if they were written by those men whose names they beare, as some of them assuredly were not, or if being written by them they remained as their Authors left them, as by the varietie of the editions of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Liturgie it is plain they do not, would rather resemble our communion wherein both the Minister and the people communicate togither in both kinds, then your Masse wherein the people are either idle lookers on, or when they are communicants, are by your sacriledge communicants in one kinde onely, and secluded from the other; contrary altogither to the practise of the primitiue Church, or which is more, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse institution of our Sauiour Christ. And this is to be séene by those steps of antiquitie which as yet are found in those Liturgies: neither do I sée what great aduantage you haue by them to set any colour vpon your Popish Masse, saue only to blinde the eyes of the simple and vnlearned. And whereas you alledged to me that there was in them praier for the dead, there is good cause to thinke that those praiers were at the first but commemorations and thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings for the departed in the faith of Christ; for that in <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Liturgie we finde, according to that which then I answered you, thus: <hi>We offer vnto thee, ô Lord, this reasonable seruice for those</hi>

As, said he, the bread and wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blessing are one thing, but after the blessing become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are changed: so the bodie or humanitie of Christ whereby he was truly man before, is after-his ascension &amp; glorification chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the substance of God.

         <hi>which indeed he hath giuen immortalitie, but hath not taken away the nature thereof.</hi> If <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For he might and would haue said, that as the bread and wine in the sacrament after consecration do leaue their former substance, and are changed into another, so the bodie of Christ, although it were first a true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie, yet after his ascension and glorification was chaunged into another nature and substance of the Godhead. <hi>A meete couer</hi>
         <note place="margin">cyp. de caena domini.</note>
         <hi>for such a cup.</hi> You may remember that I shewed you how <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth exemplifie the matter of the sacrament, by the diuinitie &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of Christ, that as Iesus Christ though truly God, yet was not letted thereby to be truly man; so the sacrament though it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie sacramentally not only the vertue &amp; power, but also the truth of the bodie and blood of Christ, yet is not therby hindered from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in it the substance and nature of bread &amp; wine. And as Christ was <hi>changed in nature,</hi> not by leauing his former nature of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but by taking to him the nature of man, so bread and wine were <hi>chaunged in nature</hi> not by leauing their former nature &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but by hauing vnited vnto them by the working of the holie Ghost in such maner as I haue said, the substance and effect of the bodie and blood of Iesus Christ.</p>
      <p>But you cannot sée how the words of Christ, <hi>This is my bodie, &amp;c.</hi> can be vnderstood otherwise but of your Transubstantiation. There is, M. <hi>Spence,</hi> a veile of preiudice lying before your heart, which blindeth your eyes that you cannot sée it.

         <hi>Christ hath commended vnto vs in this Sacrament his body &amp; blood, which also he made vs to be; and by his mercy we are that which we do receiue:</hi> yet we are not transubstantiated into the bodie &amp; blood of Christ.

         <note place="margin">De consecr. dist 2. cap. species.</note>
         <hi>that is, the forgiuenesse of sinnes.</hi> We adde somewhat to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, when we teach in the Sacrament a true and effectuall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of vs to the bodie of Christ, whereby he dwelleth in vs and we in him, he is one with vs and we with him, whereby as he hath taken vpon him what is ours, sinne and death: so he yéeldeth vnto vs what is his, righteousnesse and euerlasting life. Which vnion with Christ is wrought in all those, and in those only which do with true and liuely faith receiue these holie mysteries: where as that Capernaitish eating and drinking of Christs bodie and blood which your doctrine yéeldeth, is common to all gracelesse and prophane persons; that I say nothing of those monstrous, blasphemous, and horrible conceits which some of your captaines haue fallen into by
<pb facs="17"/> defence thereof.</p>
      <p>But yet further you alleage the vniformenesse of the wordes of Christ in the Euangelists <hi>Mat. Mar. Luc.</hi> And in S. <hi>Paul, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. all saying: <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> wheras the scripture where it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not a thing literally doth vary in the vttering of it. Which you speake vppon the warrant of some <hi>Allen,</hi> or <hi>Parsons,</hi> or Seminarie reader telling you so and you haue beléeued it. But they haue decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you, both in the on &amp; and in the other. For in the like matter you shall find in <hi>Moses</hi> law by an vniforme and constant spéech, that the sacrifices of the law are called <hi>expiations, propitiations and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for sinne,</hi> which were not so indéed, but they were so called sacramentally, because they were types and figures, seales and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the true attonement which should be wrought by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheading of our Lord Iesus. Again, if you had looked in S. <hi>Luke</hi> and<note place="margin">Luc 22. 20. 1. cor. 11. 25.</note> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> you should haue found the words, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by such maner of spéech as tendeth directly to the ouerthrow of your transubstantiation. For there it is said; <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my blood, &amp;c</hi> where I hope you will not say, that the cup is transubstantiated into the Testament, but that the wordes must be figuratiuely vnderstood. Then you must say, that the cup, that is, the outward and visible element of wine deliuered in the cup, is the seale of the new Testament &amp; couenant of grace, which is dedicated and established by the bloodsheading of Iesus Christ: by which seale we haue assurance offered vnto vs to be partakers through Christ of those benefits which God hath promised vnto the faithfull in the same Testament; the summe whereof is set downe by the Prophet <hi>Ier, 31. 32, &amp;c.</hi> Now if any man should take it thus:<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 32.</note>
         <hi>This cup,</hi> that is, this my blood in the cup is the new Testament in my blood, your selfe would say, he spake foolishly and absurdly.</p>
      <p>Thus therefore your collections from the text are no collections. Some of your owne side, no meane men, haue confessed indéed that transubstantiation cannot be enforced by the words of the text. In truth it cannot. God open your eyes that you may sée his truth and subdue the affections of your heart, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you may yéeld vnto it. By that litle spéech which I haue had with you, I perceiue you are too too far in loue with that whoore of <hi>Rome.</hi> She flattereth you, and maketh shew of goodly names, and pretendeth great deuotion, as the harlot in the <hi>Prouerbes: <hi>I haue peace offeringes; to day haue I paide my</hi>

I shewed you the expresse testimonies of the Fathers, gainsaying her as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bookes of Canonicall scriptures: but you thinke she may approue them for Canonicall which were not so with the Fathers. I declared the impudencie of the Rhemish glosers, in auouching the storie of the assumption of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> controlled by their owne computation of yeares. But because the Roomish harlot hath approued this fable, and the Rhemists do but sooth her in that which she hath affirmed, you will, rather then y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And when it shall be saide vnto them, Why say you so? what are your trespasses; Let them answere: because no man liuing shall be iustified in thy sight:</hi> but you beléeue because your loue hath told you so, that men are by the righteousnesse and merits of workes to be iustified in the sight of God.</p>
      <p>Take héede, M. <hi>Spence,</hi> deceiue not your selfe. There is but one heauen and one faith that bringeth thither. God only hath reuealed that faith. Séeke it there where he hath reuealed it. Your ground
<pb facs="18"/> is now only vppon men: yet neither will Popery stand vppon that ground, if you tie not your selfe to your new builders. Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> amongst others, hath detected the vanitie of their building in many points. But you say that one <hi>Steuens</hi> beyond the sea, declared his bad dealing in his writing to that purpose. But were you so simple to credit what <hi>Steuens</hi> said? Doe you not know that many when they come to your Seminaries will haue some what to say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to commend themselues and to discredit vs, and therefore when they want truth, must néeds coyne lies? One alleaged to me when I was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> how <hi>Iewell</hi> had falsified a place out of <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas.</hi> He spake it by heare-say as you do. I went into a Library of verie auncient cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>es, and found it word for word as it was cited. It was maruell that M. <hi>Harding</hi> could not finde that kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It would haue giuen him good matter for a far more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall answere. But I might as well vpon report tell you that <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> perplexed in mind néere his death, wished that his soule might haue place with Bishop <hi>Iewels</hi> soule. I haue heard that <hi>Hart</hi> the Iesuite being demanded thereof in the Tower, could not make any great deniall of it. But the truth lieth not in these matters. As for Bishops <hi>Iewels</hi> writings, I will lend you the booke if it please you. It were maruell that no sillable or sentence should be mistaken in that multitude of allegations, the sight whereof troubled M. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> minde, as I conceiue by the Preface of his fond detection; but for the substance of the cause, and iustifying the points defended, I will vndertake to make good vnto you the allegations, for so many of the auncient Fathers as I haue, and some of the principall you know I haue, and can quickly get more. And what I haue here written, I will be readie to approue vnto you, and to make plaine whatsoeuer is here for want of conuenient leisure briefly, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps obscurely collected. The God of peace guide vs in the way of peace, and graunt vs to know his truth, and to perseuere in the knowledge thereof vnto the ende.</p>
