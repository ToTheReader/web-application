      <pb facs="5"/>From this his modest, and humble charity (vertues which rarely cohabite with the swelling windenesse of much knowledge) issued this spisse and dense, yet polished; this copious, yet concise; this concise yet cleare and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Treatise of the variety of Languages and Religions through the chiefe regions of the world. <note n="a" place="margin">

The falsehood of which glorious boastings are in part most liuely discouered in this learned Tractate, describing the diuers conditions of Christians in the East, North and Southerne Regions of the earth which haue no subordination vnto the Papall Hierarchie, but not in the <hi>West,</hi> where Protestantes haue cheifely their aboade; and therefore to make it a more compleate worke, it will not be amisse compendiously to declare their multitudes, amplenesse, and seuerall habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this <hi>Europaean</hi> world.</p>

   <p>
      <hi>Neare</hi> adioyning vnto these three last Dukedomes, are those Prouinces of the low Countries gouerned by the States, namely <hi>Zutphen, Vtrech, Oberyssel, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham, Holland, Zeland, West-frizland,</hi> in which onely Protestants haue the publicke (for otherwise <hi>Arrians, Anabaptists, Socinians</hi> are here priuately tolerated) and free exercise of their Religion, as also in the neighbour dominion of the Earle of East-<hi>Freezland.</hi>

<pb facs="10"/>
rending that wombe wherein they were new borne by the lauer of Regeneration, forgetfull of their heauenly embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, which is not onely to reconcile men vnto God, but men with men, so farre neglecting their owne eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as to be vnmindfull of that most vndoubted truth, <hi>He that is not in charity, is in death,</hi> trampling vnder foote that glorious legacie of their Lord and Maister, <hi>My peace I giue vnto you, my peace I leaue with you,</hi> haue in heat of contention, and bitternesse of their soules strained and racked their weake vnderstandings, to make differences betweene themselues, euen in the maine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, and branded one another with blasphemy, and heresie, yet these vnchristian and vncharitable dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are not to be imputed to the whole sacred community of Orthodox Churches, whose harmony and agreement in necessary points of Faith, are onely to be esteemed by their confessions which by publicke authority they haue diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto the world.</p>
   <p>How many are the differences both in doctrine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline betweene the Proctors for the Papall faction, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Discipline? some teach their cheefetaine the Pope may erre, others that he cannot: some that he is subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Generall Councell, others that hee is aboue it: some that all Ecclesiasticall authority is immediately in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church, others that it is onely in the Pope, and from him deriued vnto inferiour Bishops: some that he hath temporall authorities ouer Princes, others not; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning doctrine, some at firme that predestination both by grace, and glory is meerely from Gods free pleasure, others from foreseene desert and merit, some that all the bookes or part of them belonging vnto the old Testament which
<pb facs="11"/>
were not in the Canon of the Iewish Church are Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, others canonicall euen in the matters of Faith: some that there is no originall sinne inherent in vs, but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, others that it is both inherent and imputed: some that wee are most freely iustified, by the meanes of Faith, Hope, &amp;c. others by the value, and merit of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: some that faith is onely a generall assent vnto diuine truths, others that it is a speciall perswasion touching the remission of our sinnes through Christ, some that wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare righteous in Gods sight, partly through imputed, partly through inherent righteousnesse, others onely by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent: some that eternall life is due vnto our works onely by vertue of Gods free and gratious promise, others through the merit of the worke done: some that all the morall good works of Infidels, and Ethnicks are sinnes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they are without sinne; some that the B. Virgin was conceiued without originall sinne, others the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that with such eagernesse, that the one condemne the other of heresie: yet because these contentions are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene priuate men, and they all (in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> but not in <hi>France,</hi> as hath beene (hewed) accord in the cheefe points of doctrine publiquely established in the Councell of Trent, they boast much of their vnity.</p>
   <p>Although then some priuate men vnworthy to take the word of peace and reconciliation into their virulent and contentious mouthes, led more by passion, and their owne selfe-pleasing conceipt, then by the sacred rules of truth, and piety, haue laboured to sow the tares of dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the vineyard of the Lord, and heereby haue made crooked some few branches cleauing vnto them: yet the generall societies of Orthodox Churches in the publicke
<pb facs="11"/>
confessions of their faith, doe so agree, that there is a most sacred harmony betweene them in the more substantiall points of Christian Religion necessary to saluation.</p>
   <p>This is manifest out of the confessions themselues, which are these, the Anglicane, the Scotiane, French, Heluctian former, and later, the <hi>Belgie, Polonie, Argentine, Augustane, Saxonicke, Wirtenbergicke, Palatine, Bohemicke or Weldensian</hi> confession: for there is none of the Churches formerly pointed out in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Europe which doth not embrace one of these confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and all of them harmoniously conspire in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Articles of Faith, and which neerest concerne our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall saluation; as in the infallible verity and full suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Scriptures, diuine essence and vnitie of the euerlasting Godhead, the sacred Trinitie of the three glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons, the blessed incarnation of Christ, the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent prouidence of God, the absolute supreame head of the Church, Christ, iustification by Faith through Christ, and the nature of a liuely faith, repentance, regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sanctification, the difference betweene the Law, and the Gospell, touching freewill, sinne, and good works, the Sacraments their number and vse, the notes of the Church, the diuine authority of Magistrates, the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and state of soules after death.</p>
   <p>And for the cheefe point of difference which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be betweene the professors of the Gospell about the presence of Christ in the sacred Eucharist; such as are parties in this contention ingenuously confesse, that <hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipsa, touching the thing it selfe there is no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō but only we varie in some ordinances, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the thing. We agree</hi> reipsa, <hi>in the
<pb facs="12"/>
matter it selfe, although we differ according to the diuersity of Gods gifts in expressing aptly and cleerely what we conceiue concerning this matter. We all acknowledge that the holy Symboles, or signes, are not</hi> inanes significationes, <hi>barely significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but what by diuine institution they represent and testifie vnto our soules, is as truly and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered vnto vs from God as the symboles themselues. But the question is, whether as the signe with the thing signified is presēt in respect of our body, and not rather in regard of our well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it by faith. Moreouer, whether as both the signe, and thing signified are exhibited to all, so all receiue both, some to life, others to their perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that wee all beleeue the true communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true body and bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, onely concerning the manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is the controuersie. But who can rightlie iudge that for this the sacred vnion and fellowship of Churches, is to be dissolued.</hi>

   <p>There being so excellent a foundation and firm ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of vnity betweene the Protestants, how worthy a worke would it be for Christian Princes to imitate the professors of the Gospell in the kingdome of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and by a generall Assembly of moderate, and vnpartiall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and sensible of the bleeding wounds religion receiueth by sects, and discords, make vp the ruines and breaches of Churches, caused hitherto through priuate contention, &amp; to sement them together (if it shall please God out of the riches of his mercy to prosper their heroicall and religious endeauours) with an euerlasting bond of concord.
