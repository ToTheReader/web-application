   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Appendix, when first published by the Author, contained only some briefe quotations, vpon seuerall points of difference, betweene us and the Papistes; showing that the nowe Romish faith, was neuer ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiued in the VVesterne or Latine Church, in the dayes of our Fathers; no not then, when the darke mist of Poperie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue ouershadowed all things. The Author not long before he died, intended an inlargment of it, in the seuerall particulars; but being preuented by death, liued not to finish what hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. So much as was finished of it comming to my hands, I thought my selfe bound in duty not to depriue the world of. I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so farre aduentured to hazard the credit of the Author, as to make it publique, though something imperfect, and wanting that lustre, and beauty, which it might haue receiued from the last hand of the Author, if God had lent him longer life. As it is, it may serue, if for no other vse, yet for this, as a platforme to shew, what might be done in this kind and what the Author intended. I make no question but a fauourable Reader will looke on it, as wee vse to looke on the foundations of stately buildings, the finishing whereof hath beene hindred by some fatall accident; the very ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines whereof breede in us astonishment and amazement, while we consider, not what they are, but what they might haue beene. The twelue first chapters of this Appendix are enlarged, the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as they were formerly set forth. The quotations contained in that part which hath beene added, I haue compared and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if any where they differed, from the Originalls whence they were taken: and the truth of them I am able to iustifie. If the world shall reape any benifit by the worke, or if I may be thought by my paines bestowed on it, to haue performed that duty, wich I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the memorie of a deare father, I haue my desire, and so I rest.</p>
