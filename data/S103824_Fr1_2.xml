   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He feate of iugling and deluding the people by counterfeyt miracles, hath been as auncient, as it hath beene too-currant in all nations of the world, wherein the Egyptians were growne so expert, that their sect of inchanters durst challenge God his embassador in working of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vntill they were shamefully foyled at making of Lyce. As these were mated by a silly vermine, so the rable of <hi>Bell</hi> his priestes tooke as foule a fall, whose grosser wits could deuise no better way to purchase an opinion of deitie to their God of flies, then by fayning, that his omnipotencie lay in infinite eating, pretending that his Godhead was able to consume as much in a night, as two hundred men. These had a publike ayme, the countenancing of false religion, by a face of deitie, falsly drawne vpon stockes and stones, for a priuate end of a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. We haue a notable president in the Arch-iugler <hi>Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi> the drift of whose feyned miracles in bewitching the people, was to be reputed <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> a wonderfull man, and to be pointed at with this <hi>Euge,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; this man is the power of Almighty God. Adde vnto these, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> his fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nimph, <hi>Socrates</hi> his Genius, <hi>Sertorius</hi> his Hynde, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> false conceyted Doue, we shall find the tract of all miracle-mongers to bend to one of these two endes: eyther gracing of false religion by this graceles feate, or the raising of their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="3"/>
in the opinion of the people. The great Impostor of <hi>Rome,</hi> maister of this facultie, hath so led the world in a string, by this Legerdemaine: bewitching by his counterfeyte miracles, the mindes of the ignorant, giuen to adore al, that they doe not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the weakenes of their sense, as he doth now proclame by one of his Herauldes with open mouth. <hi>Nemo vnquam haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum miraculum edidit:</hi> none but he and his schollers can cogge a miracle kindlie, and hee and his Priestes can dispatch a miracle as easily as a squirrell can cracke a nutte: a miracle in the bread, a miracle in the wine, a miracle in holy water, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in holy oyle, a miracle in our Ladies milke, a miracle in the asses tayle, a miracle in Lampes, candles, beades, breeches, ragges, bones, stones, <hi>omnia stultorum &amp; miraculorum plena,</hi> nothing done in his religion without a miracle and a Vice. And that which passeth all, the least bone of a canonized Saint, (traitor Sainct Campion forsooth), hath more force in it sometimes to cast out a Legion of Deuilles, then the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, then prayer, fasting, inuocation of the Trinitie, Exorcising, coniuring, and Maries reliques, Crosse, holy water, and all. And would to God the Pope could vaunt of this tricke alone, that none but hee and his were seene in this mistery: and that there were not risen vppe amongst vs schollers, not out of his schoole, but of his occupation as touching this point, who, (vpon what ayme, <hi>I</hi> leaue to God &amp; their conscience, such as it is), whether vpon <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to seeme to be great in the peoples eyes: or the enchanters pride, to crosse God his gouernors in the church, who professe not this prettie feate: or the Bellites conceit, to grace an idoll of their owne idle braynes: or of an impious simplicitie, holding it lawful to lye, cogge, and fayne, so as it bee to a good ende, and (as their fauourites tearme it) to the glorie of God, haue taken vpon them to bee deepely seene in this misterie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles. And one especially aboue the rest, hath played his publike prize in this iugling science, casting out more deuils by prayer and
<pb facs="3"/>
fasting after a good dinner, perhappes at after nooone, then wee reade that euer any of the Apostles at so full a season did. Which being now discouered to be but a pure play, containing two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts, of a vice and a deuill, there hath beene deuised two miserable shiftes to helpe him off the stage, that he might not be hissed at of all the world. One, that this action (like the day of iudgement acted on a stage) though fayned in it selfe, yet procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red reuerence and feare in the simpler and looser sort, whilest the imaginary Deuilles seemed to stand in such awe of the worde of God: the other, that to cast out a Deuill, is no such great matter, as men make account of, being but <hi>mirandū &amp; nō miraculum,</hi> in the nature of a wonder, and not of a miracle. The former is borrowed from a Champion of the Popes, who to vphold the shop of his forgeries and lies in an Apologeticall treatise: sticketh not to affirme this impious rule: <hi>honesta docendi ad pietatem nunquam potest esse ratio inhonesta:</hi> So as a mans meaning be good and religious, it skils not, though his meanes be bad and impious. A singular foundation to vphold the Pope his play-house, and to make religion a pageant of Puppittes. It was peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the first, a supposed good entent to deuise the fearefull fire of Purgatory, the least sparkle whereof, is of more tormenting force, then all the fiers that be in the world: that men might bee more feareful, of committing small sinnes. And so likewise the painting of Almighty God like an ancient Philosopher, with a graue long beard, and a booke in his hand, that the boyes might haue a reuerend impression of his fatherlike wisedom: voluntary pouerty whippings, pilgrimages, images, worshipping of reliques, and adoration of the Crosse, and the blessed Budget of all the Pope his pedlary &amp; trash, is blanched ouer with as faire a face of good intent to the glorie of God, as this iugling mistery of casting out deuils. Open but this creuise in the dore of the church, that ill may be done to any good end: you shal haue religion like a <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Ilias,</hi> a fardle of fictions, &amp; a bundle of lies. God is truth, &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>
will be worshipped in spirit and truth: all falshood and forgerie are of the Deuill, and as opposite to truth, and consequently vnto God, as death vnto life, and darknesse vnto light. Saint <hi>Austine</hi> his resolution is of so high a pitch in this point,<note place="margin">Ad Crescē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium cap 4.</note> as he saith plainly it is not lawfull to dissemble for the safetie of a mans soule. And the heathen Philosopher in the fourth of his Ethickes, speakes better Christianitie in this case, then our iugling diuines <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> a lie is simply bad, and simplie to be condemned.</p>
   <p>The second shift is as silly as this is sinfull, that to cast out a Deuill is but a wonder, and not in the nature of a miracle in deed. What dull conceites had the rulers of the Iewes, that they could not see this slie sillie shift, to depraue the miracles of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, and to tell the people there was no iust cause they should belieue, that our Sauiour was the sonne of God, in doing such mightie miracles among them: the chiefe one whereof was casting out Deuilles, by reason that action was but <hi>Mirandum &amp; non miraculum▪</hi> a strange thing for silly people to wonder at, and not a miracle to enforce them to belieue. But they not able to denie the euidence of the miracle, put it vpon <hi>Belzebub,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it was done by the Prince of the Deuilles. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour pointing at the hand that did the deed, telles them that it was no other power then the finger of Almighty God: secluding both the arme of nature, and helpe of the Deuill, from this diuine action. And if our Deuill-stingers can point out a finger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the finger of God, and challenge as good interest in it, as our Sauiour Christ did, or his Apostles, they shall easily obtain the credite of effecting a miracle. There is a place in the last of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> wherein they mightily please themselues, and taking it as a rod of defence to maintaine their cause, it proues in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a serpent that deuoureth them vp. The words are these: <hi>These signs shal follow thē that belieue in my name: they shall cast out deuils, and shal speake with new tongues, &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>
shall take away serpents, and if they shall drinke any dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it shall not hurt them, they shall lay their handes vppon the sicke, and they shall recouer.</hi> Foelix quem faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt &amp;c. I doubt not but they are wise enough to keep themselues warme, and to deny ioyning issue out of this place, but rather take example from a giddie brother of theirs, who concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a warrant out of these wordes for proofe of certaine brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke conclusions, that hee helde, made this his issue, that if hee tooke downe Rattes-bane, and it did him no hurt, that then his positions should bee receiued as the Oracles of God: which hee doing accordingly, and for a little time, not feeling any harme to insue, was rauished with a wonderfull iollitie of this his strange tryall. But his pittifull Metamorphosis was as quick and strange: for as soone as the poyson came neere vnto his hart, he roared, yelled, and raged exceedingly, and in this miserable torment ended his life. VVe will not be so hard taskmaisters, as to put them to this tryall for their extraordinarie gifts, but will set them vp an easier rest. Let them with all their iugling driue out a melancholicke spirite, out of any poore soule in Bedlame, let them lay their handes vpon those that are troubled with the dropsie, sciatike, or the gowt: let them recouer sight to the blind, or limmes to the lame, and wee will giue eare vnto their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that scripture. But if they bee vnfaithfull in those lesser mites, who will trust them in matter of their greater treasures? These giftes are acknowledged by the fathers, to haue shined in the Apostles time, and in some fewe ages after the Apostles: but alwaies with this note, as the learned hold, <hi>in ijs qui dono mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculorum claruerunt,</hi> in such as were euidently indued with the gifte of working miracles. Touching the nicenesse of the difference betweene <hi>Mirandum</hi> &amp; <hi>miraculum,</hi> both tearmes spring from one roote of wonder or maruell: an effect which a thing strangely done doth procure in the minds
<pb facs="5"/>
of the beholders, as being aboue the reach of nature and reason: and not onely God his supernaturall actes done in the lande of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are called maruailes and wonders, but one and the selfe acte done by the finger of God, hath diuers and sundry names giuen it in diuers and sundrie considerations. Christ his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the <hi>4.</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> are generally called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as being significations of his omnipotent power. His miracle in the <hi>5.</hi> of <hi>Luke,</hi> shewed vpon the man taken with the palsie, is called by the multitude that beheld it, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, because it extended the compasse of their conceit. In the <hi>8.</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Christ his deedes are called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, for their power in amazing the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and sences: and so <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as causing men to gaze: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as procuring wonder: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, for the excellencie of their cause: and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, for their wonderfull effect: and the very same names that are giuen by the holy Ghost to the actes of Christ, effected by the onely finger of God, are attributed to false prophets in the <hi>13.</hi> of <hi>Marke,</hi> and to Antichrist himselfe in the second of the second to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, in all power and signes and wonders. And therefore, whether they iuggle vnder the colour of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, the feate is alike, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite all one. Thus much for a taste of Deuill-driuers legerdemaine: open the curtaine, and see their Puppettes play.</p>
