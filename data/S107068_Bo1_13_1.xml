But whyle I was on hande with this translacion, Master Iohn Olde a man of ryght good learnynge and my very frende, brought vnto me the paraphrase of Erasmus of Roterdame vpon saincte Paules, Epistle to Titus, the whiche I had certaineyeares gone translated into englyshe, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that I woulde peruse it againe, and amende suche faultes as were therin eyther by the printers neglygence or myne ouersyght.

And he shewed me also that as the first tome or volume of the same paraphrase vpon y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> gospelles and actes of the Apostles was all readye printed, so was the printer nowe about to go on hande with the seconde tome, that is to wyte the paraphrase vpon the Epistles of saincte Paule and the other Apostles.

And besyde▪ I haue so annexed the paraphrase to the texte, that the readers shall (I trust) easyly atteyne therby to the true vnderstandynge of saincte Paules mynde.
