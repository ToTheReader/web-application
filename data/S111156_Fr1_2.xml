Bucer, and maister D. Peter Martyr touching this controuersie, hath alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bene set forth and published, It is
<pb facs="3"/> therefore thought good also to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in print the sayde iudgement of Maister Bullinger, being a man singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly well learned and Godly, and a worthy Minister in Christes Church, not doubting but that muche good shall insue thereof, both to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of weake cōsciences troubled about this matter, and also to the satisfaction of those which without contention or affection seeke only the truth of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in this behalfe.</p>
