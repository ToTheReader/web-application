   <head>¶To the Right Honorable
Thomas Skinner, Lord Mayor
of the City of London.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been, and is (right
Honorable) a lawdable
custome in this Citie, that
at the entring of any Lord
Maior into his Office, not
onely his familiar friends
and acquaintance, but also
of euery fraternitie, some selected men should
present his Lordship with one gift or other:
Whereby they do not only congratulate with
him his late increase of honor; but also those
presents are as tokens, or earnest pence of
their yeelding dutie and obedience vnto his
Lordship, during his office. In like sort, I my
selfe (though one of the poorest, yet a Citizen,
and none of the least, in humble obedience,
and dutifull good meaning towardes your
honor, am imboldened to present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb facs="3"/>
with this Booke, intituled, <hi>A rich Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
or Treasury for the Diseased,</hi> A Booke
(Right Honorable) very necessary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to bee vsed of the poorer sorte of
people (for the preseruation of their health)
that are not of abilitie to go to the Phisitions,
and I assuring my selfe, that your Lordship
will vouchsafe to be a protector of the poore
peoples profit and good, both in health and
wealth, (the same comming by chaunce into
my hands) haue thought it good to publish it
vnder your honorable name, whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may best countenance the same, and
whose curteous admittance shall be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
guerdon of my dutifull good meaning
heerein. If my worth were greater, my dutie
would shew greater: in the meane time,
as it is, it is bound to your Lordship,
To whome I wish long life,
still lengthened with
all happinesse.</p>

      <signed>Your Lordships in all duty
