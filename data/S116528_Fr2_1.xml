   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue receaued the Apologie you sent me as a token of your auncient good vvill continued tovvards me, and a signe that you are not forgettfull of me, for the vvich I yeld you most hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thankes, earnestly requesting your vvor. to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevve the same courtuous good vvill still tovvards him, that vvill not be forgetfull thereof, nor omitt any occasion to acknovvledge and requite it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my poore habilitie. And in fevv vvords to tell you the truth, the booke vvas at the first vvell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, as nevv thinges ordinarily are to all men But vvhen I had read it ouer, it vtterlye misliked me, for the causes you may see in this discours anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed. Truth it is, as your vvour coniectured, I had the other bookes, but not sent me by any of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vvith vvhom I neuer had any dealing or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse of vvriting, but out of Ingland from one
<pb facs="45"/>vvho vvith the rest acknovvledged the Archpriest at his first institution. He sent them vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>In August last N. N. (vvho passed by you) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occasion to goe into Ingland I dealt vvith him to goe dovvne into my countrey to see vvhither my friend vveare liuing or no, and to bring me certeine nevves thereof. He seeeng theis bookes vpon his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and telling him that they vvere nouellties in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se contreys, he sent them to me by him: and so rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them in Septembre last, vvhen I had read them curssorely ouer, I threvv then in a corner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinking to look on them againe (so vnpleasant are contentious bookes vnto me) but hauing receaued this Apologie and conferred them together, I began to perceiue vvhat the grovvnde and substance vvas of this sandalous controuersie, the vvhich before I neglected and cared not for. And findinge this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie to be vvritten rather to augment then to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the contentions, and perceuinge that the others vvent simply to vvorke, in setting dovvne truly &amp; simply the causes of theese controuersies, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologye to flye as from a serpent the true causes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. And beside seeing the chief hedd of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, to depende vpon a pointe of lavve, I could not hold my hand, but vvas driuen in recompence of the booke you sent me, to send you these pointes vvherin I mislike the Apologie, and vvherin they
<pb facs="45"/>ought to haue satisfied (as they do not) their frendes and readers. I hope in reading it vvithout affection you shall perceaue vvho those be that</hi> Sibi impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare debent, qui causam dederunt, quique illi sunt, <hi>as you note of our holy Martyr S. Thomas, &amp; vpon them the</hi> vae illis <hi>&amp;c. is like in thend to fall. For my part I mislike vvith the discontēted brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for one thing, vvith the Iesuites for</hi> 2. <hi>thinges: vvith the Archpriest for as many: and vvith the Apologie for a great nomber of faults it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as by this discourse is made euident. VVith the discontented pristes, not for vvriting, for it vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for them so toe doe, bicause it stood vpō their honor, honestie and credite: but for vvritting as they did hardly both of the vvhole societie, and of diuers particular Fathers and priests. If they had kept thē selues vvith in the compas of their matter in the latin booke to his Hol: as they did in the latin booke to the Inquisitors: the Apologie maker must haue held his peace for any aduantage he could haue had against them. The first fault of the Fathers vvas, for that they meadled in a matter nothing at all apparteinning to them. For vvhat haue religious men (that haue a distincte bodie, and a distinct common vveale, and haue distinct Superiors,) to doe vvith an other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and common vveale distinct and separt from them? VVhat had they to doe vvith the affaires, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociations and contentions of secular priestes? yea
<pb facs="46"/>vvhat had the Iesuites more to doe to meadle in it, then the Benedictines, Charterhovvse Moncks, &amp; Capuchines? of vvhich orders vve haue diuers of our natiō as desirous of, and as zealous for the good of our contrey as the English Fa. can be? Their second fault vvas, in vvritting of that vnlearned and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous booke of schisme against the Priestes that vvere innocent thereof and farr from the note of sedition and rebellion, for that vvithstanding the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priestes institution vpon a Cardinalls letters, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Hol. Bull: as in this discourse is sufficiently proued. I find not so great fault vvith the vvritter (for he might be commanded to doe it) as vvith the Superior for commanding it to be done, and vvhen it vvas done so vnadvisedly by his subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approue it. for our rule in lavve saith:</hi> ea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra facimus quibus nostra impartimur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem. <hi>VVe make those things our ovvne, to the vvhich vve doe impart our aucthoritie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>One of the ARchpriestes faultes vvas, for that vvithout iudgement and prudence he subscribed also to that booke and by his approbatiō made it as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as he could. His other faulte vvas, his ouer much seueritie tovvardes his bretherne: as vvell appeareth by his ansvveres to them laid dovvne in their appeale, and neither checked nor controuled by this Apologie. I might ioyne to this his tossing of the censures vvithout any regard or reuerence.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="46"/>
   <p>
      <hi>Novv for the faultes of this Apologie, I referre you to that vvhich follovveth. If I haue vvrōged the Authors thereof either in my vvords, or by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking the sence of theirs, I submitt me self to the iust reprehension of any learned and vnpassionat man vvhosoeuer, and promisse all due and charitable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And that I my self vvas free from all affection or passion vvhen I vvrote it, (except that some times I may vtter some sharpe vvorde, their fault being so euident and exorbitant, that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell vvould haue dipped his pene in gaule) may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily cōiectured, by that I vvas neuer, (as I haue said) of the one faction or th'other: but all vvaie kept me self free and cleare from all passion, loving and honoring both sides and parties as my deare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymē, hauing vvished and desired that some good peace and appointment might be made amongst them. Novv for more proof of my neutralitie first, I neuer vvrote or subscribed any letter in my life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the Fathers for the others, nor for the Fa. against them, nor euer vvas dealer in any actiō Pro or con, for either partie. Secondly, there haue passed throughe this tovvne men of both sides, and also haue lodged vvith me somtimes men of either faction, at one and the self same time: The vvhich vvere equally vvellcome vnto me, I gaue them all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies the like and equall countenāce, bicause I loved them egally, for that they vvere English Priests or
<pb facs="47"/>Catholikes. And for this I referre me to the report of such of either side, that haue done me that honor and pleasure as to visite me. Lastly if I could be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall or affected more to one side then an other (as in truth I cannot be) there are many reasons and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, vvhy I should leane rather to the Archpriest &amp; his side, them to th'other. for that I haue many old and deare frēds of that side, both at home and abrode: to omitt the Archpriest him self vvith vvhom I haue bene acquainted aboue theese</hi> 35. <hi>yeares, as vvell in Oxford, as in Dovvay, and since that in Ingland. My brother vvho should be the dearest to me in this vvorld (as I vndrestand) is of that side: So is M. Henry Shavve my oldest frend, one of the 6. assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāts named by the Card. M. Brāston, ād M. VViggs, vve hauing beene brought vp together &amp; fellovves of one and the same colleage. and to the last very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary bound for a singuler frendshipp he once in Dovvay shevved me. Besids M. Archer (vvhom these nicnamed the discontented bretherne seame egerly to pursue) is my deare frend and godsoon. To omitt a great nombre of my acquaintance that are amongest the vnited Priest (as they are named) the supposed Authors of this Apologie. On th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side I knovv no man vvith vvhom I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted but M. Edvvard Bennett, nor to vvhom I am bound for any benefitt or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie frendshipp receaved, but to M. Bluett, vvho
<pb facs="47"/>some</hi> 25. <hi>yeares since, did me a good turne, the vvhich if euer occasion shalbe offered, I meane to requite</hi> in eodem genere amicitiae. <hi>By these fevve you may perceive hovv free I am from faction and cleare frō all passion to either partie. You may ask me then, hovv chauuce you begine novv to entremeadle, the strife and sturre being at the vvhottest? I ansvvere. If I had neuer seene the Apologie, I should neuer haue thought vpon the matter: but seeing such fond and foolish matter therin, and by that booke percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the iustice of the cause of those called disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priests, I could not hold my hand I confesse, but for your sake and in recompence of the booke, to send you my aduice there vpon, hoping you vvill looke more deeper into the cause and cōsider of it beter and not geve such credit to the Apologie as you seeme by your letters to doe, and vvith all to see more clealy vvhere the faultes of all these scandalous and vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable troubles are to be laid, and vvho vvere the first occasioners of it, and after that, the renevvers therof. This is the end and scope of my vvritting. I haue not respected my fore said frends, nor the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers amongst vvhō I haue many a good frend</hi> quia magis mihi amica est veritas. <hi>truth and true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling betvvene Priests and Religious, ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all vvorldly respects and carnall frēds: as I haue endevored to doe in these notes of myne. And so after my humblest and hartiest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="48"/>to you and by you to all the Seniors of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance vvith you. I committ you to god and my self to your deuout</hi> Memento <hi>from Pont. a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
