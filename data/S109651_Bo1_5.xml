   <head>The preface.</head>
   <head>To my right worshipfull
suster dame Suzan
Kyngestone.</head>
   <p>THe circumspecte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone,
whiche is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
one tyme in
the yere, to bee vexed
with feuer, Catarre,
or lyke syckenes, preuenteth that
tyme by expulsing the matter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
moughte bee occasion of suche
disseases, and studiethe to reduce
the bodie into suche temperaunce,
and soo to preserue it as the saied
mattier shall not bee augmented,
wherby moughte ensue any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Like industrie, or rather mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
more, oughte to be vsed, good
Suster, of euery reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

sickenes and finall dissoluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of nature called corporal death,
as also against all worldly vexaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and troubles, called the toyes
of fortune, or the crankes of the
worlde: consideryng that of any of
theim neither the time can bee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
whan they shall happen, nor
assured remedye maie bee founden
for to repell them, onely a pure and
constaunte faithe, hauynge therto
ioyned wisedom and pacience, may
sustaine their assaultes, and strong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
resiste theim. As it is excellently
declared and taughte by the holly
doctour and martyr saincte Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
in a sermon whiche he made to
the people of Affrica, where he was
Byshoppe, in the time whan there
was continuall persecucion of pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims,
and also mortalitee by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralle
pestilence. Whiche sermone


<pb facs="169"/>
whan I had ones perused in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng,
I liked so well, that I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that all other persons mought
vnderstande it. Remembring that
many there bee (whiche I doubte
not) are as neigligent as I in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideryng
those sondrie calamitees,
not withstandynge that they haue
beholden men and women of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
astate, whiche haue died eyther
before that they loked for death, or
in some other wise than they vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
saulfe, orels for saken of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
haue liued in pouerty, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as wel for their instruction as
mine, howe we maie be alwaie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
againste those naturall and
worldly afflictions, I haue trauns<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lated
this littell boke: not super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiously
folowing the letter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is verely elegant, and therfore
the harder to traunslate in to oure

and entent of the Auctour I haue
attemted (not with litel study) to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce
into englishe the right phrase
or fourme of speaking, vsed in this
treatise, whiche I haue dedycate
and sent vnto you for a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

but also muche more for your

and to ioyne in your praiers
to god for me, that I maie be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

well suche other workes as bene in

but wonderfull fruitful, made
by the vertuous and noble prince
Iohn̄ Picus Erle of Mirandula,
who in abundaunce of learnynge
and grace incomparablie excelled
all other in his time &amp; sens. Whose
picture I wolde to god were in all
noble mens Chambers, and
his grace and vertues in
theyr soules and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Hertely fare
