vnto my selfe more certaintie of the matter related, then my great vncle <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. William Roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> could haue, euerie one might iudge me both vaine and arrogant, of whose sin ceritie none that euer knewe him or heard of him, can doubte, I being the third in descent from S.

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of Gods ayde, and this Saint's holie praiers, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to say somewhat thereof; this being one propertie of affection, to suppose, that whosoeuer hath spoken, or whatsoeuer hath benesayd of him, whome we loue, all that we thinke nothing, if we ourselues haue not sayd
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
somewhat in his praise; although (alas) we are often the vnfittest men for that purpose, we being not able to vtter what we conceaue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our passion taketh away much of our conceipt; and therefore we vtter for the most parte either broken words, or vnperfect sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, more intelligible to him, that searcheth the secretts of mens harts, then to others that heare them spoken, or reade them in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
   <p n="3">3. But one may aske me, why I should <note place="margin">And for speciall cause knovvn to my self alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> challenge more affection to this man, then anie other of my kinne, of whome few or none haue endeauoured to write any thing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; I answer, that though I haue had more cause perhaps then anie man else to loue him, and honour him, which is best knowen to my selfe, and not fitt to be related vnto all men, <hi>secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum meum mihi;</hi> yet will I not ascribe to my selfe so great a priuiledge of louing him best, I being the yongest and meanest of all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie; lett this suffice him, that is a curious sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of this my deede, that as Doctour <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

was moued to take paines in setting forth the actions of S. THOMAS MORE, because he was borne in the verie same moneth and yeare, wherein he suffered his glorious martyrdome; so was I borne anew and regenerated by the <note place="margin">As also for being borne on the day of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</note> holie Sacrament of Baptisme on the verie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me day (though manie yeares after) on which S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. THOMAS MORE entred heauen triumphant, to witt, on the sixt day of luly. And therefore haue I had some speciall confidence of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular furtherance and blessing. For how, I pray you, could I euer haue hoped to haue liued as hevre of S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. THOMAS his familie, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye <note place="margin">And by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the honour to be the heyre of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> at this time some parte of his inheritance, all which by his attaynder he had lost vtterly from himself and his children, if his praiers had not, as it were begged it at Gods hands? besides I was the yongest of thirteene children of my father, the last &amp; meanest of fiue sonnes, foure of which liued to mens estate; and yet it hath bene Gods holie pleasure, to bestowe this in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance vpon me; which though perhaps I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no cause to boaste of, because it may be a
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
punishment vnto me for my faultes, if I vse it not well, and a burden, which may weighe me downe full deepe; yet will the world coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it to be a great blessing of God, and so I ought to acknowledge it: And although I knowe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the vnsittest and vnworthiest of all the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to manage this estate, yet they either loathed the world, before the world fawned on thē, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in voluntarie contempt thereof, and dyed happie soules, in that they chose to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abiect in the sight of mē; or else they vtterly cast of all care of earthlie trash, by professing a strayte and religious life, for feare least the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous perills of worldlie wealth might gaule their soules, and the number of snares, which hang in euerie corner of this world, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappe thē to the endangering of their eternall saluation; and left me poore soule to sinke or swime, or, as I can, wade out of these dangerous whirle pooles, amongsts which we wordlings are ingulphed; the multitude of which eminent perils doe force me to cry first and chiefly to CHRIST IESVS: saying with his Apostles: <hi>Lord,
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
saue me, for I am in danger of drowning;</hi> and then also to craue the especiall assistance of Sr. THOMAS MORE his prayers, by whose interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I hope to wafte this my poore barke vnto her assured hauen of heauen, though shaken and crushed with winde and weather.</p>
   <p n="4">4. But none of vs must thinke, that his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance <note place="margin">Not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming only vpō his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</note> is all, we must putt our owne helping hands thereto:

his meritts are not our warrant, yea rather his exāples haue layde a greater loade on the bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of his posteritie, in that we are bound to imitate his actions more then anie other, or else more harme will fall vpon vs, because we haue not followed the foote stepps of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Forefather, according as <hi>Moyses</hi> comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded <note place="margin">VVhich lay à gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
should I therefore wish I had not bene his Grandchilde, because I haue incurred a greater bond, and shall runne into greater infamie, by forsaking my dutie? noe; God forbidde; yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this will I boldely affirme, not vpon vaine glorie, but vpon the confidence I haue of this singular man's blessing; if God would haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me choice, before he created me of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wether I would be the sonne of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Emperour, magnificent King, noble Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, couragious Lord, or his, whose I was, I would most willingly haue chosen to be the same I am (to Gods eternall glorie be it spoken.)</p>

      </gap> of witt, profound wisedome, happie discretion, perfect

Iustice, exceeding Temperance, sweete affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all excellencies of nature and morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, besides supernaturall and Theologicall guifts; as, Charitie in a high degree, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and his neighbour, a Fayth most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, which would not be daunted with anie threates or disgraces, that his Prince or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours could thunder out against him, nay not with death it selfe; a magnanimitie not to be ouercome either by feare of anie losses, or hope of anie dignities; religion and such deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as scarcely could be looked for in anie of a lay profession; which perfections beganne to shine in his infancie, and continued in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of his actions, and did not ende, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by his most glorious death which was an enterance into a most happie kingdome, wherein he both can and will haue compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and helpe vs in these our miseries; because he was raysed by God to be one of the first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous warriours in this our long persecution. Wherefore he may worthily be sett before our eyes, as a perfect patterne and liuelie example

to be imitated by vs: for he had more to loose, then most men in the land, being second to none but to the Chiefest, either in worldlie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, or his Prince's fauour; and yet did he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forgoe all, yea life it selfe, rather then to wrong his Conscience, in consenting to anie thing against the law of God, and lustice, as by this ensuing discourse will particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
