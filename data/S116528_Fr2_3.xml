   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O omit the 2. places of scripture, put in the begynning of your Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie, bicause the first is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nēt, for neither the Protector nor the Archp. vvas their superior before his. Hol. Bull. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as is often proued in these notes. the other may be very aptly applyed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chp. and our english Iesuites in Inglād, vvho vvere the first Authors and causers of all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se contentiōs abroade and at home, by vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and teaching that the Priests vvhich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to receiue the Archp. vpon a Card. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres vvithout scripp or scroule frō his Hol. vvere Schismatikes, seditious, rebellious, and I knovv not vvhat: as also is proued in these notes. Beside, the Archp. after the Bull vvas come and the priests had submitted themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues thereto, began the broyle againe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and proclayming them Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as before, vvhich also is sett dovvne in these notes. S. Paul vvilleth vnquiete people but especialy the Authors of vnquietnes to
<pb n="7" facs="51"/>be repressed (as you say) or to be rebuked (as I say): but the Arch. and Iesuites vvere the Authors of this vnquietnes, as is shevved at large in these notes, ergo you haue brought S. Paul against these, vvhome you pretend to defend and cleere from vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I beseech you then (my vnited brethrē) to looke better to the matter, and to pluck of the maske of affectiō that novve blindeth you, and to cōsider vvell that the renevving of the crime of schisme by the Archp. vvas the onely cause vvhy they vvrote in defence of their good name honor and fame, as is proued hereafter.</p>
   <p>But these scriptures are not so impertinēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought, as the place vvhich you alledge out of S. Augustin, vvhich is flatt against you for in this Apo. (as he saith) <hi>you knovv not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish betvveene true ād false</hi> yea you dare not once approche and come neere the truth. <hi>nor betvveene probations &amp; criminations:</hi> many criminations indeede you put dovvne, but you bring noe probation at all. <hi>betvvene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and fictions:</hi> your Apol. being vvhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compiled of <hi>fictions</hi> and fittons, of toyes and trifles, so farre is it from geuing any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, pertayning to the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion &amp; controuersie. <hi>betvveene handling the cause, and runing from the cause.</hi> neuer vvere men so liuely described by these vvords as you are for you are so farre from handling the cause
<pb n="8" facs="52"/>that all your drifte is to runne from the cause as is manifestly shevved in these notes: and I doubt not but that your readers hauing once read these notes vvill much vvonder at your audacitie for alleaging a place in the very front of your booke that maketh so euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against you: and that doth so palpably controule and descrie your Iuggling, fraude, and guile. <hi>yf you knovve it not?</hi> viz that this your Apol. dooth not distinguish betvveene true and false, that it hath many Crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and noe probatiōs at all of the matter in que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tion that it is full of fictions, and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of all instructions: that it handleth not the cause, but rūneth and roveth quite from the cause, <hi>yf</hi> (I say) <hi>you knovv it not?</hi> then <hi>Jam not sorie that I hane had this care to instruct you.</hi> and if thereby. <hi>your harts vvill not be turned to peace, yet our peace returneth to vs</hi> as it did to S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</p>
   <p>In the verie begynning of your epistle to the Pope,

         </gap>n the epistle to his Hol.</note> you tell his Hol. vvith <hi>vvhat greife of mynd and confusion of countenāce you are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to defend the ecclesiastical Hierarchte vvhich God inspired</hi> him <hi>to institute amongst vs.</hi> you may vvell say: vvith <hi>Confusion of countenance</hi> for to make so false a report to his Hol: in the verie entrie of your booke: vvhich Ecclesiastical Hierarchie I pray you doe you defend in this your Apol? you should here hane distinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed vvith, S. Augustine, <hi>betvveene true and
<pb n="9" facs="52"/>false</hi> for there vvere (you knovve) tvvo insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of this Hierarchie, one by the Card. letters, as you confesse in the 8. pag. of your epistle and in the 10. you talke of an other institution made by his Hol: breue 1599. In defence of vvhich of these 2. Institutions, I praie doo you vvrite? yf of the first, thē may you vvell in deede, haue <hi>greife of mynde and be confused in countenance,</hi> yea and cautherized in conscience for abusing his Hol: vvith so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a falshood. But tell me in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest is, <hi>This Apol. vvritten to the Catholicks of Ingland in defence of the ecclesiastical Hierarchie,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by the Cardinals letters? yf you say yea: these notes doo vtter your impudencie, and doe shevve to all Catholicks in Ingland and out of Inglād, that you neuer dare come neere the question, but that you flie from it as from a Toade: and thar you haue not as yet ansvvered one onely reason of moe then 30. that your brethren bring against it, albeit your account thē but fonde and of no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce at all. Let all Catolickes novve Iudgee if you ought not vvorthely to be <hi>cōfused in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> to make so flatt a fitton to his Hol: and that in print, in making him and all men to beleeue that you vvrite this your Apol. in de fence (forsooth of the Ecclesiastical <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, by him so fatherly and prudently instituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs:</hi> vvhen as (I say) I shovve to all such as are not starke blinde, in these my notes:
<pb n="10" facs="53"/>that you flie from and shoone that matter, as from a venemous Serpent: yf then you haue abused his Hol: touching the first institution hovve can you excuse your selues and say: that this your Apol. is vvritten in defence of the second institution, made and confirmed by his Hol: buls? A faire peece of vvorke vvho I praie you dooth or hath impugned it? you fight vvith your ovvne shadovve in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Hol. beleeue, your vvriting is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his institution of the Archpr. you should first haue prooued it to be impugned, and then to haue defended it. Nay, it is so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re from being impugned by your brethren, that you confesse frankly in this and many other places of your Apol. that so soone as they savve his <hi>Hol: Breue</hi> they by and by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and vvere recōciled to the Archp. novve the cause bothe of this first and latter breache also, vvhich vvas, for that they vvere holden and proclaimed by bookes and lettres, and confirmed by the Archp. sentence, for schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, rebellious, and factious (vvhich is the head and ground of all this controuersie) you mention not at all. and yet you are so shameles, as to tell Christes vicar, that you vvrite in defence of the Archp. for the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of vvhose institution vpon a Card. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters your brethren vvere defamed vvith the horrible cryme of schisme. VVell, if you haue in this your Apol. defended neither the
<pb n="11" facs="53"/>first nor last institution hovve are you able to defend your selues from a most haynōs fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? I charge you vvith it and that in good earnest, and in your next either discharge your selues in shevving, that you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the one or the other institution, and that by solid and substantiall prooffes, orels I vvill leaue you the vvhetstone, as vvorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gayned by you, and that in fittoning to the highest povver and Potentat vpon earth.</p>
   <p>The reader may gather by this epistle, hovve substantially you hādle the matter through out your Apolog. for the same order you keepe heere, the same kinde of prooffes you obserue and bringtherein. you haue taken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you to defend the Ecclesiasticall Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie institured by his Hol. lett vs see hovv coningly and learnedly you doo it. First, in the yeare 1558 her Maiestie began to raigne, and the Protestants gayned more in the first 10. yeares of her raigne, then in the 34. that haue eusued, ergo, the institutiō of the Arch. made, by a Card. lettres, vvas lavve full and to be obayed. In the yeare 1568. the colledge at Douay vvas erected by D. Allen. ergo, the institution of the Archp. vvas lavvfull. And heere is to be noted, you haue sett the Cart before the horse. for first you mētiō the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of Douay, ād fondatiō thereof, ād then after, hovv learned men placed them selues in diuers vniuersities, and vvrote bookes in
<pb n="12" facs="54"/>confutation of heresie. vvhereas, these men you meane, hadde vvritten their bookes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a faire yeare-before there vvas any Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie thoght or dreamed of. I vvould pray the Reader heere to marke vvell the order of this tale laid dovvne in their second note, and I vvil maruell if thou maruell not much at it.</p>

   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The counsell raised sedition amongst out selues g<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. &amp;c.

I beleeue as vvell as you
<pb n="13" facs="54"/>that they vvere spies, and I knovve that they vvere aftervvards in Ingland very naughtie fellovves, and did much hurt there: but I am ashamed that you shold either say or thinke that such base varlets coulde sovve any see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of sedition in Rome: all those that knevve those companions vvill controule you of ouersight in this point, asvvell as I doo. But be it they sovved seditiō in Rome in the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re 1578. g<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. the institution of the Archp. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by a Card. letters in the yeare 1598.

   <p>In the yeares 1582. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and 1584. there beganne an emulation in Paris of somme Gentlemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst D.

<pb n="16" facs="56"/>and proue that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Hierarhis</hi> vvas lavvfully and duly instituted by the Card.

I pitie your case, and am in deede full sorie, to see hovve you hane plucked an old hovvse vpon your hed. <hi>ƲVith this Subordination all good and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Catholickes vvere contented and cōforced</hi> (you saie) g<seg rend="sup">o</seg> it vvas lavvfully instituted. but vvhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you saie, <hi>it came from the see Apostolicke;</hi> by your leave you fitten. for nothing is said to comme <hi>from the see Apostolick,</hi> except it come vnder the <hi>Breues</hi> or Buls of that see, as in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se notes shalbe prooued. but heere vvas no Bull from that See, g<seg rend="sup">o</seg> you say not vvell, that it came from the See Apostolike, seing it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me but from a Card. Protector vvho had no authoritie to doe it, nor any iurisdiction or povver at all in Ingland. you add: <hi>that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question the Card. letters,</hi> and that vvhich follovveth, so they did in deede and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly, and still doe, for any thing you haue, or can say to the contrarie, or in defence of the Card. or his letters.</p>
   <p>In all this your Apol. (vvhich you make his Hol. beleeue is vvritten in defence of the Card. institutiō of the Archp.) you haue not
<pb n="17" facs="56"/>one vvord or reason. I say, not one, for the defence of the Card. and his dooings: you say: <hi>they impugned his Hol. meaning.</hi> hovv I praie you could they doe that, hauing nether that breue, bul, nor letter frō his Hol. explicating or declaring to them his meaning? it is but your imagination. hovve (I praie you) can I tell vvhat your meaning is, except you expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat the same to me, ether by vvord of mouth letter, or expresse messēger. But his Hol. by none of these meanes shevved or declared his meaning vnto them. g<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. they could not impugne it.</p>
   <p>But that vvhich follovveth is a meere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie: <hi>yea they called into quostion your authoritie it selfe, vvhither you could doo it vvithout them or no.</hi> this to be a nanghtie slander and a fovvle calumnie is often proued in these notes, to the places I referre you.</p>
   <p>At last vvee are come to the Popes breue in cōfirmatiō of the said <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> to the vvhich you confesse your brethren did obey, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sought <hi>occasions to breake againe.</hi> vvhat vvere these occasiōs? for shooth, as you calumniat: thē <hi>they vvere so engaged to the councell that they could not hold long.</hi> The counsell serueth you vvell for a maske, to couer the cause of this last breach: vvhich yet they lay dovvne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervvise both simplie and plainly, and lay it vpon the Archp. and Iesuits backe, and that so firmely, that in all your Apol. you cannot
<pb n="18" facs="57"/>as yet clavve it of, neither in deede doe you goe about it, the matter is so plaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Hovve iustlie they appealed, is shevved hereafter. I knovve not vvhat you meane in this your epistle by <hi>Scandalous and temerarious propositions:</hi> But sure I am, that you your selues haue accused and accompted the cheifest points of our Cath. religion, for <hi>scandalous, dangerous, and offensiue doctrine,</hi> to your eternall shame, as in these notes vvill appeere.</p>

Mary, hovve vvel manured and ripened vvas the Inglish Cath. harnest 22. yeares ago, vvhen the <hi>Iesuits</hi> vvear sent first in? I ansvveare: So vvell as it hath beene at any time since, for the space of time, and the nomber of the vvorkemen. you say, noe and I say, yes. you talke of 22. yeares manuring by the trauell of 400. Priests and Iesuits to helpe them. and I talke of 5. yeres space onely, and of 100. and odd vvorkemen, If the Priests in that tyme had not manured it vvel and brought it to somme repenes, vvhere had the Iesuits found harbor or hovvses to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, or men to mainteine them in that order they vveare mainteined? it vvas the secular Priests that brought them into honor and credit, and this thanke they haue for it. vvho is so blinde, that dooth not see by this place, that the Author of this Apol. is a Iesuit, attributing to him self and his, the manuring and ripenes of our English har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest: and that 2. Iesuits (although othervvise learned &amp; vertuous men) could doo more good to the ripening of the haruest, then a 100. seminarie Priests: this in deede is both falshood and vanitie. But let vs examine your
<pb n="27" facs="61"/>brethrens vvords, and see vvhat falshood and vanitie they haue committed. Theysaie, that the <hi>seminarie Priests did svveat in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest of England before the Iesuits came</hi> in. yf the falshood be in that there vvere seminarye Priests in England before the fathers vvent in? I can assure you there vvere somme for v, yeares space before the fathers entred. and that there vvere at the least a hundreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vvent in. <hi>M. Barlovve</hi> beinge the first seminatye Priest that entred, can testifie so much. So can the R. Archp. and diuers of his assistantz vvhoe had beene in Ingl: somme yeares before the fathers. Is the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or vanitie in that they say: <hi>they svvet in the haruest?</hi> yf the suffering imprisonement and close imprisonement and martyrdoome (as somme of them had done before the coming of the Iesuits) losse of goods and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, may not be termed svveating? then I confesse they haue committed falshood and vanitie for saying so. But lyeth the falshood and vanitie in that they say: <hi>there vvas a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest then in Ingland?</hi> O vanitie of vanitie! o blindnes! o shameles vvriter! are these fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods? are these vanities? are they not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie solid Truth it selfe? vvhat poore Priests are you to vvrite against your ovvne knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and against your ovvne consciences, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth? vae vobis that say: darkenes is light and light darkenes. But peraduenture there
<pb n="28" facs="62"/>is falshood and vanitie in the vvordes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vving: <hi>vvhich haruest vvas then vvell manured &amp; almost ripe, somme Iesuits vveare called in by D.

Is the falshood in <hi>Almostripe?</hi> yea forsooth. and vvhy so? bicause nothing can be ripened, but hy the Iesuits. vvhere they comme, all is ripe incontynent. Is it a falshood or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to saie, that <hi>somme Iesuits vvere called in to helpe them by D.

   <p>I must yet aduertize thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) of an egregious vntruth before I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an end that is: vvhere this Author saith in the end of his table, that he vvill not cite any thing out of the English booke, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath examined the same sufficiently in the</hi> 1.2.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.

   <p>But you say: <hi>it may be somme other vvill examine more exactly these bookes.</hi> indeede so he hath neede, for you hane examined
<pb n="39" facs="67"/>them as lightlie and as slenderly as any man vvell could doo. Yf fearefull fleeing from the Truth, ansvvearing to no one Reason, and filling your Readers eares vvith tittle tattle, be an exact examination. and as you conclude, this vvill in deede be sufficient for him that vvill not take the peaynes to Reade your Apol. but to beleeue you or your vvord. but to him that vvill reade it vvith care and diligence and seeke on vvhich fide the Truth lieth, the same vvill prooue verie insufficient and not vvoorthie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of an Apologie, vvhich is a defence of truth: and so shall see to your <hi>Confusion of countenance</hi> hovve poorely, faintly, and vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akly you defend your <hi>Eccliastical Hierarchis</hi> sett vp and iustituted by a Card.

And for an end of this table, I must aduertise thee (Reader) that the Priests haue printed another booke in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin dedicated to the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> in vvhich they hane simplie and plaiuly sett dovvne the controuersie, and haue not roved therein at bymatters, nor touched the name or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of any parson in perticular or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: to the vvhich booke, these men are so farre from ansvvearing, as they doo not once name it, or make mention of it, in this their breif Apol. I knovve not vvhat they vvil doo in their more larger and ample vvhich they promise thee. and if the Priests
<pb n="40" facs="68"/>had kept them selues vvith in the compasse of their matter, in this booke sent to his Hol. vvee had lost this vvoorthy peece of vvoorke, the vvhich is vvritten in the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of somme perticular men, and of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and not in defence of the Hierarchie, as they vntruly vvould make his Hol. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. for, as I haue often sayd, and must oftentymes hereafter note, the Author ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commeth neere the matter or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. vvhich I must aduertize (the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to note and mark diligently.</p>

   <p>you add: <hi>no certaine author, &amp;c.</hi> of this point I haue talked in these notes, little to your credit.</p>
   <p>I hope and presume vvith you <hi>that euerie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet reader vvill of himself novve ponder both your points,</hi> and the others that I haue laid dovvne, and thereby iudge, hovve vvell you defend the matter in controuersie in this your Apol.

   <p>your Conclusion then is, that this brief Apol.

   <p>you vaunt, that you haue vvritten this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. <hi>in a far other style then the Authors of these bookes haue:</hi> lett the Reader iudge.

<pb n="49" facs="72"/>are (if not defamed) yet taunted, as bitterly by name, as thothers are in whose defence they write.</p>
   <p>But you promisse a larger Apol. which shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be more <hi>substantiall and authentick.</hi> wherefore? bicause you will haue informations and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not onely out of our contrey, but also from <hi>forraine realmes.</hi> as who should say, that priuat mens letters, especially of the assistāts and of such as are creatures or fautors of the Iesuits, are to be accompted, of any graue or wise man, either substantiall or authentick, mary, if you bring vs the signes and publick seales of Princes, or citties, then I will hold with you, and call them anthentick, other wise to thinke your Reader will take priuat letters for substantiall and authentick matter is to thinke him to be a verie fole and an asse.</p>
   <p>Well, you will get <hi>informations, letters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvritings concerning this affaire.</hi> which affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I praie you? to defend the institution and subordination of the Archp. made by the Card. letters? there is no neede of other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge to proue that, but by the canons, the interpretors, and the Glosse. other writinges are of no forse in this point. or is it to prooue your <hi>most entierly belooued Brethren</hi> to haue bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Schismaticks, for not receyuing him? I am suer you can doe no more, nor say more in that point, then fa. Lister hath done, or is it to prooue that the Archp. receiued a letter
<pb n="50" facs="73"/>from the mother cittie by which he was adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to hold them for Schismaticks after they hadd obayed the Popes bull, for with stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Card. letters? this matter your belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued brethren haue committed to the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to iudge and resolue, to whome and not to any priuat letters, the decision appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Or to be short, will you bring <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call informacion</hi> to proue that the Protector of Ingland hath power or iurisdiction, vpon Inglishmen, in Ingland or out of Inglād? this in deede were a worke worthie such wnited hedds. But in truth, this affaire, is the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the name and credit of somme that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue beene vncharitably bitten by your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne and nothing els. you haue wearyed vs alredie, with your Romaine sturres, Paris ād Flanders factions, Giffords and Gratlies boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, fa. Westons praises, Wisbiches troubles, fishers memorial and examinatiōs, Watsons common welthe, and with a great bundle of tedions letters. for the loue of God no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. But if you will be doing, touch the points in controuersie, twang vpō that string: shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te at the marke, and riun not a rouing, as you haue doon in this: otherwise you will loose, both your paines, costes, and creditt: and of this I warne you as a frend, and as one that wisheth your honor, and your quietnes. for if you sett <hi>dovvne things at length,</hi> in your next in that order, and after that fashion you haue
<pb n="51" facs="73"/>doon heere: certaynly, both those that liue presently, and the posteritie after vs, will wonder to see howe God hath blinded you, and left you to your fantasies, and made you to pronounce your selues, to be the cheife disturbers in this cause, to impugne the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and constitutions of the Church, and not to decide, but to run quite from the Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie nowe in hand. Besides I pronostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vnto you, that if in your next you giue not better <hi>stayes and stoppes then in this: the diuers good mē vvho vrged you to vvrite and at vvhose requeste,</hi> you haue published this booke, if they haue so much witt as goodnes in thē: will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be sorie to haue requested you to write so foolishlie: but also, will quitt you, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce you to haue more care to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>intemperat manner of proceedinge,</hi> of your brethren, then to defend the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Hierarchie, instituted by the Card. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as in your Epistle you promised his Hol. well, when these informations come from so farre contreyes, I doubt not, but they wilbe veiwed and sifted, as wel as these are, that came not so farre. and then the Readers will weigh and consider, which side writeth, <hi>ƲVithout all regard of truth and modestie,</hi> and on which side the truth lieth and leanethe.</p>
   <p>In the meane tyme, till your other be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to succeede I shall desire the reader to pervse this diligently, and to conferre these
<pb n="52" facs="74"/>my notes there with: whereby they shall see, howe you are bound to doe that, you wish your brethren heere to doe, that is, christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to correct your selues, confesse and satisfie for the faults, you haue committed, in slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and calumniating them, for such faultes (I say) as your owne consciences shall accuse you of, and then to amend &amp; correct all the faulte I note herein against you. For if it pleased God to giue you this spirit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, this controuersie would quickly be at an end, ād all should be in order and quiet againe. And as you wish your brethrē to doe in respect of them, whome they haue iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or infamed, so doe I wish and exhort them to it, as they are bound in conscience to doe. and you to doe the like againe on your part: you (I say) my vnited brethren, or whosoeuer (be he Religious or priest) that is Author of this Apologie. for your so doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Angels in heauen will reioyce, all mē will be thereof full gladd, the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my shalbe confounded, the haruest at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, wilbe better cultiued, Gods glorie wilbe augmented, loue and amitie betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren wilbe encreased, infinit Soules wilbe gayned, your old glorie and renowne recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and all strifes, troubles, and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies remooued, and forgotten, yea and many a one of you with martyrdoome for this hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes crowned, but if you go on as you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="53" facs="74"/>begune, and as you seeme to continue, the contrarie of all this will happen, to your dishonor and discredit in this world, and to your shame at the dredfull day of iugement. God of his infinit goodnes mollifie your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie harte, open your eyes, make you yeeld to the truthe, and in the end bring you, your brethren, your Readers, and my self to his eternall blisse. Amen.</p>
