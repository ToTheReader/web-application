   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Vgustine</hi> (Right Reuerend Father)
when a certaine young man of no
good fame,<note place="margin">Epist. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> had accused one <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius,</hi>
a Minister or Presbyter, of a
great crime (they both beeing of
his owne Colledge and societie)
though he gaue more credit vnto
the Presbyter,<note place="margin">Quamvis magis Presbytero <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didissem.</note> yet the matter han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in suspense and doubt, he sent them both for the
more full manifestation of the truth, vnto the tombe of
<hi>Felix</hi> the Martyr: for they had a great opinion of such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in those daies. My case at this time in some things is
not much vnlike: who hauing beene a Minister and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
of this Church, and a poore Preacher and writer of
the same now these twentie yeares, am at the last, by one
of obscure fame and name,<note place="margin">See Imput. 1. recrimin.</note> accused before your <hi>Grace,</hi> of
heresie, blasphemie, and charged with the deniall of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the faith. In which accusation, as I doubt not, but
that your <hi>Gr.</hi> opinion is as indifferent toward me (whose
Parents, education, studies, and trauailes, you haue knowne
these many yeares) as <hi>Augustines</hi> was toward <hi>Bonifacius;</hi>
yet herein my case is better, that I doe referre my selfe to
the iudgement of a Reuerend Prelate liuing, and am not
sent to the triall of the dead.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Archidamus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plutarch. inter Laconica apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmata.</note> not much vnlike to the former exampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
beeing chosen an arbitrator betweene two that were at
variance, brought them into the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi>
and hauing first bound them with an oath to stand to his
sentence, decreed, <hi>that they should not depart thence, before
they had compounded the controuersie. Crates Thebanus</hi>
is said to haue vsed to resort vnto fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">

So your (Honour) not so much by choice an arbitrator, as
by office and place a Iudge in these causes, will bring vs
both (I trust) into the Temple of GOD, there to be tried
by the Scriptures: And as <hi>Crates</hi> endeauour was to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
families, so I hope, your <hi>Gr.</hi> care is, to settle this Church
in peace: approouing that godly saying of <hi>Basilius;</hi>

      </gap>, <hi>that
nothing is so proper to a</hi> (Bishop) <hi>as to be a peacemaker.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Mine aduersarie hath had the prioritie of complaint,
and first filled your eares (though not possessed them) with
his vntrue surmises: for I doubt not, but as <hi>Alexander,</hi>
when one of his familiar friends was traduced before him,
stopped one of his eares,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> as <hi>reseruing it for him that was
absent:</hi> so your <hi>Gr.</hi> hath one eare left for me: according
to that rule of <hi>Seneca, Vtrique parti actiones dares,
dares tempus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de ira.</note>
      <hi>non semel audires: magis enim veritas elucet,
quo saepius ad manum venit:</hi> to giue vnto both parties
their action, and to graunt them time, to heare more then
once: for the oftner the truth cometh to hand (to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
the more the light thereof appeareth. <hi>Cicero</hi> against
<hi>Antonie</hi> said:<note place="margin">Cicer. Philip. 2.</note>
      <hi>quid mihi plenius, quid vberius, quam mihi, &amp;
pro me, &amp; contra Antonium, dicere:</hi> But I may adde the
third; that it contenteth me, that I may speake not onely
for my selfe, and against such an one, but before your <hi>Gr.</hi>
As for his accusations, I feare them not, mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
testifying with me: I will (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith) <hi>take them
vpon my shoulder,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob 31. 36.</note>
      <hi>and bind them as a crowne vnto me.</hi> For,
as <hi>Cyprian</hi> well saith,<note place="margin">de baptism. Christ.</note> but vpon an other occasion; <hi>nequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quā
sub hoc onere lassitudinem, sed quietem inventuri:</hi> vnder

this burthen I shall not finde wearines, but rest. As <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
also saith:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. contra Petil. c. 7.</note>
      <hi>qui volens detrahit famae meae, nolens addit
mercedi:</hi> he that willingly detracteth from my fame,
doth against his will adde to my reward.</p>
   <p>But two things I doe not a little, wonder at, that he
durst abuse your <hi>Gr.</hi> eares, with such vntrue and vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
invectures in his Epistle, and the Reader, with such
grosse and absurd ouersights in his booke.</p>
   <p>In the first,<note place="margin">Epist. Dedicat.</note> he chargeth me with a <hi>prophane and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

Thus much concerning my selfe I say in generall in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi>

Know this to be alwaies the worke of the deuill,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. epist. 2.</note> to vexe
the seruants of God with lies, that they which are cleare
in the light of their conscience, should be blemished with
other mens reports. Now, though he tooke vnto himselfe
this libertie, in this vnfriendly manner to disgrace me, yet
he might haue shewed more modestie, then to outface
me with such vntruths, in your <hi>Gr.</hi> presence. It is said, that
the actors of those wanton playes, called <hi>Floralia: Catone
<pb facs="4"/>
praesente agere recusarūt: refused to play in Catoes presence:</hi>
and he might haue forborne to haue vttered his forged ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations
before so graue a personage. But I trust it will
fall out here, as sometime in the like case with <hi>Augustine:
Experti dicimus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tom. 10. ser. 49.</note>
      <hi>nam non crederemus, multi à nobis mala
consilia petunt, consilia mentiendi, consilia circumveniendi,
sed in nomine Christi nullus talis nos tentavit:</hi> I speak (saith
he) by experience, otherwise I would not haue beleeued,
many doe aske of vs euill counsell, counsell to lie, counsell
to circumvent; but in the name of Christ, none such hath
tempted vs. Neither (I hope) hereafter, your wisdome will
giue passage or licence to such mens intemperate pennes,
to wound and gall their brethren: yet had hee staied here
onely, in censuring the liuing, and not proceeded to taxe
the memorie of the dead, it had been more tolerable: that
godly learned man Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who is now at rest in
the Lord, is thus iniuriously handled by him, and that since
his Christian departure; <hi>whereby grace may so happily
worke in their hearts,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. dedi. p. 11.</note>
      <hi>that where the truth hath beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

were either voide of grace, or did frowardly exclude the
truth: nay he spareth not to charge him, <hi>as guiltie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,</hi>
      <note place="margin">See Impu. 1. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crim.</note>
      <hi>irreligious, hereticall, sacrilegious opinions, of grosnes,
sophistrie, profanenesse, &amp;c.</hi> It is said of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that
in his returne from battell, seeing a dead body lying with
iewels of gold, hee thus spake to one that was with him,
<hi>Take thou away these things,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plutarch. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. de regend. republic.</note>
      <hi>for thou art not Themistocles:</hi>
neither would this man, if he had beene, (I say not of an
heroicall spirit, as <hi>Themistocles</hi>) but of a sober and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
spirit, as euery good Christian, haue stripped the
dead of his well deserued ornaments: in seeking to impaire
his credit, he doth but blemish and obscure his owne; and
sheweth himselfe to bee of those, who as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,
<hi>Hippocratis fomentis magis, quam monitis nostris indigent:</hi>
had need rather of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> medicine, then our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
   <p>Now may it please your (Reuerend Fatherhood) to
<pb facs="4"/>
giue me leaue, to offer vnto your view some of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
contents of his booke: by the tast whereof, it will
appeare, what relish the rest haue; &amp; by the smell of some
of his flowers,<note place="margin">Dixit se foetor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>Hilarion</hi> said to <hi>Hesychius,</hi> when a bunch of small
pulse was brought them out of a Churles garden, <hi>that hee
could not abide the stinch thereof: Doe you not feele (saith
he) a filthy sauour, and euen his couetousnesse to smell in the
pulse?</hi> So by this handfull, which I shall gather out of his
booke, the euill sauour will be found of the rest.</p>
   <p>1. Hee much forgetting himselfe, thus breaketh out
beyond the limits of modestie,<note place="margin">1. Impu. recrim.</note> charging me with <hi>folly, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,

honester in life.</p>
   <p>2. <hi>I haue obserued 22. slaunderous imputations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some are these:</hi> that I would transforme the order of the

diuers things contrary to the truth of the Gospell:<note n="d" place="margin">Slaund. 17.</note> that he
iustifieth pestilent &amp; blasphemous heretiks, against the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and holy Fathers:<note n="e" place="margin">Slaund. 18.</note> that he holdeth the flames of hell to

faith▪ cursed rootes: <hi>with such like.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>3. <hi>Instance is giuen of 34. vntruthes vttered by him:</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">3. Imp. vntr. 6.</note> As that he beleeueth, I was one of those, which writ the
Letter to Master <hi>Hooker; the writers whereof, I knowe
not to this day:</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">9. vntr.</note> that I borrowe diuers things from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lils
booke; <hi>which I neuer sawe:</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">vnt. 11.</note> that I fasten all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of hell, vpon the blessed soule of Christ; <hi>which I neuer
thought:</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">truth denied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> that there is not one word through his booke,
that insinuateth any suspition of Limbus patrum: <hi>whereas,
in the preface following, the contrary is prooued directly,
<pb facs="5"/>
in 20. seuerall places out of his booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>4. Among the errors which he is charged with, to the
number of 14. these specially are noted:<note n="a" place="margin">Imp. 6. recr. 2.</note> he iustifieth the
Latine text, against the originall Greeke in the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:
<note n="b" place="margin">error. 2.</note> hee calleth the booke of Ecclesiasticus the
word of God, which the Church of England holdeth for
one of the Apocryphall bookes: <hi>artic.</hi> 6.<note n="c" place="margin">error 11.</note> that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of infants is not to be found in Scripture, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
mention; whereas the Church of England holdeth
it to be most agreeable to the institution of Christ: <hi>artic.</hi>
27. He calleth these sound positions,<note n="d" place="margin">imp. 2. scla. 15.</note>
      <hi>that the Scriptures
alone are not compleate vnto saluation: that mans will is
naturally apt without grace, to beleeue: that mens naturall
workes are acceptable to God:</hi> which are directly opposite
to the doctrine of the Church of England, which holdeth
the contrary: <hi>that the holy Scripture containeth all things
necessary to saluation: artic. 6. that man of his owne natural
strength cannot turne and prepare himselfe to faith: artic.
10. that workes done before the grace of Christ, are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to God: artic.</hi> 13.</p>
   <p>5. <hi>Diuers harsh and vnsauorie speeches are laid vnto
his charge; as that hee applyeth those words of Christ to
himselfe,</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">imp. 7. recr. 1.</note> de bono opere lapidor: I am stoned for a good
worke:<note n="b" place="margin">ibid. recrim. 3.</note> that Christs conquest vpon the crosse was openly
an ouerthrow, and therefore no triumph: if it were, it was a
triumph before victory:<note n="c" place="margin">recrim. 6.</note> that there is a most plaine distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betweene the holy Ghost and Christ, not in person one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but in his diuine nature. <hi>These and the like assertions,
(which he would haue tearmed blasphemies) to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of tenne, are obserued out of his booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>6. Diuers points of arrogancy, and vaine ostentation
are obserued, to the number of 13. whereof this is one,
that hee maketh his boast, that my Lord of Winchester
hath in his last booke much altered his iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the place of Peter,<note place="margin">Imp. 8. recr. 10.</note>
      <hi>mooued by the reasons laid downe
by me</hi> (saith he) <hi>and none but me:</hi> wheras it is not true, that
that Reuerend learned father, hath therein altered his

who hath (vnbidden) thrust his shoulders vnder a burthen,

   <p>Now let me craue a little further leaue to adde some
what concerning the former booke, which is by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned,
and this written in defense thereof. The first, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
(<hi>Limbomastix</hi>) I acknowledge to be mine; and am
not ashamed of any matter therein handled, though for
the manner it might haue beene more exact, I confesse.
And for the publishing thereof, this is my excuse, or rather
defense: first, that I was thereunto prouoked in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
againe, I saw in his pamphlet maintained that Popish
opinion of <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> which suspition the author
can not auoide, as it is at large declared in the Preface fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
who if he be sound in other points of Protestants
doctrine, it is well: but then is he much wronged both in
<pb facs="6"/>
the opinion, and reports of them that know him: further,
that booke passed vnder the censure of a graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writer of our Church:<note place="margin">D Sutcliff.</note> and yet it was printed without
my priuitie.</p>
   <p>As touching mine opinion of CHRISTS Descension,
handled in that booke, I will freely deliuer what I thinke:
first, I beleeue the Article of the Descension, to be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
part of our faith:<note place="margin">Lib Instit. 2. c. 16. sect. 8.</note> and say with <hi>Calvine, In the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Christ to hell, there is no small force to the effect of
our Redemption, &amp;c. and it auaileth so much vnto the
(cheife) summe of our redemption, that it beeing pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
much will be lost of the fruit of Christs death:</hi> thus
much for the substance of the Article. Secondly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the manner of Christs descension, I doe hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
whatsoeuer can be prooued out of Scripture, and
truly collected from thence. Thirdly, yet I affirme, that
out of those three places, Act. 2. 27. 1. Pet. 3. 19. Eph. 4. 9.
the locall descension of Christs soule to hell, can not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be concluded. And herein I affirme no more, then
other graue and learned writers of our Church haue done
before me.<note place="margin">Confut. of the Rhem. annot.</note>
      <hi>D. Fulke</hi> saith, that the article of Christs des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
is not grounded vpon the first text:<note place="margin">2. Act. 3.</note>
      <hi>Bish. Bilson</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth
the second place:<note place="margin">B. Bils. Survey. 676.</note> and <hi>D. Fulke</hi> out of <hi>Theodoret</hi>
sheweth,<note place="margin">Confut. Rhem. ann. Eph. 4. 1.</note> that the third maketh not for the passing of
<hi>Christ from place to place,</hi> and so consequently belongeth
not to his locall descension. Fourthly, I say notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and professe in the same words, which I set downe
before: <hi>They which hold not the locall descent of Christs
soule to hell,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Limbom. p. 5.</note>
      <hi>should not condemne the other, as Popish and
superstitious men, that are so perswaded: They which affirme
it, ought not to account them as enemies, or aduersaries to
the truth, that dissent from them therein.</hi> He that thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
is farre from <hi>either hauing his head plotting, or his
hands practising Babylonicall warres:</hi> as I am slaundered,
as I haue shewed before. Fiftly, I hold the Article of
Christs descension, as the Church of England propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it:<note place="margin">Articl. 3.</note>
      <hi>As Christ died for vs, and was buried: so also it is
<pb facs="7"/>
to be beleeued that he went downe to hell:</hi> in which words
the Article of the descension is commended in generall to
be held, without any the determination of the sense: as<note n="a" place="margin">M. Rogers in his booke of the Catholike doctrine of the Church of England, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Cambr. ann. 607.</note> he
that lately hath learnedly<note n="b" place="margin">I would he had written as soundly in some points, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the doctrine of the Sabbaoth. p. 163. 195. 192. and in other places.</note> written (dedicating his booke
to your <hi>Gr.</hi>) vpon the Articles of Religion, by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
hauing deliuered diuers senses of this Article, and
especially these three: 1. <hi>some hold that Christ descended
as God onely not as man, &amp;c. powerfully and effectually, not
personally: 2. some as man onely, either in bodie onely, &amp;c.
to the graue, or in soule onely, when he went to the place of
the reprobate, &amp;c. 3. as God and man in one person, &amp;c.
that he went, as it were into hell, when vpon the crosse, and els
where, he suffered the torments, &amp;c.</hi> Then he inferreth thus:
<hi>But till we know the natiue and vndoubted sense of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and mysterie of religion, persist we aduersaries to them
which say, that Christ descended not into hell at all, &amp;c.</hi>

   </p>
   <p>Now in this other booke, I haue framed a briefe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
vnto his calumnious accusations, not medling at all
with the argument and matter it selfe, both because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
by him vnanswered, and for that I will not crosse
the iudgement of some Reuerend learned men of our
Church, but content my selfe with that, which I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
written thereof: I haue onely answered his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
slaunders, and returned them with aduantage
vpon his owne head. I haue obserued of raylings, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
vntruths, contradictions, falsification of Fathers, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

They haue brought mee to this, that if I hold my peace, I
