      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had taken a view (right honorable and vertuous Lady) of the great and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous enormities, that issue from the filthy fountaine of pestilent flattery, the practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners wherof (as it is sayde) are the moste pernitious of al tame Beastes, I was iustly moued, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vrged in conscience, to display the wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent exercises of the flattering floake in these dayes: Not that I thinke my selfe the meetest man to take this charge in hand (beeing very rude both in phrase &amp; also inuention) but rather to call the fine sorte of writers that now swarm in England, to leaue the currant hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Venus Pageants (wherin they shew their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency) and prosecute this, so necessary matter to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied at, as a pestilent weede in a pleasant Garden, most necessary to bee Irradicate.</p>
   <p>I shall not neede to flye to the Poet Homer for his ayde in discription of the Syrens, seeinge that thus our vnhappy age is furnished with Mermaydes, whose lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring songes yeeld such daynty and delicate tunes to the eares of ambitious &amp; vaine glorious people, that while they seeme to swim in the flood of Fortune, they sinke in the stinking puddle of folly: but the wiser sorte fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of Vlisses for the auoydinge of their sweete venemous enchauntmentes. And as it is well knowen that your L. haue stopte your eares against their magicall incantations, as a patterne of prudence
<pb facs="4"/>
and discretion, for others, (both therin and in all other commendable vertues) to imitate: So I am bold, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to desire your honour to bee my Patronesse in this my inuectiue against that liberal science, which though I haue (by a contrarye) termed it the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ghth liberall Science,</hi> not that it contayneth in it any liberalitye of vertue or honest knowledge, yet because benefites are so liberally contributed vnto it (as dayly experience sheweth.) And if any Scycophant wil captiously turne vpon mee, the pyke of this edge toole, for any thing in this Epistle vnto your L contayned, I doubt not but easely to auoyde his assault, with a great multitude of witnesses. For the abandoning of which filthy Arte, I refrayne to write that which common knowledge and publike report do of your L. worthinesse dayly testify. And although I may seeme very presumtuous, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to so noble a Patronesse, with so slender a present to so learned a Lady, with so rude a Treatise, yet the great curtesie that I haue both seene &amp; receiued at your L. handes, hath enforced mee to expresse my du etifull gratuity, with this my very simple &amp; vnpolished peece of worke, in the acceptation wherof, I shalbe moste bounden vnto your honour, with my humble &amp; harty prayer vnto almighty God, both for you and my good Lorde, whom God preserue to the inestimable comfort of the common wealth of this Realme.</p>
