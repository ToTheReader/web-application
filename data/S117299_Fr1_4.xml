   <p>
      <hi>B. Aloysius Gonzaga</hi> your elder Brother, euen from his very first Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, gaue himselfe with so great ardour to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion and Piety, that about the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of his age, out of a desire to enter into the Society of <hi>IESVS,</hi> he yielded vp vnto Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Rodulph,</hi> who was in like manner his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all his ancient Dominion, and Fortunes. Where in a short time he attained to so singular a glory of excellent Vertue, and so great a name of Sanctity, as afterward Almighty God declared, by those miracles that were performed by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession after his death. Therfore by the consent of all, he is to be accounted amongst those, whose liues as a common, and holsome document for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men, are committed to writing: vpon which consideration, this taske was imposed vpon me by my Superiours, to compose this booke of his life &amp; conuersation.

   <p>For although I make no doubt, but that it will much auaile to the increasing of zeale in men, and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore I offer and present it vnto you, vnto whome of right I ought, not only in respect of your propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie with him in bloud, wherin you are nearest allied, and the loue wherwith he did alwayes most singularly affect you; but also (which truly I make most account of) for that as in this degree of life in which you remaine, you may seeme to imitate the innocency and vertue of his mind: so far, as the Bishop of <hi>Brescia</hi> doubted not vpon a time to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that there was no cause why he should be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

   <p>Therfore <hi>(Most Excellent Prince)</hi> accept this small gift, but such as according to my singular affection towards you, is giuen with a very wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
