Howbeit, forasmuch as it came vnto my hands with his earnest request to reserue it to my selfe, I had almost consented thereunto; had not the desire I haue to reconcile the contrartetie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that be held of that action, &amp; to make it known what honour the cause hath laid vpon our whole Nation, mooued me to publish the same: whereof sith there may growe a greater benefit in publique, (for that manie shall partake thereof) than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can be to him in smothering the labors he hath
<pb facs="3"/>
bestowed in setting downe the Discourse, I doubt not but he esteeming a cōmon good before his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate fancie, will pardon me herein. In the behalfe of whom, I beseech you to whose viewe and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same is offered, not so curiouslie to looke vpon the forme, as vpon the matter; which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto you as he sent it, naked and vnpolished. And you that were companions with him of the Iourney, if anie of you may thinke your selues not fully satisfied in the report of your deseruings, let me intreate you to excuse him, in that he indeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to write thereof briefly for my particular vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, did onely take notice of them who cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the seruices in chiefe, as being of greatest marke, and lay the blame vpon me, who can by no meanes auoyd it: sauing that from the fault I haue committed, (if it be a fault) I hope there may some good proceed. It hath satisfied me in many things, whereof I beeing ignorant, was led into an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceipt of the matter and of the persons: and I hope it shall both confirme others who maie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine doubtfull of either; and reforme them that hauing been seduced, are become sectaries agaynst the same. I will therefore commend the man and matter to your friendly censure, forbearing to noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his name, least I might increase mine offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; &amp; be namelesse my selfe for other good considerations: which I leaue friendly Reader to thy best construction.</p>
