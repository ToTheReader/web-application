   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, and hath been long time a question more enquired into vpon occasion, thē soundly weyed for the good of Gods Church, whether there be any moe waies of right handling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then one? and if there bee, which is the best thereof? The solution whereunto (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the infinite varietie of preaching among vs Englishmen more then in all the Churches of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides) hath been, that there are indeed diuers manners of preaching, which may all be profitably vsed for the edification of the bodie of Christ. But if the practise of many be well weyed, it will easily appeare (supposing that there be diuers) that we haue been very carelesse to enquire after the best and to vse it. For, whilest some giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vpon the least occasion, to enter into a common place of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and to handle it most largely (which is the right way in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising and laying the foundations of Religion) and others labour to shewe themselues learned in the tongues, and humaine Artes, or of great reading in diuine and heathen writers, we see that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is brought either into such amazednesse, as they thinke that any thing may be made of the Scriptures, or to such an vnsetlednesse in iudgement, as they rather hunt after varietie of teachers for their straunge manner of preaching, then for sound instruction for their owne edification. How this sore may bee cured, I will not take vpon me precisely to say, for it is easier rightly to espie a fault, then to shew the way to amend it, and it may be that there is not one, but diuers causes of this enormitie, some whereof are growne to such vlcers, as may not without danger be touched. Onely I will be bold to say some thing to the questiō propoūded before, not so much striuing whether there be diuers kinds of teaching, as labouring to shew such away as
<pb facs="3"/>
must needes be the best and most profitable. First therefore we are to know that the end wherefore Christ Iesus when he ascended into heauen, and leading captiuitie captiue gaue guifts vnto men, was for the edification of the bodie of Christ, <hi>Eph. 4. 12.</hi> that is, to build vp Gods people in the true knowledge of his holy word, and so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in the faith, and reforme them in their liues. Now to the end that this may be done, I suppose euery one will confesse first, that the workman whom God hath fitted to this great worke, must be that scribe taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, which is like vnto the housholder that bringeth out of his treasurie things both old and new, <hi>Matth 13. 52.</hi> that is, furnished with al kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge meet to expresse Gods will to his people in most effectuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Then it cannot be denied that, seeing it is onely the word of God that can perswade the conscience, the first thing that is to be done in the right teaching of the same to Gods people, must needes be, the cleere and euident deliuerance of the sense of the text in hand; that out of the same, as from a fountaine that runneth cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all that he is further to deliuer may be seene to be deriued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, seeing what soeuer was written aforetime was written for our learning, <hi>Rom. 15. 4.</hi> it must needes be that euery sentence of the holy Scripture containeth in it (at least) one generall doctrine; and therefore the sense being once vnderstood, the next thing that is to be considered, is, the collecting of the same out of the text, in such plaine and manifest manner, as must needes be acknowledged in the conscience of the hearers to be so; which being enlarged by the examples and testimonies of the Scriptures, and manifested by the force of reason grounded vpon the same, must needes take such roote in the consciences of the hearers, as they shall either bee throughly perswaded of the trueth of it (if it be rightly and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually handled) or leaue such a print therein as shall conuince the same. Thirdly, seeing the generall doctrine is like vnto goodly meat set vpon the table before young children, which needeth to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto them, that euery one may haue his portion in due season, <hi>Mat. 24. 45.</hi> Therefore is the right vse to be propounded vnto them of the same doctrine, that it may appeare how it is profitable, either for all Christians in general, or for certaine special ones in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This is that which the Apostle meaneth when he saith, that the whole scripture is profitable to teach, (that is, to learne doctrine
<pb facs="3"/>
out of it, and not onely so, but also) to improue, (that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all errors contrary to wholsome doctrine) to correct, (that is, to reproue the mishehauiours of them that walke disorderedly) <hi>To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in righteousnes,</hi> (that is, to direct Gods people in all the wayes of godlinesse) <hi>2. Tim. 3. 16.</hi> yea and to arme vs with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort in all kindes of trouble, <hi>Rom. 15. 4.</hi> This course being taken by the Preacher shall not onely free him from the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of running out of his text, but also be so profitable for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, as experience shall prooue this kind of teaching to bee such as is not iustly to be excepted against. But is not this (will some say) a great iniurie offered vnto others that preach after another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shton, and a straightning of the giftes of Gods spirit which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, to some thus, and to others thus, and yet by the same spirite wrought to the edification of the Church of Christ? I answere, first, as concerning men, let them be assured that they haue awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the word, and aperswasion in their hearts, that the care of Gods glory and desire of edifiyng his people did lead them to their maner that they vse, and then is all this nothing against thē, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for them. Secondly, the commēding of one kind of teaching as most profitable, doth no way bound the spirit of God further then it hath pleased the Lord to limite himself by the rules of his own word. I confesse that God giueth vnto diuers men diuers measures, and to some to excell in one thing, and to some in others, for one hath an excellent dexteritie in interpreting the text; another can in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner gather doctrines; another exceedeth in application, but let it be considered that all these are branches of that method hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto commended vnto vs: so that, whosoeuer is endued with speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ability and facilitie in one of these, must labour also to performe the other aright, and not to account it a course different from his owne, further then that one doth his duetie in greater measure, and in a higher degree then another. Yet would I not so be vnderstood, as though I did affirme it of necessitie to gather euery doctrine at all times that the text may afforde, or out of euery doctrine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue both matter of reproofe, correction, instruction, patience, and comfort. For albe it I doe not doubt but that the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as God himselfe is, infinitely rich euen in euery sentence for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery branch of edification: yet seeing the deuiding of the worde of
<pb facs="4"/>
God aright, is the wisdome of the wise steward to dispence the same in due season, it belongeth to the teacher to see what is most meete &amp; expedient that way, who shall often discerne apparant necessitie to stand vpō one, when there is as euident reason to omit, or, at least, not to vrge or enlarge the other: and therefore as it is a sure groūd for the hearer to learne to discerne of and chuse his teacher by his abilitie and dexteritie in expounding the text, and gathering the doctrines out of the same; so is it hardly within his power to iudge either of his choyse of doctrines or of the vse and application that he maketh (so that he vse none but that which is found and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the text) sauing so farre as concerneth his owne edification in particular. This I am sure of (for I haue seene it in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) that the want of this way in the teacher is the cause that he often thinketh his text so barren, as hee is glad to runne into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to fill vp his time, and so maketh his labour as water spilt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a stone that neuer profiteth any, and the want of power to see who handle the word of God aright, and grace to vse their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie ordinarilie, is the cause, not onely of the gadding of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (where they may easily come to varietie of teachers) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the rents and distractions that so many fall vsually into; for if they had been seasoned with that heauēly teaching which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ministerie of him that deuideth the word of GOD aright, doth afforde, not onely their iudgements would haue been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to discerne the spirit of error when it is tendred vnto them, but also this wandering and confused kind of teaching that many do vse, would haue seemed vnsauorie vnto them.</p>
   <p>But my purpose is not, either to set downe any directions for the preacher, or to prescribe a course for the hearer, saue onely to shew, and that briefly, such a way as is proued by experience to bee most comfortable for the minister, seeing his labour thereby to be blessed, and not to be in vaine, and most profitable to the hearer, who shall thereby attaine to the greatest measure of knowledge and soundnes of iudgement. Now (because examples are the most easie way of teaching) I with the comfortable assistance of another brother, (who when this booke commeth to his hands may see his share in the trauaile therof) hauing occasion to goe thorough the two first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of these Lamentations, and the most parte of the third, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the method and matter might be not altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="4"/>
vnto others: and therefore I reuiewed the chiefe notes that we had collected from the larger discourse therof, and adding thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other two chapters haue set the whole downe in such manner as thou seest. The particulars, I confesse, as they bee set downe, are farre more briefe then when they were spoken, and more short then is meete to be vsed many publike ministerie, or expected by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different auditorie (for why should I trouble the Reader with large discourses in that which may as wel be expressed in short sentences?) seeing I haue laboured to abridge rather then to enlarge any thing, which will be as profitable to the Reader of any tolerable vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as if euery thing were amplified to the vttermost. For as to a Musitian that hath so much skill as to knowe the concords and rules of descant, it is as good a direction to haue the ground, as if he had euery seuerall poynt pricked out vnto him, seeing hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured with the manner of deuision vpon euery poynt according as it falleth out in the ground: so to him that is any thing well qualified either with the gift of teaching, beeing a minister, or of hearing with iudgement and discretion being a priuate person, this short handling of these chapters may be as plaine a direction vnto him as if euery poynt were amply enlarged.</p>
   <p>To conclude, that thou mayst the better perceiue and reape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by this present exposition, vnderstand that in al things I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for breuitie: and therfore it may peraduenture seem somwhat obscure, especially seeing how the doctrines are gathered out of the text is seldome set downe; yet for the better direction therin I haue expressed in another character the words, or at least some part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with &amp;c. out of which it doth arise. I am somwhat more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the two first chapters, then in the rest; partly because the same things did often occurre, and that now and then in the selfe same wordes; and partly that it may appeare what varietie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of matter is contayned in the holy scriptures; and yet where the greatest plenty is expressed, I haue not set downe all the doctrines that my selfe could haue collected, much lesse that which the text in it selfe contayned: for who can draw that fountain drie, which is bottomlesse? this I doe therefore say, that euery man, who either hath the calling to teach the word of God vnto his people, or prepareth himselfe to be furnished thereunto, when the Lord of the
<pb facs="5"/>
vineyarde shall set him on work may be prouoked and allured to take paynes, and to pray for a blessing vpon his labours that way, which he may haue good hope (vsing the meanes) to attaine vnto, seeing so great riches be there to be obtayned, by the handes of all those that rightly digge therein. The Lord make vs able and willing to trauaile with all carefulnes in that heauenly labour of sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the vnspeakeable treasures of knowledge and wisdome that lye hidden in his blessed worde, and vouchsafe so to blesse vs therein, as may be most to his glory, the good of his poore Church, and the endlesse comfort of our owne soules.</p>
