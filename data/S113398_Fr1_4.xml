         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t not to beleeue. And before thē
<pb facs="41"/>
the Pharisies vsed the like, who ascribed the miracles of our Sauiour and his disciples to the power of the Diuell. This all sectaries that haue bene since the beginning in the Church haue allwayes imitated, and the beret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>kes of our dayes do still verie markablie practize, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne their heresies by vttering blasphemses against the Moother of God and his Satnctes. And pullskly not onlie in their talk, but also in their writings, bragging them-selues to be Image-breakers.</p>
   <p>A certaine pamphlet in flemmish came of late to our handes printed and composed (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) by seme pernicious Caluinist of <hi>Holland</hi> against the honour donne to the Moother of God at <hi>Mountaigue.</hi> In which pamphlet he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth execrable blasphemies, he forgeth fables &amp; lyes against those of the Church, he basely scos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth at the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>tie of Princes &amp; Lordes of the Countrie, and at all such as loue and serue the glorious virgin And sinallie he endeuereth by lyes to deface and obscure the honour donne to God and his blessed Mother. Howbeit this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and all such like night-o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>les wil they wil they, must needes endure the most cleare light which e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>r lord maketh dayly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lase before our eyes, to his owne and his Moothers glorie: and through the euidence of theise miracles, they
<pb facs="41"/>
must ly trodden vnder the feet of this woman, together with the old serpent their head and captaine.</p>
   <p>And in vaine shal their labor bee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to hinder the Sunne to giue his light vnto the earth, the will of our Lord beeing such as the truth shall clerelie be seene, and pterce through the most obscure and duskie clowdes of heresies, Farre more proffitable therefore and holesome would it be for them to open the windowes of their hartes and to let these diuine beames enter in. And what beames can be more cleere or of more force, then these so palpable arguments &amp; euident demonstrations of the pure &amp; sincere veritie. Doe not these (I beseeche you) so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent miracles crie out the verie same that our Sauiour speaketh in the ghospel? <hi>If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not me, beleeue the woorks which I doe.</hi> And that which the Parents of the blynd man sayd. <hi>Enquire of him, he is of age, he will answere for him-self, he is thirtie yeares old.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These corrupters of the truth think to abuse the simple people, telling them that Catholikes woorship Idols, and that they honour the virgin Marie as if she were a goddesse, and adore Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but this is an old song so often by them chaunted, so often disputed, and in such sorte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb facs="42"/>
as there is no Catholike of so siēder indge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> who knoweth not the blessed virgin to be honored as a Patronesse and Aduocate to her Sonne and not as a Goddesse, and that the honor donne to her Image hath relation to her person and not to ber Image. And m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er that all manner of adoration whether it be <hi>Latria, Dulia,</hi> or <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> must not be taken or vnderstood according to the outward woork &amp; apparence but according to the intention of the partie from whome it proceedeth.</p>
   <p>After an other sorte this may in like manner be proffitable to Catholikes. for somuch as there are some amongst them who seeme to doubt of these miracles, for diuersmen by a certaine kynd of incredulitte, and others vpon a spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction either deny that these are miracles, or they will not beleeue, that they haue vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bene wrought. Vnto these wee must say that which our Sauiour sayd vnto <hi>Sainct Thomas. Come and feele &amp;c.</hi> Yf they will not yeeld credit to that which wee set downe, let them goe and see, and feele with their fingers, or else enquire the veritie of those who haue bene cured, for I am assured they shall fynd good store of them. And if after this they will not yet beleeue, assure your selues (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayd of those that denyed the principles of sciences) that they
<pb facs="42"/>
do it for want of witte and iudgement, or els it must be beaten into their braynes with beetles or bastinadoes.</p>
   <p>There are also others who take occasion to doubt hereof, because many hauing bene miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously cured, did not for all that obtaine their health at an instant, or at the verie place, but by litle and litle with some alteration of their bodies: vnto whome wee may by good reason answere, that to prooue a miracle it suffiseth that the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and effect be aboue the course of nature, and not by any naturall meanes or remedies: and such are all those miracles which here in this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie wee haue sette downe.</p>
   <p>Moreouer amongst these miracles some are more perfit and notable then some others are: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the more notable are esteemed those, when the diseases are cured at the verie same instant, whereof wee haue verie many, and yet the others are not without miracle, although they haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in successe of tyme, because they were wrought aboue the course of nature.</p>
   <p>For who is he that will or can deny that whē our Lord cured the blynd man it was a true and perfit miracle? who at the beginning saw men walke like trees, yet no man doubteth that he afterward receiued his perfit sight.</p>
   <p>Neither is it any wayes repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="43"/>
of a miracle that at the tyme of their healing they feel a change or alteration either in their soules or in their bodies: for (not alleaging the other reasons which wee will set downe in the ensuing historie) who is he that knoweth of those whome our Lord &amp; his saints miraculously cured did not feel the like also in them selues? No au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor nor wryter denieth or affirmeth that they were restored to their health without such altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And for so much as those miracles were wrought principalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for the confirmation of our faith, it suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed only to set downe the bare truth without further expressing the circumstances, or what other thinges els therin occurred. Our Lord recounted his miracles to the disciples of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> (who doubted whether he were the true Messias or no) without making any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circūstance▪ or other qualities, saying: <hi>Go, tell vnto Iohn. The blynde see, the lame vvalk, the deaf heare, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous are made cleane,</hi> giuing vs therby to vnderstand that such cures (although he had sayd nothing) yeelded certaine &amp; infallible proof that he was the true Messias. And whē wee heare, see, and feel the like to be donne by the merits &amp; intercession of the glorious mother of God at the Mountaine of Mountaigue, who is hee that is so wilfully blynd as will not acknowlege the holy
<pb facs="43"/>
Catholike Romaine Church adorned and honored with such signes &amp; miracles, to be the only spouse of Christ, the doue and beloued of our Lord, the fortresse and piller of truthe, in whoms onlie true and perfit miracles are to be found?</p>
   <p>Awake therefore (O you misledde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies) open the eyes of your vnderstanding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light wherwith the God of mercies vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>safeth to lighten the darknes of your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and ignorances. Yf he had not publikly wrought these signes and miracles that none but he is able to woork, perhaps this misguided people might in some sorte be excused: but seeing they haue had so great and manifest signes and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they shalbe inexcusable in that they do not woork their owne conuersions.</p>
   <p>And you faithful Catholikes who for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of our enemies, or euill successe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of our religion, or for the abuses and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiō in the life &amp; māners of those of the Church or layetie, are wont to stagger or be faint-harted, confirme and settle your selues hereby: you are in <hi>S.
