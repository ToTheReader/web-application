   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is euident vnto all men, diligently reading holy Scripture, and ancient Authors, that from the Apostles time, there hath beene these orders of Ministers in Christs Church, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Priests, and Deacons, which offices were euermore had in such reuerent estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no man by his owne priuate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, might presume to execute any of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee were first called, tried, examined and knowne to haue such qualities, as were requisite for the same, and also by publique prayer, with imposition of hands, approued and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. And therefore, to the intent these orders should bee continued, and reuerently vsed and esteemed in this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it is requisite that no man (not being at this present, Bishop, Priest, nor Deacon) shall execute any of them, except he bee called, tried, examined, and admitted, according to the forme hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. And none shall be admitted a Deacon, except hee bee twenty one yeeres of age at the least. And euery man which is to bee admitted a Priest, shall bee full foure and twenty yeeres old. And euery man which is to be consecrated a Bishop, shall be fully thirty yeeres of age. And the Bishop knowing, either by himselfe, or by sufficient testimony, any person to be a man of vertuous conuersation, and without crime, and after examination and triall, finding him learned in the Latine tongue, and sufficiently instructed in holy Scripture, may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sunday or Holy day, in the face of the Church, admit him a Deacon, in such manner and forme as hereafter followeth.</p>
