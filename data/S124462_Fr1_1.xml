   <p>forcible, we are therefore in good time, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of our life, to prouide, and to make prouision for those things that are necessarie for vs, at the time of our death, for to furnish and to fence vs against the great forces that the diuell will then make against vs, euen for the carrying of vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: knowing this for a certaintie, that if he then faile, that then there is no place left for him, and that he must needs for shame, leaue, and giue vp his siege, without any hope of euer returning anymore. Now the armour &amp; weapons wherwith we are principally to defend our selues, are faith, and the word of God: faith, by which we lay hold vpon the grace and fauour of God, and vpon the righteousnes of Iesus Christ, to be vnto vs insteede of a buckler and target, to couer and to defend vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the venimous and fierie darts of this mortall and bitter enimie: and the word, couragiously and manfully to set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and to foile him, as did our Sauiour Iesus Christ. For there are but these two meanes, whereby we can either defend our selues, or driue backe his forces, and so
<pb facs="2"/> get the full victorie ouer him. Which is the caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> (my brethren) why I haue collected and gathered out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, certaine fit places to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>fort and to confirme you against those tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherewith you may be assaulted at the verie point and moment of death. But I beseech you, not to deferre vntill this last houre, to learne and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish your selues in these thinges, doing herein, as doe foolish Captaines, who put off the furnishing of the places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, with that that is necessarie for the garding and keeping thereof, vntill such time as they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed and compassed about with men of warre that are their foes: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it oftentimes commeth to passe, that seeing themselues destitute and bereft of necessarie meanes, and instruments to defend themselues, and for this cause finding themselues amazed and astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> that the winter following you may be well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for all thinges that shall be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the passing thereof, and for the easie vndergo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ing of the roughnesse and sharpnesse of it. And aboue all, marke I beseech you, in the treatise that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and send vnto you, those places that are alledged against distrust and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption: for they are two capitall and principall temptations, that Sathan or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie vseth for the battering and ouerthrowing of vs, setting before our eyes, either the multitude and greatnes of our sinnes, for to throw vs headlong into a distrust of the mercie of God, or else our vertues and good workes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and to puffe vs vp with a vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and perswasion of them. Those are (saith saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) the two cords, wherewith this hangman, Sathan, continuallie vseth to stifle and to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle men, if they take not heede of him. But it shall be easie for you to preuent and to meete with these daungers, if that on the one side you oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="3"/> that which is spoken in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, concerning the corruption and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of men, for to humble them: and on the other side, that which is said, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the infinite mercie and grace of God, for to assure them of their saluation. I trust that with the helpe of God, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in writing vnto you this litle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, and yours in the diligent reading of it, shall not be vnprofitable, So be it.</p>
