   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y friendlie and welbeloued brethren, when I did consider with my selfe the great defect and imbecilitie which doth remain amongst our Companie, for lacke of learning in the speculatiue part, of this worthie art of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie, which chieflie doth appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same. And considering with my selfe what great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and infamie hath growen to our Companie thereby, I haue not bene a little carefull to remoue the same thinges from vs. And considering with my selfe also, that these things cannot be remoued but by knowledge, and that knowledge cannot come, but by reading and hearing, and reading is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, except it be vnderstood. Therefore I haue with great diligence collected and gathered together these foure bookes of Galen, called Therapeuticon, &amp; being trāslated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the English tongue, I haue dedicated the same vnto you, to that end, that you may with the like diligēce &amp; studie, receiue pleasure, profit, &amp; great commoditie, by these bookes which I heere deliuer vnto you with painfull trauaile, great cares, &amp; charges: But when I did consider these diuine &amp; most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bookes, how profitable &amp; cōmodious the same should be vnto you, I saie, not onelie to you, but to the whole common wealth of our Countrie, &amp; what great honor shuld grow vnto mine owne natural Country men hereby, &amp; also what furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; increase of knowledge it shal be vnto those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this art. I neither regarded monie nor profit, nor passed for anie paines, but yeelded my carefull studie to serue your turne, in this most diuine worke. And moreouer, I thought it my bounden dutie, to helpe to raise vp that most famous mā Galen, who hath lien so long buried with that foule monster Obliuion, from the knowledge of our natural tongue, so that worthelie he hath deserued immortall fame. Now my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there are three speciall points that are to be considered.
<pb n="40" facs="46"/> The first is, to whom you do minister, and to what end your ministration serueth. The second is, with what thinges you doe minister, and what methode you ought to keepe in the time of your ministration. The third is, what manner of knowledge ye ought to haue that will cure methodicallie and rightlie, by his ministration. To whom this Artist doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, it is easilie knowen, for he doth minister to mans body, which is subiect vnto the art of Medicine, and the end and affect of his ministration, is to cure mans bodie of such hurts and diseases, as the same bodie is anoyed and troubled with. The second doth consist in those things that you cure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and they be three, that is to saie, conuenient diet, or as wee may tearme it, conuenient gouernment of the sicke patient, and conuenient medicaments, apt and meete for the disease, and also an apt and conuenient person methodicallie &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to vse these two. The third is, what manner of knowledge this person ought to haue. Galen doth verie well describe his knowledge in these bookes, against that foolish bragging Thesalus, how he would take vpon him in sixe moneths, to make a man perfect in this arte, and yet he himselfe but a Woolman, or as we may tearme him, a Spinner and carder of wooll, whose foolish stupiditie was such, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Hyppocrates and Galen, and therfore Galen hath written against him in all these bookes, not onelie condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, but condemning all other ignorant persons, which vnderstand not the principles of this arte, and speciallie other Artists, as Carpenters, Smiths, Cookes, Weauers, and women, which doth leaue their owne honest occupations, wherein they haue bene brought vp, and dooth arrogantlie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuouslie take vpon them this most worthie arte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they be vtterlie ignorant, and if they cure anie thing, it is by chaunce, and not by methode, as you may perceiue in his first booke.</p>
   <p>There is also another thing to be noted, that Galen doth not make such diuisions betwixt wounds and vlcers, as wee commonlie doe, for hee dooth name all those that commeth with solution, or separation of the skinne. Elkos in Greeke, that is to saie, an vlcer.</p>
   <pb facs="47"/>
   <p>But if you doe diligentlie consider Galens method, as in the curation you shall finde it most excellent, and which is to bee vnderstoode an vlcer, and which a wound, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Now there resteth no more but your painfull trauaile and studie heerein, and euerie one of you brotherlie and friendlie, to haue conference herein one with another, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the true meaning shal be the better vnderstood, &amp; you your selues shal receiue it the better into your perpetual memory.</p>
   <p>Thus I take my leaue of you, requiring of you no rewards, but true and faithfull good will, &amp; louing words, with friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie furtherance, desiring the almightie Lord to preserue and keepe you, and send you the knowledge in this worthie Arte, to the profit of the common wealth.</p>
