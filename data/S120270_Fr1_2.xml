      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Trust (Madame) the alone names of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Beza, which is the honourable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this litle booke, will not alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it a reuerende welcome into your hands, but withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all men will both warrant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the translators price to be woorth his labour, as that which will recompence his fewe spent houres, with the much profite and pleasure of many. For, besides the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon helpe it brings to all, for more cleare understanding and expounding those eight psalmes: it is singularly medicinable to wounded and cast downe consciences, who after their labor some combate with sinne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd profitable humiliation there through, nay againe by these sweete Meditations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rise with ioy, finding happie issue of their
<pb facs="3"/>troubles. And this, as it was my simple iudgement vpon first reading, euen so is it my comfortable experience vpon reading and reading againe. Which was one thing that made me, among others, to thinke of you, good Madame, as to whose tender conscience it might be welcomly applyed. But what neede that holy Prophet, and this reuerend Pastor, this my worde of poore credite? It is as if the least Pleiade would affoord some poore helpe of light to Sunne and Moone: I must learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to come downe, and know mine owne place, acknowledging my selfe to borrowe or begge both light and credite from them, if I may be vouchsafed but the fauour of a stammering trucheman to so worthy an Hebrew, and to such a Frenchman. Vpon both whose warrantise (as it were) a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voucher, I wholy relye and rest secure for sufficient approofe of the matter of my translation. Nowe a worde or two for this dedication, wherein my choise was not so much to content my selfe, but to goe rather as neere as possible to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Authours own verie meaning. He first purposed it to a Ladie, preuented by her death, gaue it yet to a Ladie, &amp; that to a Ladie <hi>Anne Bacon,</hi> wife to that Lorde late of great honour, &amp; for euer of Christian fame, Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi> Knight, father to Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi> Knight, husband to this Ladie <hi>Anne Bacon.</hi> Being therfore by this meanes still continued in the selfe same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ne of the Ladie <hi>Anne Bacon,</hi> wife also to
<pb facs="3"/>Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> and that in the same house, so néere, as from fathers wife to sonnes wife: I halfe presume vpon, and yet humbly crane leaue of that learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Anne Bacon,</hi> to whom the Authour did first appropriate it, that as shee was once one with the father, and by him hath déere pledges: So shée will not thinke this any impropriation, but in her good affection to all that house, suffer them to receiue by her the honour of some particular interest with her in so sweete a labour of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour: who in his Epistle makes most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable memorie of her husbande, and giues testimonie of good reputation to her sonne. Although therefore, I confesse my selfe of verie duty to loue al that good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoode, first for their loue to the trueth, with other agreeable vertues of wisedome and true honestie, and then for that loue which it pleaseth euery one of thē (I wote not howe without my merit) kindly to beare me: yet in giuing this to their eldest brothers wife, and so to them all, I neither giue them nor pay them ought, but yéeld them their owne, and which I might not haue giuen to any other, vnlesse beyond the right of a translator, I would haue taken vpon me to translate that into a strange familie, which seemes as a very heirloome properly belonging to <hi>Bacon</hi> house.</p>
   <p>So wishing you (good Madame) most happie going forward in a simple hearted profession of Gods Eospell to the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample of your owne houshold, and a shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="4"/>light among your neighbours: I the least of them, beseech the Lorde Iesus to blesse you and Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> together with his mease of religious brethren, so as growing in faith and loue, they may be a fast holding bundle of brethren in Christ, who keepe you all euer his, and one anothers. From Th. <hi>31.</hi> May. <hi>1582.</hi>
