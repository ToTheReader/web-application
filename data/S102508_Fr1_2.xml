<pb facs="5"/> incurre the dangers of imprisonment, of losse of landes, forfeytures of their goods or death it selfe.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Many haue greater care of mortal mens laws then of Gods lawes.</note>But the mighty God, the only high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Law-giuer, that Lord of Lordes, and King of all Kings, Let him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne, publish, and proclaime his Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinances, to be hearkned vnto, obserued, and kept, and that vnder neuer so rigorous and Seuere conditions, punishments, and penalties: How few men will search his Booke of Statutes and Lawes? How few are affraid of his, not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, but euerlasting threatninges and punishments, contained in his Lawes? and how few men regard, esteeme, and thankfully embrace his couenant of reconciliation, set forth in his most ioyfull, and comfortable Gospell?</p>
   <p>And yet most certaine it is, that all these aforesaid things so much to bee wondred at, and so greatly to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for: so lightly looked on, so
<pb facs="5"/> smally regarded, and so little thought on, &amp; many such other of the like fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity and order of disorders, &amp; sins being delighted in, and securely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, without all care or indeauour to forsake them in time, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; true returning to the Lord, doe first breed or in gender, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bring forth Desperation; then the which, all the Furies, and Diuells in hell, cannot lightly excogitate nor find out a greater torment or a more intolerable paine, and that because that all other torments, penalties, and paines are but temporall, and pursue men no further then bodily death; but this endeth not with bodily death, but becommeth eternall. Whosoeuer then he bee, that is once surely catcht in this net of desperation, hee needes no mo accusers to come against him, then his former vnrepented sinnes, which lye at the doore to arrest him; his owne heart will giue euidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and his owne iniquity
<pb facs="6"/> wil plead him to be guilty, and that to his owne face.</p>
   <p>Vpon consideration of these things I haue now in this treatise following, (good Christian Reader) endeuoured my selfe to set downe, First, a definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Desperation; then the grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof: after this, certaine principall causes thereof: together with remedies for the same: and lastly a generall preseruatiue against Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, arising of what cause soeuer: To the intent, that the Children of GOD, falling by some occasions into some degrees of it, (for if it rage in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, in the opinion of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writers, it is an euill incurable, and vnrecouerable) may with the more case and quietnesse bee recouered, and saued as it were out of the Diuels clawes; euen out of as great danger as euer were the poore Sheepe that <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke out of the Beares or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mouth.<note place="margin">1 Sa, 17.</note>
