   <p>FOr that some of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> favourites wanting colour to excuse altogither the fowlenesse of his fact, doe yet inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to qualifie the same in what measure they can, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he being a young man, was provoked, and stirred vp by evill words to commit that in the heat of his bloud which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies he would neuer haue committed: And some others beeing themselues either of a loose conversation, or at the least enemies to the Ministerie of the Gospel, would seeme to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the crime, by imputing it, as a iust reward due, not only to the party murthered, but also to the most of his calling for their over-bold checking, and (as they tearme it) domineering over their betters, because indeede, they reproue the generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that so abound in every corner: And least also it might happily be surmised by some indifferently affected, that many things in this relation might partially proceede in favour of the dead man from some of his friendes, it is therefore thought fit for the better satisfying of the later sorte, to assure them that there is nothing set downe, but that which is to bee iustified by very sufficient proofe: and for the better answering of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer scandalls, and such like, here be annexed the testimony (as it were) of fowre substantiall Iuries, which speake of their credit what they knew concerning the man. The first doth consist of the better sort of his parishioners where hee remained: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the chiefe of such Ministers among whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: the thirde of the worshipfull in the countrey to whom hee was best knowne: and the fourth, of the learned in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie where he was brought vp.</p>
