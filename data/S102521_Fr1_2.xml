   <head>The Authors caueatory <hi>Epistle to the vnderstanding</hi> Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntelligent and indifferent Readers: The frequent vse of new Bookes should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a meanes to conserue in memory all materiall occurrences; but likewise to preserue for posterity such Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of remarkable prescription, as might easily induce (with an vntyred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) the mind of the Peruser. My selfe therefore (hauing in the small iournall of my life beene acquainted with sundry pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the world) shal fairely hope these collections to my Country men, will not proue altogether fruitlesse. The worke in it selfe is of no great substance, not much
<pb facs="3"/>Satyricall nor Criticall; it onely glances, like the dogs of <hi>Nilus,</hi> taking a lap here and there, and not dwelling long vpon any subiect. And because many men, are lesse offensiuely reprehended by a conceited iesting reproofe, then a serious; I haue adapted it in the way of Characters, with a Language of sutable familiarity. They may haply appeare at first view a meere congested Chaos of confused Chimer as, the Ideas or fantasmas of an Epidemicke Braine; yet on receipt of the least warmth from the Sun-beames of your fauourable opinions, they shall easily dissipate all foggy mists of erronious misprision, and be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clarified in your considerate censure; for though you may deeme them somewhat promiscuously handled; I can well assure you my meaning herein was more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall. That I present you with no curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pourtrait of Cosmographicall or Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologicall relation, my slender reading in History▪ an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> lesse iudgement in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks may easily approue. Onely I
<pb facs="3"/>offer at the shrine of your serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, this small peece of Charactery, comprising the Natures, Arts, Humors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd dispositions of men. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and your greater contentments I haue madly rambled through Court, City Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Vniuersity, &amp;c If in the due forme of a Character, I haue either ouer roued, flowne wide, or fallen short, it's not vnlike you may impute it to my folly of precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In this (I excusiuely make answer.) I shall not vnfitly resemble the Painter, who being to figure forth the fury of a mad dogge, the better to expresse it, stood long curiously pidling about the froth or fome issuing from his mouth; but finding nothing frame fitly to his intention; rashly takes vp his pencill, dashes it against the Picture, minding to spoyle it: howbeit this sudden Accident preuailed to make his worke more excellent. So haply may I in these sudden Touches pencill out these meane Characters with a more liuely tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, than if I had beene tediously curious
<pb facs="4"/>in contriuing, or vainly vainglorious to embelish them with the quaint eare-hony of finest elocution. The world you know is at this time oppressed with nothing more then the Presse▪ euery one striuing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> dewie Quintessence of his braine, through the Limbecke of inuention. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, you see, I haue not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sequestred my selfe; but set apart some time from matters more serious, to collect such simples as may extract from my iuyce-barren Quill some few drops of your desired approbation. If I may be fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest so fairely, I shall futurely be encourae ged to exemplifie these in a choycer strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or amplifie to a competent number others, with a more pleasing variety. In the meane time for my present perclose and to stop the mouth of malicious malignitie, who may without cause be exceptious: I onely alleage this, I haue not searched deeply into any mans matters, a little I confesse I haue touched their manners, and perhaps started their humors; which
<pb facs="4"/>if it proue currant to the curteous, I minde not the captious. But if it bee generally mislikt, as not answering your expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I conclude thus, if you be sory it is no better, you may be glad it is no longer.</p>
