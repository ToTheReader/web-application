   <head>A Postscript.</head>
   <p>CYPRIAN in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath these words:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Arum est, &amp;c.</hi> It is a small matter, that wee stirre vp the people of GOD
<pb n="276" facs="154"/>with the Trumpet of our voice, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse also, by les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons taken out of Gods Word, wee strengthen the faith of Beleeuers, and their vertue which is dedicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted vnto GOD. And what doth more suit with our (Pastorall) care, than that, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exhortations, wee fence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="277" facs="154"/>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs of God, and the Armie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the heauenly camp, against the batterie and darts of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? For a souldier cannot bee fit for warre, if he be not first trained in the field; And hee that would get the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by wrestling, yet shall not bee crowned, if he doe
<pb n="278" facs="155"/>not first practise, and trie his skill, and strength. It is an old Aduersarie, and an ancient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, with whom wee must combat. Six thousand yeers are almost finished,
<note place="margin">This he wrote about the yeere of the world 5457. <hi>Euseb. August. Oros. Sulpit. Scuerus.</hi> But there seemes to be an error</note> since the deuill did set vpon mankind. So that now, by his long standing, and great experience, he hath learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly all sorts of
<pb n="279" facs="155"/>temptations, and all the feats and snares of destroying. If hee ouertake the souldier of Christ vnprepared, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and watchfull with his whole minde, he circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents him vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and deceiues him in his simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But if a man keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of
<pb n="280" facs="156"/>God, and stoutly cleaue to the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Christ, and then shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand &amp; resist him, he must needs bee ouercome; because Christ whom wee professe, is inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
   <p>See heere (Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader) the consent of this ancient Father, and glorious Martyr of Christ, to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine. If thou receiuest the testimony
<pb n="281" facs="156"/>of man; know the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But bee sure by all these admonitions, to buckle on thy harnesse, &amp; looke for this grand enemie, and resist him. Leaue this intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so much with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aduersaries, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this principall principally. For, what will it auaile thee, to be free from men, and in bondage to the deuill? what good, to Lord it in earth, and be guilty of hell fire? to conspire with thine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
<pb n="282" facs="157"/>heart, abused by the deuill (where the end will bee death eternall) and discouer the treacheries of men, to their vtter disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace? Will this quit cost? Call therefore thy thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> homeward. Looke to thine owne house,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.20.</note> and blesse it. Marke the possessions and strong holds of the strong man, and cast him out. If he deceiue thee, how great is that deceit? Thrice vnhappy is that man, and more, who
<pb n="283" facs="157"/>liues too well knowne to others, and dies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to himselfe. It had beene good for that man, if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene borne.</p>
   <p>One alarme more, and so I lay aside my Trumpet. Resist the deuill, resist, resist: not scorne, but resist: and resist him in all wicked motions whatsoeuer: resist him by the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons appointed, the armour of God; resist him early, stoutly, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally, wisely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly: Bee carefull herein, and iealous, that
<pb n="284" facs="158"/>thou resistest not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: And remember that thou hast not yet resisted vnto bloud, striuing against sin; and prouide so to doe. The Lord giue thee a heart and courage hereunto, and afterward set the crowne of victory on thy head. Amen.</p>
