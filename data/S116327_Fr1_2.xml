      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hose notes vvhich vvere lately vvritte forth for your priuate vse, I am now emboldned to make more common; not for any conceited worth in them,
<pb facs="3"/> but to auoid the trouble, of yeelding satisfaction to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good friends, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire &amp; expect the like office from me. I am sure herein I shall hurt none, but my selfe; nor so much as offend any, excepting those for whose vse the publishing heereof was neuer intended.</p>
   <p>Your Ladiships fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptance of them in priuate, hath made them the bolder to come foorth in publike, and to grace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the profession of your fauour, which is their greatest ornament.</p>
   <p>I hope that you, who haue giuen them some intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your closet, will not carelesly passe by them as vnknowne, now they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselues vnto you in
<pb facs="3"/> the street: the rather for that they come not alone, but accompanied, assisted and countenanced with a most profitable Treatise of the same Argument, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long since by one whom your Ladiship reuerenceth, and whose person and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the work of Christ Iesus, are (and that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly) much esteemed of the people of God.</p>
   <p>I shall not need to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you of the vse of either of these Treatises: Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, how little soeuer, are in that point able to speake for themselues. Onely take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="4"/> brought vnto any wicked and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adoration thereof.</p>
   <p>Thus vnfainedly praying the Lord, more and more to blesse the worthy Knight your husband, and your self, and from heauen to reward those many fauors receiued from you both, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
