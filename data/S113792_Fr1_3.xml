<pb facs="7"/>
being left alone, they are now presented to thee in this little <hi>Manuell:</hi> They were left written with his owne hand, and Preached in one of the Schooles of the Prophets, and so fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a learned Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. That which did sway with me in the Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these, and rhose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sermons of his that are already brought forth into publike view, next to the desire of the publike good, was the feare of wrong that both the Church and Authour might sustaine by the publishing of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Coppies: Those private and imperfect Coppies which passed
<pb facs="7"/>
from hand to hand, did runne the hazzard of a surreptitious Edition, I clearely saw for some of them, and had just cause to suspect it in the rest, that if I would not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them others would, they falling into the hands of some mercinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose boldnesse is such, as that it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, eirher by the good of the Church, or credit of the Author, whilst they looke no higher than their owne private gaine, which is all their godlinesse, though many times their immaginary gaine, proves their reall losse.</p>
   <p>What is here presented
<pb facs="8"/>
to thee, is intirely the Authors owne, without adding the least tittle to them, least my Addition should detract from them. They are now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for the ingenious Readers benefit, and not the Critickes censure, and are recommended not to a bare reading, but to thy practise. The blessing of these labours I commend to him that alone must give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: and the God of Heaven give a rich bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to them for thy soules good.</p>
