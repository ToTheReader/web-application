   <head>A PREFACE TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oe heere I present vnto thee (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) a continuation of the booke of all the famous Battailes, fought in our age, and I doe hope with better hap than the first came forth, if the Printer haue done his dutie in reforming the faults noted and corrected in his proues. For as for the first part it was so maimed, mangled, and marred by the Printer, I will not saie of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but certes of pride and negligence, that I like a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mother, that had her faire child foulie deformed through the negligence, or mallice of a lewde Nurse, in manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sware mine owne child, bidding the Printer take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and father it on whom hee list, so he gaue it not mine name, for I would neuer acknowledge it for mine owne, but account it a changeling. But letting this matter passe, which is pleasant neither for thee to heare, nor for me to rehearse: perhaps you long to know what nouelties I do now bring: forsooth, certaine Battailes mentioned in the first parte, but not there described, because I had then no good author to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that had set them forth at large, but all the rest are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes fought since the publication of the first part, vnlesse it be two, which were set downe in the first booke, but since that time hauing chanced vppon farre larger and better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, I haue inserted them in this later part. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the battailes do deserue a verie perticular &amp; exact descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they which of al other were best fought: the first is the battel of Dreux in France, the other a battel in the leuāt seas,
<pb facs="3"/>where the confederate Christians, vnder the conduct of Don Iohn de Austria, discomfited the fleete and forces of the Turke: the which battaile I called in my first part, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of Lepanto, and now in my latter, the battaile of Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherias, and no doubt in both places falselie. For it was not fought in the gulfe of Lepanto, but in another gulfe neere therevnto, which you shall finde perticularlie described in this booke, but not named neither by mine author, nor by anie Geographer that I can light on: and therefore for lacke of a true name, I call it the battaile of Pescherias, of the forelong that adioyneth to the gulfe, and where the two Nauies first descried each other, beeing then too neere to retire, without apparant perill, if either of them had had that cowardlie minde and intention.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, in the description of euerie battaile, I haue, as also in the first part, followed alwayes some one certaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whome I thought had best of all other done it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enterlacing or adding of anie contradictions or scholies out of other writers, vnlesse it be in the Portugall battailes: where to take awaie all coulour of quarrell from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I haue adioyned notes out of the booke, intituled: The Explanation of the true and lawfull right of Anthonie king of Portugall, because the common opinion is, that it was not published without the kings priuitie: and therefore I would haue made that booke my sole author in the enarration of those battailes, if it had perticularlie at large described them, as it doth but summarilie touch them. But the reason why I did not the like in the rest is: first, because I would auoide confusion (for hardlie shall you finde two authors that doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the description of one battaile,) and secondarilie and principallie, because I would not be reputed the author of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing set down in this booke, but onelie the bare transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor &amp; reporter of it in English: leauing the credite of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in these books vnto their authors, whose names I haue prefixed in the front of euerie battaile, as also I haue done
<pb facs="3"/>in the table. So that if any vntruth shalbe here found (which God forbid) the fault is not mine, vnlesse I haue bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised, and carelesse in the choice of myne auctors: the which I hope I am farre from. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore courteous Reader, seing that I haue taken paines for to pleasure and profit thee, speake well of mee, and so fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
