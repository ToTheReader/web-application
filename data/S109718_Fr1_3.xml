   <head>The preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is to admonishe the
gentle reader that if before
this time thou haste not red
this boke, and commest ther
vnto as an ignorant person
that thou beware of geuing
any credite or faith vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the blasphemous lies and Miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
herin, whiche are not possible to be true
they are so directly againe the moost precious
&amp; holy word of god. And first thou shalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stād
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> there is a boke in latin entitled &amp; named
<hi>Liber Couform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>tatum.</hi> That is to say the boke
of the rules of the barefote Friers, conteining
a wagō or cartful of fables and blasphemous
doctrines againste Christ &amp; true religiō, out of
the whiche these few thinges herafter menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in this treatise is excerpted &amp; gathered.</p>
   <p>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd euen at the first in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> praier that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Friers
make to Frances, thou maiest se how horrible
idolatry they commit in attributing to Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that onely aperteineth to christe, whiche is
the remission of sinnes and the rewarde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
lif. They apply also al the Figures
of the old Testament to aperteine to Frances
&amp; so they shadow and hide Christ, and auance
Frances farre aboue christ. Of this it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that Christ is but a Figure of Frances
(as the Turk thinketh) &amp; that figured Frāces
is al in all, whereof springeth this heresy that
Frances is the very true Messias, mediatour
aduocate &amp; patrone y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they cal vpō, and of him
thei ask euerlasting life. who hath hard greter
blasphemy, ād what is this but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> falsifieng &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>
denieng of the scriptures of god spokē of his
sonne Iesu christ, which saith Ihon. x. I geue
them euerlasting life. Whatsoeuer ye ask the
father in my name he wil geue it you, i Ihō. ii
We haue an aduocate with the father whiche
is Iesus christ the iust. &amp;c. i. Ti. ii. There is
but one mediator betwene god and man euen
Iesu christ. &amp;c. Wherfore christiā reader whē
thou hast wel considered these thinges, weigh
them as earnest matters, and god graunt that
we may so weigh them in hart and mind that
we may detest and abhorre suche abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
and to cleaue fast to Christ. Amen.</p>
   <p>YET here resteth to be told what should
moue me now at this time (Friers beyng ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
from hence and their wicked doynges
and doctrines worthely condempned) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe
and imprint this treatise: certainly two
thinges, first for that it was first gathered ād
set furth in highe Dutche by. D. M. Luther &amp;
after by an other great lerned man translated
out of dutche into latin, &amp; likewise imprinted
and set fourth after that Friers were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in Germany. And the same cause that I
thinke moued them, doth now likewise cause
me to imprint thesame, which is this, after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
light &amp; knowlege of gods holy word had, ther
is litle perrel to bring furth false &amp; erronious
doctrines, for that so sone as they come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> light therof they are espied &amp; iudged, like
as in the darke though a manne be very well
furnished of weapons hable to defend himself
<pb facs="3"/>
from his enemie, yet for lack of light he loseth
the right vse of them, for that hee may misse
his enemy and hurt his frend, &amp; hauing lighte
and his weapons also, hee defendeth himself, &amp;
saueth his frend and vanquisheth his enemy.
So now that God hathe geuē vs the light of
the knowledge of his mooste holy and sacred
woord, &amp; hath indued vs with the weapons &amp;
armor of hys holy spirite, wee nede not feare
the Deuel our enemye nor his doctrines, but
may boldly loke vpon him in the day light and
ouercome &amp; confound him and al his: &amp; this as
a special &amp; principal thing shal we herby haue
great cause to reioyse and praise god for, in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
of his great merci he hath deliuered vs from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
blindnes &amp; bondage of those papistical Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers,
&amp; that we may now laugh to scorn such
folish and filthy doctrine, as in the time of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
we beleued and worshiped for truth.</p>
   <p>An other cause is this, that I se a great nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
which rather delite in lies &amp; vanities, and
therwith to pas their time, then with the liuely
&amp; most fuitful worde of God And for such: I
thought this a mete boke, that by the lies her
in conteined they may confound &amp; condempne
their awne ignorance whych at thys Daye by
lies is and hath ben established, ād that therby
they may be ocasioned to desier further kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and come to the light of gods moost holy
word which euery christen man ought
most ioyfully and gladly
to embrace</p>
