   <head>TO THE Right honorable <hi>William Rider,</hi> Lord Maior of the <hi>citie of London.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I haue read, that newely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of <hi>Alexander</hi> the greate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="3"/>
of his subiectes, as well of the Nobilitie, as meaner condition, did present his greatnesse, with such giftes as their abilities could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, to manifest the na ture of their loue, or seruice: among all which, a poore Mason, not so rich as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in his Arte; and yet as willing as any, in some token of his seruice, to make some manifestation of his humble loue, brought into
<pb facs="3"/>
the Court a bagge full of stones; but what they were, or how they were wrought, was not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to anie, neither would hee let any man see them, till hee was brought vnto the Emperour: where, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a table, hee laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him his owne Image, but in so deade a colour, as if hee were to be laid in his graue, with these words written vpon his breaste,
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Talis eris.</hi> Diuers of his Court, at the beholding thereof, began to frowne at the poore Mason, that hee durst at such a time of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing triumphes, present his Maiestie with a picture of such melancholy: but the Emperour, taking by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of Gods holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a gratious apprehension of the poore mans loue, not only did thankfully accept the present, which he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be set vp in his owne
<pb facs="4"/>
chamber, euer after, as a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual glasse for him euening &amp; morning, &amp; at all houres to looke vpon, but after a bountifull reward, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him for his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, vsed these wordes of him vnto al those that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in his presence: Here are many of yee, that I am beholding to, for many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of your loue and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, but chiefely vnto this man: for some of yee haue beene sent by your fathers,
<pb facs="5"/>
some, by your friends, some from your own spirits, with such thinges as ye haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented: but this man neither from father, friend, nor from himselfe; but onely from God of heauen was sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, not with a toy to delight mee, nor a Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to enrich mee, but with a continual warning, not to sinke in the delight of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor to trust in the drosse of this worldly treasure, but in the greatest of my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="5"/>
to humble my selfe, to him that is greater than I, &amp; who hauing made me greate, can bringe mee to nothing at all; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, I am, or may be, doth she we mee what in the end I shall be. Thus farre of this historie I haue set downe for my purpose. Your Lordship, newly stept vp vnto the state of Honour, I know shall be followed with many friends, and gratified with many presents, which I know you
<pb facs="6"/>
will not receiue vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but among all, I beseech you not to refuse, at the hands of an humble heart, the passionate meditations of a patient spirite: which, in the Euening, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at all houres, if your Lordshippe wil vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe at your leasure to looke vpon, yee shall see, that whosoeuer hath come to you, and whatsoeuer is brought you, GOD that
<pb facs="6"/>
set mee to worke, hath sent mee vnto you, to present you with such a glasse, as will shewe the great comfort of his grace. By which I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech his eternall Maiestie, to guide your thoughtes, wordes, and deedes, to his infinite glorie, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of her Maiestie, the increase of your owne Honour, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all that loue you:
<pb facs="7"/>
among whome, the least worthie to bee named, I humbly rest</p>
