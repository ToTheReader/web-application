the Housekeeper. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth

Who traineth vp children &amp; seruants
in the feare of God, and seruice of the
Commonwealth, and common good?
the Housholder. Who norisheth Arts,
Learning, and them that serue at the
Altar? but the Housholder that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Tythes. Who maintaineth the
world, and defendeth the Countrey?
the Housholder; who hauing a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
loueth it thrice so well as the

Who is a monster among men? hated,
of God, disdained of the angels, shame
of his Parents, &amp; burden to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but he that liueth, by whom no
other liueth; that is, no Housholder,
and yet rich enough: no liker a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
then an Ape is like a man, whose
flesh is not good for meat, as a sheepes,
nor his back for burthen, as the horse
and Asse, nor skins for warmth and
Ornament, as the Conies, Squirrels,
and Martins, nor good to keep a house
as a Bandogge. <hi>Simia quam similis,
turpissima bestia nobis.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>You renowned Housholders, that
loue this kind of life, purge out of your

or else your honor is in the dust, in the

if you suffer your families to be dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

         <hi>Ebriosus est volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
daemon, ruinae excusatione ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,

A drunkard is a willfull
Deuill, the shame of mankinde, and
one that cannot be excused in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Neuer shall drunkard come
to heauen, for as when the Shippe is
sunke after a Tempest, the wares and
lading are quickely washed out, but
the barke is filled with sand and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so as all the strength of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
weigh it vp againe, nor the best
Nauigator, and sailes make it sayle
againe: no more when a man is once
sunke in drunkennesse (and sinke hee
shall, for the Deuil wil not leaue him,
till with the Swine in the Gospell, he
drown thē:) al the perswasions of God
&amp; man cannot set him vpright again
in the Sea of this worlde. For like to
<hi>Bonosus</hi> the drunkē Emp. <hi>Nati sunt
vt bibant, non vt viuant,</hi> they are
borne to drink and not to liue. It hath
bin lawfull to put away a mans wife
<pb facs="16"/>
for drunkennesse among some Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but it is needfull that drunkards
be excluded mens company, &amp; with
<hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> liue among beasts
(who are neuer drunke) til they haue
learned this abstinence from them.
And belieue me, if you nourish drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
your families shall neuer want
woe. From which, the Lorde deliuer
you, and from Drunkards the Lorde
deliuer vs. And so I end for your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
and Hospitality, with the
Praier of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
