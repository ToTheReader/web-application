      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the course of proceeding in the
late inditement, araignement, tryall, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and execution of Edmond Campion
and others, being as well vpon sundrie of
their writings, letters and Confessions, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vpon other good and manifest proues
found guilty of high treason, was such, as ought in trueth and
reason, to satisfie all indifferent persons and well affected
subiectes, to whome her Maiesties merciful and gratious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
towards offenders, is so well knowen: yet hath it
bene found that some disloyall and vnnaturall subiects haue
vntruely spread abroad sundry rumours and reportes, and
haue published diuers slaunderous pamphlets and seditious
libels, as well in this Realme as in foraine partes, in sundry
strange languages, in excuse and iustification of the sayde
Traytours so iustly executed, with purpose to defame her
Maiesties honourable course of iustice, so much as lyeth in
them, setting out those condemned persons as men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vertue and holines, and as her highnesse true, loyal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote,
&amp; obedient subiects, and in no wise spotted with any
staine of ill disposed affection towards her Maiestie, being
not otherwise to be charged, then with certaine points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that concerneth only matters of conscience, that were
no way preiudiciall to her Maiesties state and gouernement,
with diuers like vntruthes, which are ment shall bee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
answered more at large, whereby both the malice of the
writers may bee made knowen to the worlde, and her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
most mercifull and gratious gouernement may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
from the malice of such vnnaturall and vndutiful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
In the meane time notwithstanding, the Lords and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Counsell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous that the dutifull subiectes, may bee preserued
<pb facs="3"/>
from the vndermyning of such seditious slaunderers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
otherwise they might happely by such wicked illusions
be caried into some hard conceites, touching the due and
lawfull proceeding against the sayde Traytours: haue found
it very expedient, that as well certaine confessions taken of
the said Campion and others before his arraignement, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
certaine answeres lately made to certaine articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to those that were at that same time condemned
of high treason, but yet spared from execution, should bee
published truely &amp; sincerely, in such precise forme of words,
as the same haue bene acknowledged and subscribed, not
onely with the proper hands of certaine persons of publique
calling and credite that were present at their examination
&amp; haue subscribed thereunto, but also with the proper hands
of the offenders themselues, (Hart onely excepted) as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the Originals extant to be shewed, wherby it may be
most euidently seene, euen by them selues still persisting in
their most Trayterous affection, howe vntruely the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are reported to haue bene and to bee true and faithfull
subiects in matter of her Maiesties estate and Crowne, and
howe iustly they were condemned for treason and not for
points of religion, being those, that hauing bene by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
clemencie so long spared vpon hope of repentance,
continue yet still in such Trayterous disposition of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her highnes, two of them only nowe acknowledging
their true duetie of allegiance, though in pointes of religion
not recōciled, as also one other named Edward Rishton, that
did before, openly at the barre at the time of the arraignment
(varying from Campion and the rest of his fellowes therin)
acknowledge his said duetie &amp; alleagiance to her Maiestie:
towards whom (to thend it may appeare vnto the worlde
that the said Campion &amp; the rest that were executed, were
not put to death for points that concerned matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but for treason:) Her Maiestie doth meane to extend
her grace &amp; mercie, hoping that as it hath pleased God to
frame their consciences to acknowledge towards her that
<pb facs="3"/>
duetie of allegiance that by the lawes of God and man they
owe vnto her as their most lawful prince and Soueraigne: so
hee will hereafter open their eyes to see, howe dangerously
they haue bene hitherto through false and erronious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
seduced, as well in matters concerning their dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
God, as in their alleagiance towards their Prince.
It is also looked for, that all such as make profession to bee
dutifull and well affected subiects, howsoeuer they be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in religion, seeing the most dangerous and pernicious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
that are helde and maintained by these Iesuites and
Seminary men sent into this Realme, wil hereafter as wel in
respect of the duety they owe vnto her Maiestie, as for
the care they ought to haue as good members of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
to preserue the tranquilitie thereof, as a thing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
euery mans particular duety, not onely refuse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
and harborough such disloyall persons, but also doe
their vttermost indeuour to apprehend them, and to present
them to Iustice, whereby they may receiue such condigne
punishment as is meete to bee inflicted vpon disturbers of
the publike peace in Realmes and Kingdomes.</p>
