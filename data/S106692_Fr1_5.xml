   <head>The Preface of Iacques Gohory. vnto the curteous Reader.</head>
   <p>THE affection which from my youth vpwardes (right Christian Reader) I haue borne to Musicke, aboue all other sciences, and to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> instruments of the same, was sufficient cause enough for me to haue it in high price and estimation: but the old familiaritie which it hath caused me to haue with the Aucthor of this present Booke (as Poetri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> wrought betweene <hi>Lelius,</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi>) hath prouoked me further to make this short discourse, and to direct it to you: The which shalbe aswell of the worthinesse of his person as of the cunning of his woorke, and the singularitie of the Lute, wherof the question is here. For as touching him: besides his kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ledge and dilig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> both in Musicke vsed by voyce, and also vppon instruments, all in generall are greatly beholding vnto him, for he hath reduced them into the best forme that hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> hitherto seene, wherfore by good reason, he hath deserued to be taken for prince or chiefe. Now it is a token of a person w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll borne, that his spirite hath ben alwayes so inclined to Musicke, as being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> compounded of proportion and temporatiue harmonicall: a science so perfite, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> giueth reioysing to the hart, a great part of mans felicitie, that it appeaseth the troubles and passions of the mind, yea &amp; by the report of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his politicques, that is able to reforme and establish the manners of a whole Citie. As touching the Lute, which without doubt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> holden for the most<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> noble and melodious instrument of Musicke, I will no further dilate the common prayses therof, but onely by the great singularitie of agreement and disagreement which by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> shewed in it, in this, that if one Lute be sounded neere vnto an other that is tuned in the same tune: it is a strange thing and in a manner marueilous, that the stringes of the other Lute will moue at the sound and will shake not being at all touched, by an effect of correspondence wonderfull. Which the Poet <hi>Augurall</hi> in his Chrisopeied: nor other Authors of secret Philos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ture for the Lute. The Author feareth not to be reproued by the Masters of this Art for hauing diclosed the misteries of this Science, herebefore alwayes kept hidden in their bosomes without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it to others then to such as had spent many yeares in their schooles. In which he maketh not so much conscience to prophane holy thinges, as it were to them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
