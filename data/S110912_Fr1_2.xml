Seeing therefore it pleased <hi>God</hi> so well to blesse his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Actions euen from his entrance into that Countrie til his first returne to <hi>England,</hi> that he
<pb facs="3"/>
had cleered both the <hi>Vellow</hi> and <hi>Bettowe</hi> (two rich, pleasant, and most fertile countries) of al E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, razed and defaced al their <hi>Sconces</hi> and <hi>Castles,</hi> or left thē possessed with souldiers of our own, and so greatlie enlarged the <hi>Territories &amp;</hi> contribucions of the <hi>States,</hi> besides the taking in and assuring of <hi>Deuxburgh</hi> and <hi>Deuenter:</hi> therby also diuerting or remouing the great siedge from <hi>Berke</hi> in <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> besides the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Axell</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> without the loosing of any one Towne, Sconce, or Castle, either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>māded by the English, or wherin any one English band was garry soned, til after his <hi>Excellencies</hi> departure: some priuate pikes and particular am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious grudges (grown between <hi>Stanley, Yorke</hi> and others in those prouinces,) caused these bad persons for their particular passions (in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his <hi>Excellencie)</hi> so much to forget their dueties, as traiterously to deliuer into the Enemies hands that <hi>Towne</hi> and <hi>Sconce,</hi> by <hi>Zutphen.</hi> God hauing I say so exceedinglie alwaies prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his <hi>Excellencie</hi> during his abode there, to the great honour and renowne of her <hi>Maiestie,</hi> as his most malicious Enemies had cause rather to enuie his <hi>Fortune,</hi> than backbite his <hi>Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
