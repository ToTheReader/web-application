<pb facs="3"/>
vvhich also for the antiquitie is, a boue eleuen hundreth yeere olde, and for excelencie the litle vvoorke dooth so praise it self that a far better pen thē myne adding somevvhat to the praise therof should rather blemish then beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisie it by saying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> much lesse, or much vvorse then the same dooth say for it selfe, hauing therfore (as I haue said) nothing in me to further the loue of vertue ād zeale of christianitie vvich God hath geuen you, I haue thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this olde father saint AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE to doo it for me, vvhom if it shall please your ladyship to hear vvith good affectiō attētiuely: the paine shall sure be much les thē the profit, and you shall not fail to reap great fruit vvith small trauaile, yea the labour shall soōe be gone and the profit long remaine. Novv vvhat so euer therfore in this litle treatis is spoken: I humbly beseech your ladiship allvvay to remember. It
<pb facs="4"/>
is not I: but the ancient and excellent father Saint AVGVSTINE that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. It is he that saith, reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> prayer and contemplation are the steps of that ladder that leadeth to heauen. It is he that expounding the vvoords of Christe saith, seeke by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and ye shall finde by meditation, <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> knock by praying: and it shall be opened vnto you by contemplation. It is he that saith, reading dooth as it vvere apply substāciall meat vnto the mouth, meditatiō dooth chovve it &amp; break it, <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> prater obtaineth the svveetnes of it: contemplation is the svvetnes it self. <note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> It is Saīt AVGVSTINE that saith, reading vvith out meditation is sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp; meditation vvith out reading is erronius. And lest some fond body should imagī, that this reding vvhich hee so oft speaketh of, should be the reading of any other thing but of Scripture only, and that vvith these <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>
      <pb facs="4"/>
vvords: reading (saith he) is a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the scripture vvith a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent entention of the minde, and in the tenth chapter, he saith these foure <note place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> steps are so linked togither, that they vvhich goe before vvithout them vvhich folovve: can profit litle or no thīg &amp; they vvhich folovv vvithout them that goe before: doo profit seldōe or neuer. To conclude, the vvhole somme &amp; effect therof: is nothing els but that the reading of Scripture, the meditation vpō the Scripture, prayer to obtain the vnderstanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, and contemplatiō in the svveet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods promises cōtained in the Scripture is the onely gate of Heauen, and the vvay to attain eternal life. For the cōfirmatiō vvherof: it vvere no hard matter for a man of mean knovvledge to cōpile a huge volume, and to bring many hundred places out of the auncient fathers. VVherin they
<pb facs="5"/>
plainly and directly confirm the same, that by these steps onely, &amp; none other vvay: a man must goe to heauen. But moste of all it ought to mooue vs that God him self by his ovvne vvord hath ratified this to be the only vvay to Heauen, and that for all men, vvith out any exception. For vvho can haue <note place="margin">Deut. 17. ver. 18. 19.</note> greater priuiledge then a King? or greater occasion to surceasse from the continuall excercise of this reading, meditation, prayer and cōtemplation?</p>
   <p>And is it not expresly set dovvn by Gods cōmaūdemēt, that a King ought to haue the book of Gods lavves by hī, and ought to read therin all the dayes of his life? vvho should sooner be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt frō this diligent excersise of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture then a Souldier or Captain, and <note place="margin">Jos. 1. ver. 8</note> that durīg the vvarres? But dooth not God him self speak vnto the noble Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queror &amp; captaī, Iosua in the first ētre of his vvarres, and straightly charge
<pb facs="5"/>
him saying? Let not the book of this <note place="margin">Josu. 1. ver. 8.</note> lavve departe out of thy mouth, but occupy thy minde therin day &amp; night. VVhere mark these precise tearmes, Book, mouth, minde, day, night. For vvho seeth not that vpō euery of these vvords much might be said if breuitie vvould suffer it. VVhen or at vvhat time should any intermission frō the exercise of Scripture be graunted to any man, if it be cōuenient for a noble man trauailing by the vvay in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to read the Scriptures? And did <note place="margin">Act. 8. ver. 30.</note> not the noble Lord Tresurer of the great Queene Cand ace trauailing by the vvay, sit in his Chariot treading of Esayas the Prophet? &amp; vvas not the end therof saluation of his soule?. Is it not also vvrittē by Saint Luke for <note place="margin">Act. 19. ver. 11.</note> an euerlasting commendation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that vvere the noblest of birth among them of Thessalonica, because (vvhen Paule had preached) they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="6"/>
the Scriptures, and that dayly to see vvhether it vvere so or not? And by that meanes they vvere brought vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the faith of Christe. Yea and not noble men only, but Ladies also by nāe are apoīted of God to tread these steps, and they shall neuer come to heauen other vvise then by reading the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by meditation of the scriptures, by praier to vnderstand them, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation in the svvetnes of them. And therfore Saint Iohn vvriteth <note place="margin">2. Joh. 1. ver. 1.</note> one of his epistles vnto a Lady, that Ladies also hauing the vvoord of God so especially dyrected vnto them, might endeuour thēselues vvith the greter dyligēce to read it and certēly knovv themselues not to be excluded frō the exercise therof.</p>

But lest I should passe the competent boūds of an Epistle: I vvil breefly note the Book, the Chapter and the Verse of diuers other places, vvhere God him self by his holy vvord plainly teacheth that all men, yea, men, vvomen and children, ought to be diligently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the vvord of God, as the onely vvay to eternall life and the Ladder of Heauen.</p>

   <p>The very nāe of Gods vvoord ought to strike into our harts, great reuerēce tovvard it, great desire to haue it, great haste to hear it, great loue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad it &amp; like care to keep it. If a Kīg or
<pb facs="7"/>
a Queen should vvrite vnto vs, lord hovv vvould vve shore vp our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res? vvhat haste should vve make to hear the contents? Beholde God him self hath directed his letters to euery one of vs, his ovvne spirite is his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, his Prophets and Apostles are Purciuants &amp; messengers that bring them vnto vs. Intollerable is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God that sen deth thē, if vve doo not humbly read them, hear them and diligently mark and obserue the speciall points, and contents of them. The dredful vvoords of God doo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovve such contempt, as it is vvrittē.</p>
   <p>O turn you vnto my correction, lo I vvil expresse my minde vnto you, and make you vnderstād my vvoords. Seeing then that I haue called &amp; you refused it, I haue stretched out my hād and no man regarded it, but all my counsel yee haue despised, and set my cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rections at nought: therfore shall I
<pb facs="8"/>
also laugh in your destruction &amp;c. VVhat promise can be svveeter, then to haue God expresse his minde vnto vs, and make vs vnderstand his vvoord? VVhat terror can be greater then to haue God laugh and reioice in our destruction. From vvhich dredful destruction, I beseech almighty God de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liuer vs, and stay vs vppon the steps of his holy vvord, til vve come into his happy kingdome.</p>
