      <hi>TO ALL SVCH AS PROFESSING THE FAITH AND OBEDIENCE of Christ haue separated themselues from</hi> the Churches of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING iust occasion of late to looke into your bookes, I found that there are <hi>foure causes alleadged for your Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that <hi>the principall of them all, concerneth the confusion, and mixture of good &amp; bad in our church. We forsake</hi> (say you) <hi>your Church for this maine corruption,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Counterp. 3.</note>
      <hi>that all sorts of profane and wicked men, haue beene, and are, both they and their seede receiued into, and nourished within the bosome of your Church, contrary to the first coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of our Redemption: contrarie also to the example of all Gods Churches since the world began, who alwayes were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the vngodly as the Scriptures shew.</hi> Thus speaketh M. <hi>Ainsworth:</hi> and M. <hi>Robinson</hi> after this manner.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Answ. to a Censorious Epistle 35.</note>
      <hi>In these two respects principally, your Babylonish confusion of all sorts of people in the body of your Church without separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and your Babylonish bondage vnder your spirituall Lords, the Prelates, wee account you Babylon, and flye from you.</hi> Herevnto adde that which M. <hi>Smith</hi> saith, in his Paralleles:<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note>
      <hi>All Churches or assemblies of men, whatsoeuer professing Christ, and not separated from worldlings are false Churches, and so without: onely the separated Churches are the true Churches, and are within.</hi> And in another place thus. <hi>A false worship,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Daral. 14.</note>
      <hi>ministerie, and gouernment may be in a true Church, through ignorance and the like occasions:</hi> Which thus hee amplyfieth.<note place="margin">Ibid. 15.</note>
      <hi>A true man may haue a woodden legge, an eye of glasse: so a
<pb facs="5"/> true Church may haue a false ministerie, and worship, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</hi> Hauing therefore a desire to reclaime you (if it be possible) and bring you back againe to our Churches, I thought I could bestow my paines no way more profitably, then in discouering vnto you how weake and insufficient this is to ground your Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon. And this I haue endeauoured to doe in this Treatise.</p>
   <p>I haue therein also both discouered and conuinced sundry errors of yours, and your frequent and horrible peruerting of the sacred Scriptures for the defence of them. And now I heartily pray you to consider, That the soule of man is in very great danger by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing errour, as well as by yeelding to profanenesse. That errour in the minde, doth greatly hazard the saluation of mans soule; and that it is as fearefull and dangerous a thing, to bee carried about with euery winde of doctrine, as to consent to sinners when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise vs. Hence it is that wee are not onely exhorted, that <hi>wee sholud not beleeue euery spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God;</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.1: 1. Thes 5.21.</note> that we should <hi>try all things, and keepe that</hi> onely <hi>which is good:</hi> but oft bidden to <hi>take heede that no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 24.4.5.23, 24.</note> to <hi>beware of false Christs, which if it were possible, should deceiue the very elect:</hi> and to <hi>beware of false Prophets,</hi> meaning false Teachers:<note place="margin">Mat. 7, 15.</note>
      <hi>which</hi> though they <hi>come in sheepes clothing,</hi> with a shew of truth &amp; holinesse, that they may the rather deceiue:<note place="margin">Act. 20.29.</note> yet <hi>inwardly they are rauening wolues. I know this</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) that after my departing shall grieuous wolues en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in among you, not sparing the flocke.</hi> Whereby wee learne, that as grieuous and rauening wolues doe prey vpon and destroy the carkases of the silly sheepe: so doe false Teachers the soules of men. From hence also it is, that our Lord Iesus hath as well forewarned vs to <hi>take heede and beware of false doctrine,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 16.6.12. Luke 12.15.</note> as to <hi>take heede and beware of couetousnesse.</hi> In both of these he vseth a double caueat, because both of them are very dangerous to the soule; so as we haue as great neede to beware of the one as of the other. If the Lord had onely said, Beware of false doctrine; hee had thereby intimated that there is danger in beleeuing such doctrine: but hee iterating and doubling the caueat.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.6. Marke 8.14.</note>
      <hi>Take heede and beware of false doctrine</hi> (which is also noted by two Euangelists) doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by imply the danger is very great. It is also to bee obserued that Iesus compareth false doctrine to <hi>Leauen, Take heede and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb facs="5"/> of the Leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces:</hi> teaching vs thereby, that as a little leauen sowreth the whole lumpe of dough, so a little false doctrine the whole minde. Wee neede not goe farre to confirme this by examples. Who knoweth not that many among you, from Brownisme haue fallen into Anabaptisme? Your selfe M. <hi>Iohnson</hi> doe acknowledge this in your answere to M. <hi>White:</hi> And I my selfe doe know that M. <hi>Smith</hi> and those of his Church, at the first receiued onely some few small and petty errours in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, holding still communion with vs: but after in processe of time grosser errours growing vpon them they departed and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from vs, and are now by little and little fallen into a gulfe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as plainely appeareth by sundry of M. <hi>Smiths</hi> bookes lately published, and namely <hi>the Paralleles; The differences of the Churches, of the Separation;</hi> and <hi>the Character of the beast.</hi> We may also remember, that errour in the minde, is by the Holy Ghost compared to a <hi>Gangraine</hi> or <hi>Canker:</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.17.</note> which beeing in any part of the body, stayeth not there, but by little and little spreadeth it selfe further, and pierceth into the bones, not ceasing to inlarge it selfe vntill it hath brought destruction to the body. Euen so it is with the soule, when errour inuadeth it,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.10.</note>
      <hi>Reiect him</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>that is an Hereticke, after once or twice admonition: knowing that hee that is such is peruerted, and sinneth being damned of his owne se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>fe.</hi> As if hee should say: There is little or no hope of reclaiming heretickes; such as be contentious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in their errours, but that all labour vsed to that end is in vaine and lost. Their disease is almost incurable. For say that they be conuinced, and in themselues doe condemne that which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: Yet are they vsually so peruerse and obstinate as they will continue still in their sinne, maintaining their opinion against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Yet notwithstanding saith <hi>Paul,</hi> let them be <hi>admonished once or twise,</hi> if hapily they will amend: Which if they doe not, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>admonition</hi> thus giuen, haue nothing to doe with them. And doe we not in experience see, how hard a thing it is to draw men from error, to the loue and imbracing of the truth? Be they Turkes, Papists, Anabaptists, Familists, or whosoeuer that bee wrapt in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Certainely it is as easie a matter to draw couetous men from the desire of riches, voluptuous men from the loue of pleasure; the proud man from his pride, and the drunkard from his drunkennes:
<pb facs="6"/> as to bring a man intangled in errour, to receiue and acknowledge the truth. Of the former sort of these, if they haue continued long in their sinne, the Prophet saith thus: <hi>Can the Blacke-Moore change his skin?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier. 13.23.</note>
      <hi>or the Leopard his spots? Then may ye also doe good, that are accustomed to euill.</hi> The same is no lesse true of all such who haue dwelt and abide long in their errours. Beware therefore and feare (my deare brethren and countreymen) to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still in your schisme and errours, and hearken to the counsell of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 19.27.</note>
      <hi>My sonne heare no more the instruction that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi> Goe not, I beseech you in the name of Iesus, one step more forward in the way you are in. For I call heauen and earth to record, that it leades to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And why will ye die, O ye children of men? It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God: for our God is a consuming fire.</p>
   <p>I know you perswade your selues of better things, and such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpany saluation. You think that the way you now are in, is the only way to life. But what if you mistake it? Christ telleth vs, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall seeke to enter in at the straight gate,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 13.24.</note>
      <hi>and shall not bee able.</hi> Which cannot be vnderstood of men minding earthly things, whether it be their profits, or pleasures. For they neither desire, nor seeke after any such thing. But of heretickes, Schismatickes, and sectaries. You will say (I know) that you are no schismatickes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you separate from a false Church onely, and ioyne to a true, in deede if that which you teach of the visible Church were true, then were all our congregations false Churches. But heare and marke well what I say. Such a visible Church as you require, and pretend to be, there is not in the world, neither euer was: You teach in this point that which is repugnant to the Scriptures, and a thing vnpossible in it selfe to be. Such a societie as you say a true visible Church is, is not visible, cannot possibly be seene or discerned.</p>
   <p>But some of you will say: are not our Ministers learned? Yes. That lets not but that both they may, and indeede doe grossely erre in those things wherein they dissent from vs, and from all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world. Who knoweth not that among the Papists there be many of great learning and gifts: which haue very great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and skill in the arts, in the languages, are of excellent vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, expert and ready in holy Scriptures; can speake and write
<pb facs="6"/> truely, agreeing with the Scriptures, of sundry of the secrets of the Kingdome of heauen: as of God, his nature, persons, attributes: Of Christ Iesus his incarnation, his birth, life, preachings, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, comming to iudgement, of the Resurrection, of the life to come, with many more of this kinde: and yet notwithstanding in those points wherein they differ from the Church of England, and all other true Churches: they are blinde as beetles.</p>
   <p>But you will obiect further, that what you of the Separation hold is proued plentifully out of the word of God, I acknowledge indeede that you abound and superabound in your allegations of Scripture, Neuer any men contending for lyes, did therein goe beyond you, nor equall you neither. If hereunto we adde their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall holinesse: wee may safely say, that in no faction or schisme that euer yet was in the world, Satan did more transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light then in this. But what? Their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being peruerted, as the truth is, and so tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Reader: all this is but sheepes clothing,<note place="margin">Mat 7.15.</note> whereof Christ biddeth vs to beware. Horrible and fearefull is your abusing and wresting of holy Scripture, and to some incredible. It had been well for you if you had been more sparing in your quotations: then had yee lesse taken Gods Name in vaine: who will not hold you guiltlesse for the same, except ye repent.</p>
   <p>And now dearely beloued: behold, Christ Iesus stands at the doore and knockes aloud, tarrying and abiding there, as one very desirous to come in, and loth to be kept out He that hath the keyes of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who shutteth and no man openeth: and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and no man shutteth: open the doore of your soule, that you may let Christ enter in. And to that end open I humbly beseech you the eyes of your minde, that you may bee able to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene things that differ, and know truth from falsehood: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting and abhorring the one, which is from the Diuell; may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the other, which is from God.</p>
   <p>And here my deare countrimen, who lately are gone out from vs, and become Anabaptists, I beseech you, consider of this one thing with me. When you first separated from the Church of England, did not you highly esteeme and reuerence the Church of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> euen as the deare spouse and body of Christ?<note place="margin">I meane the Brownists Church there.</note> Would not you then gladly haue had communion with them if possibly you could,
<pb facs="7"/> when you refused the same with vs? Did not then all of you assure your owne soules that that way which then and still we call <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> was the onely way to life wherevpon in that way you would needs walke, come on it what would, imprisonment or banishment; life or death? Did not then some of the chiefe of you in my hearing, magnifie M. <hi>Fr. Iohnson,</hi> and their bookes specially the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> aboue all bookes next to the holy Bible? And in all this you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced exceedingly. How commeth it now to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>asse, that so quickly, not onely our Churches, but the aforesaid Church at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> is likewise become an Harlot and Babylon? That you abhorre now as much to haue religious communion with them, as with vs? How commeth this (I say) to passe, but because that which the Apostle saith generally of all deceiuers, is and must needs be in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar true of you, your selues being deceiuers: That you <hi>wax worse and worse: deceiuing, and being</hi> more and more <hi>deceiued.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus haue I in few words, by way of commination, exhortation, dehortation, and supplication indeuoured to perswade you my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Separation, (speecially my countreymen, who are lately entred into this way,) to renounce your errours, and to breake off by repentance your grieuous sinne of <hi>separating,</hi> and all the sinnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it. If this I haue published preuaile not thus farre, (though not with all, yet with some of you) as to bring you to the sight and acknowledgement of your erronious doctrine concerning <hi>the visible Church,</hi> and your peruerting of holy Scripture for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, as my hope is it will. I for my part doe confesse that I vtterly despayre of doing any good of you: and say to you as I haue learned from the Apostle to speake in this case: <hi>If any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi> I shall also hold it vaine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any further with you.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.38. &amp; 11.16.</note>
      <hi>If any lust to be contentious,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) wee haue no such custome, nor the Churches of God:</hi> And so I end, leauing the successe hereof, both with you and others to the Lord: whom in Iesus Christ I beseech, to accept of this my poore and weake seruice, and to grant that it may prosper to that end, wherevnto by me his most vnworthy seruant it is intended: euen to the glory of his great Name, and edification of his Church, <hi>Amen.</hi>
