   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no man (right reuerend Father) but he may imagine at the first sighte, that this pretie Booke written Dialogwise, easie to be borne for the smalenes of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, soone to be ouerhandled for the fewnesse of the leaues, and very good cheape for the ouerlittlenes of the price, is vvorthy of no prayse, or else of very little. But if he searche and ransacke the bowels of it, so as he reade it not in post, or as one halfe asleepe, ne lightly giue as it vvere a glaunce at it, but consider vvell the excellencie of the matter, the orderly teaching therof, and the fitte knitting of all things together: he shall vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confesse (and that of very good
<pb facs="3"/>
right) that it chalēgeth no smal cōmē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datiō. For the case standeth not vvith this Booke, as vvith vvares, vvhich the Marchantmē are vvont to thrust vppon their Chapmen that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their vviles, by setting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine procured bewty vppon them, vvherof vvhen the tryall commeth, their Chapmen are so farre off from gaining any vvhit by them, that they do rather complaine of wrong done vnto them, and being ouertaken with losse vnlooked for, are faine to come short of the commodity vvhich they hoped after. For here the faith of a christian mā is plainly portraied out, wherof it beareth in deed the notable title in the forfront of it, not to pretēd one thing in show, &amp; another thing in deed, after the maner of flatterers, but to the intēt that the readers being allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the rarenes of the Title, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the groūd, &amp; cōsidering the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors vnaccustomed maner of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="3"/>
should become the more skilful &amp; desirous of so great &amp; so heauēly a misterie, &amp; by that mean, with liuely voice beare record that this little Boke is most worthy of their cōmēndation.</p>
   <p>I graunt that many Books do dayly come foorth (the more pittie) vvherof some, yea an infinite sum, in the parts beyond the seas, &amp; other some on this side the seas haue ben hatched out of mens teeming &amp; childbearing heads, by the midwifeship of the diuell. By the force of which Bookes, bewtified with glorious foretitles, these trim &amp; cunning discoursers, allure, or rather infect, yea &amp; vtterly kill mens soules through the presēt poisō of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions &amp; doctrins. Much like vnto cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō harlots, vvhose dayly custome &amp; ordinarie trade it is, to besmere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues outwardly vvith oyntments &amp; sweet powders, to the end they might the more tickle and stir vp, as it vvere vvith certayne prickes, their mates
<pb facs="4"/>
set all vpon loue, to the cooling of the heate of their lust, hauing no regarde in the meane vvhile, to vvash away the filth grovvne together vvithin them euen in a heape.</p>
   <p>Of this stampe are all the bookes of the Romish route, glittering vvith glorious titles, pretēding the doctrins of greatest mysterie, yea and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test importaunce also, and (to saye briefly vvhat I thinke) chalenging and behighting any thing, vvhereas besides their stately vvords, their Thrasolike speeches, their scornefull scoffes, and their other childish tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, and olde vviues tales, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine not any thing that is vvorthie to be vveied or considered, but rather to be laughed at and hissed out. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche that this saying of the Poet may vvell be applied vnto them, The mountaines labour of childe, and out there creepes a sillie mouse.</p>
   <p>To these, you among the rest of
<pb facs="4"/>
the Bishops of this renowned Realm, vvhich are in manie respectes to be reuerenced, haue bin a verie sore eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and though not at hande, yet a farre of you haue so vvounded that misshapen Monster of the vvorld, vvhich leaueth nothing vnattempted to bring all Princes in subiection to him, partlie by vexing of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers diuers vvayes, hovvbeit not vvith anie kinde of torment, as their vvilful stubbornes requireth, but by vrging them vvith vvholsome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and vveightie exhortation, to turne avvaie from their crooked pathes vvhich leade to destruction, partly in burning their bookes vvhich vvere stuffed vvith all kinde of filthie railings and reproches, and finallie in attempting all meanes to pinche in his kingdome, and to disperse and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie abolish that pestilent Seminarie of his, vvherby he goeth about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitch all the coastes of the vvorlde.
<pb facs="5"/>
That these things are so, all mē confes with one mouth, &amp; euen the Papists themselues (vnlesse they will lie most shamefully) will not deny thē. For as much therfore, right reuerēd Father, as you are greatly busied about these thinges, and (besides the time vvhich you spend in the studie of Diuinitie) the matters of greatest waight lie dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpō your back, how fitly may this saying of S. Paules be applied vnto you, vvherwith he closeth vp his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, after a long reckoning vp of his labours, saying. <hi>Besides all the other things that dayly distresse me, the care of all congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations lieth vpon me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, were there the like mind and indeuoure in the Pope, the gazing stock of the vvorld, and in the residue of the Papists, thē shuld not so many hundred thousand soules be thrust downe into Hell, neither should so great darknesse be cast vppon the true vvorship of God, nor Christs, church
<pb facs="5"/>
be so miserably and vvofully assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor Christ himselfe the liuely Image of his Father, be mangled vvith so many dartes of reproch, nor the light of the Gospell be dimmed vvith so many mists of mens ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, nor so many firebrands of dissention tost among Christian Princes, nor Common vveales be torne in peeces vvith so many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes of insurrections, nor Gods glorie be abated vvith so greate carelesnesse and negligence, nor finally, the Deuill so triumphe and reioice.</p>
   <p>But I vvill call my self back againe, and vvith as much shortnes of speech as I can, I vvill touch the things that are nerer to the matter vvich we haue in hand. I haue declared already what an old hart grudge and deadly hatred you beare to the Pope of Rome and all Papistes: Also I haue shewed, though not cūningly, yet truly, what
<pb facs="6"/>
meanes you haue vsed to call them back from their pernicious opinion, vvith how great zeale you haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to further the pure religion, and to put avvay heresies, and the sovvers abroade of heresies, by anye kinde of meane, that Christs church being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led avvay from all blinde seruing and colourable misvvorshipping of God, may loue her Christ from her heart, vvith open armes embrace him, and vnseparably stick to him alone.</p>
   <p>And yet by the vvay, I vvill let passe that cheefe and intire care of yours, vvherewith you bee often touched, namelye of preferring the bookes of learned men to light, by the reading and considering vvhereof, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoode knovveth, that so many as studie them, as becommeth them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stayed vp and inlightned vvith right reason and founde iudgement, doe gather most plentifull fruite. For these resemble not those vvhich in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

      </gap>s, doe play the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, vvho into their slubbersauces doe put liquerice, or of the choysest suger beaten into poulder, that they may vvith the lesse lothsomnesse and misliking be conuayed into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and afterwarde shead them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into all the conueiaunces of the body▪ so as the vaynes at length maye swel, the bovvels burst, and finally the vvhole man be killed.</p>
   <p>Naye, they be muche more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then the poysoners vvhiche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy but only the frame of the body: for they infect the very soule, killing it vtterly, and throvving it headlong into the tormentes of Hell, vvhiche shall neuer die nor cease. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise, the vvorkes of the right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, (be they little, or be they greate) yield such profit to the Readers, that they grovv euer better, but neuer vvoorse, euer skilfuller, holyer, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb facs="7"/>
perfecter, and acceptabler to God.</p>
   <p>The reason vvhereof hath ledde your Fatherhood so to fauour the vvritten Copie of this little Booke, vvhich treateth lightsomly of the true faith of a Christian man, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Bookes whereof the nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is infinite, vvith the superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own hand, you haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised the same to be printed, that it may go abrode and be common in the hands of all such as desire to haue the triall of their faith.</p>
   <p>The vvhich now comming forth vvith a new outward shew, if your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Fatherhoode shall vouchsafe to accept, vvith the accustomed fauor of your good countenance, and to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to rest vnder the shadow of your defense, yelding your self to be as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of it, considering that the booke is commended inough of it selfe, and
<pb facs="7"/>
the vvriter therof vvas notably lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and hath deserued very vvell of the true Religion, vvhich vve novv imbrace, or as I may vvell say, that it shall be the better vvelcome to all such as loue the Christian faith, so am I vvell assured, that it shall turne to the great benefite of many, and besides that, though I be sore hindred vvith the great vvaight almost of daylye businesse, you shall stirre me vp to take in hande the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereof into Englishe, and to make an ende of it euen oute of hand.</p>
   <p>GOD moste gratious and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye graunte you abundaunce of his heauenly grace, shead vppon you the most sweete Oyle of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
