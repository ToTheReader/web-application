      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot many yeres passyd, moste noble prynce, whā I shulde preache the pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, and holsome, worde of god, at your cytie of Lausane. I dyd {per}ceiue, by many argumentes, bothe the sobre gentylnes of youre mynde, and also the outragyous wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, of certayne flaterers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers. For at altymes, where as you were present, at my sermons, you dyd moste purely fauer the worde of god, and whan you were constreynyd, with vrgent busynes, to be absent (whiche was ones, and eftsones) as you haue enformyd me, very many were aboute sumwhat busyly, to alyenat, or make
<pb facs="7"/>
you straunge, ye as it were to say, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiously to drawe you frome the worde of god. lyke fyrye burnyng knyghtes, adfyrmyng that I preachyd heresye. But at the laste the myghty verytye, hathe so conuycte you, that you haue wryten many thynges for me, and I gladly cōfesse, that for the loue of you I was gentylly enterteynyd, with the Bernēses, Ligurynes, Basylyanes, &amp; Friburgyanes. Farthermore, at my de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>partyng from you, you instantly desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryd me, very ofte to wryte to you, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che to do I gladly promysed, in tyme conuenient. wherfore I beseche your hyghnes of pardone, bycause I haue nat performyd it to thys daye, for it chansyd nother by obliuiousnes, or ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glygence, but very ofte, whan I was about to do it, I was constreynydly rapte, to other maters. The laste of al I wolde haue made answere, to the hundreth paradoxes, or questyones, of <hi>CONRADVS TREGARIVS</hi> the Augustyne freresēt to you. wherin he is very busy, not alonly to pull you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way frome Christe, but also the noble gentyles of Heluetia. although he do
<pb facs="7"/>
glory, with pretens and zele of the spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite of Christ, in the spirite of erroure and blyndnes. Veryly he dothe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che nothyng lesse then Christ. For he laboryth very sore, to vndermyne the vyneyarde of the lorde of companies. that is to saye, the congregacyon or churche of christen people, euyn lyke to a crafty or wyly foxe. but this foxe, muste be taken, I saye thys lytle foxe, ye the whiche is without effycacytie, or strengthe of the spirite, that other he maye be sauyd, or els confoundyd put downe. accordynge as the spouse commaundyth in the cantykles, saing take to vs these foxes, these lytle fox{is}, that vndermyne the vyneyardes and the lytle eyes of the vynes. which wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, howe they shulde be vnderstādyd I haue declaryd, in my enarracyon in to the cantycles. Farthermore whā I was about, an answere, in to the sayde paradoxes, or conclusyons, the derely belouyd, and trewe teachyd bretheren of god <hi>VVLSGANGVS FABRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIVS</hi> Capito, and <hi>MARTINE BVCER,</hi> two of the byshopes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentyne, preuentyd me. And for that
<pb facs="8"/>
cause I dyd leaue of my purpose and toke on hande, the reiteracyon or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng forthe the comentaryes (whiche I had begonne) in to certayne of the prophetes, with many other thynges. for I knowe them to furnyshe that mater, more dylygently then shal nede that any man shulde adde any thynge to theyr wryting{is}. I wolde but alonly monishe you, to beware, and take hede of suche wolues, goyng in shepes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, that they do nat in euery place vyolently rapte, slee, and dystroye. I haue also made answere, to the epystle that he dyd wryte to you in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng of his boke. deferrynge to wryte to you matters, of greater grauytye, vnto a tyme more conuenient, as well as if I had made answere to the sayde paradoxes, or conclusyones. Nor you shall nat merueyle that I sayde, there be many byshopes of one cytye, for ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely euery cytie, hath so many byshop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes, as it hathe true euangelystes or preachers, for euery preacher, of the truthe, I say of the truthe, that dothe nat preachelyes, decrees, inuencions, dreames, lawes, and coūselles, of men,
<pb facs="8"/>
but the moste pure and symple worde of god, is a true byshope, although he be nat callyd so of many the churche of god, hathe no other byshopes, but these. therfore there as is no pure mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the worde of god, is no bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and without doute, we haue ben very longe and manye yeres without byshopes, in the moste fearfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of god, for they that haue be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyd byshopes, to this day, be nothyng lesse than byshopes, excepte they wyll be callyd wycked, or purse byshopes, or byshopes of the kyngdome of anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>christe. Verely a byshope is callyd by interpretacyō an ouersear or watcher, and euery man is byshope of the thīg that he moste entendythe. But there is no man so blynde, but he perceuyth to what thyng{is} these byshopes of the kyngdome of perdycyon entende. Ye and they glory them selues, in lyenge wordes sayeng. He that dothe a thīg, by another / aperethe to do it by hym selfe. This rule / is execrable / and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syd byfore the lorde, in those thynges that pertaine to the office of a byshop whose hyest pointe is ministery of the
<pb facs="9"/>
alonly worde of god, for they may cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte to other the ministery of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, bycause they be pryncypally sent to the ministery of the worde. As saynte Paule wryteth of hym selfe, in the fyrste epystle to the Corinthianes the fyrste chapitre, sayeng Christ sent nat me to baptyze but to preache the gospell more ouer these buggyshe bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes, substitute or haue none vnder thē, that is a pure euangelyst, but hyre wretches, and moste couytouse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes of lukre, that seke nothynge lesse then the glory of god, and helthe of soules. I shall brefly intreate vpon with your hyghnes, of those thynges that I copiously wrytte vpon, to the moste noble lorde <hi>IOHAN</hi> Cardinal (as they call it) of Lotherynge. what the Pope, with hys Cardynalles, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebyshopes, Byshopes, Abbottes, Chanones, &amp; all other benefised men, shall do, leste they peryshe, but may be sauyd. For of truthe / all theyr hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is of the dyuell. Let them beware therfore / that they be nat euerlastīgly confoundyd / and peryshe. For bysho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes be alonly {pro}phetes of truthe / and
<pb facs="9"/>
there shulde be so many byshopes, as the multytude of people requyreth. Ye and to confesse the truthe, I can nat call your hyghnes, a byshope excepte I shulde flatre, and do agaynst my con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scyence, whiche is to be auoydyd of the faythfull, euyn as the venyme of the serpent Aspis. I cōfesse you to be a prynce, I knowe nat you to be a bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, bycause you preache nat the gospell. But it is nat in euery man, to preache the gospel, but of thē to whō it is gyuen of the lorde, for they muste be sende to it, of him. And these be the true byshopes, of the churche of god. Therfore dylygently endeuour, your selfe that tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes may nat be lordes, but alonlye doctours, or teachers, and seruauntes of the people of god. It is iniury to a prynce, to be callyd byshope, ye and vtterly the moste greuous mockage, if the thynge spoken, be delygently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynyd, wolde nat be thynke hym selfe deludyd, that were callyd by a name nothyng <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">

is it than to say, beholde a preacher of the worde of god, contynually prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the gospell, hauyng knowledge of holy scripture, teachīg the people, with the alonly &amp; pure worde of god, attrybutynge to god hys due honour and prayse, herberous, or kepyng hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalytie, geuyng example of him selfe to other to folowe the gospell in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, moste dylygent in redynge and expounding the scriptures, and yet he hathe none of all these. I wyll suffre euery man to call you a byshop, which I wyll nat do my selfe leste I be iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryous to you. I well knowe that you be prynce of Lausane, ye and I wolde that you shulde so playe the prynce, that you wolde dylygently laboure to haue many true byshopes vnder you. For verely euery paryshe ought to haue hys propre byshope, the whiche shulde be chosen of the people, and cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyrmed by the cominaltie of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of euery place, and to do this thīg they haue no nede of letters, rynges, sealles, tokēs, and suche other of this kynde very muche vsyd clene cōtrary to the worde of god. So longe they
<pb facs="10"/>
shulde be accountyd for byshopes as they preache moste purely the gospell of the kyngdome of god. Frō the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if they swarue one iote, and teache straunge doctryne, they ought to be deposyd, and put out, of them by whō they were electe and chosen, that is to say of the comynaltie of the churche afore namyd, and other more apte to be electe. But of thys matter I haue spoken more at the large in an other place. Therfore I wyll returne to our purpose of Tregarius. He dyd wryte to your hyghnes supposyng you to be Fabiane, where as you be Sebastiane as the letters beare wytnes, gyuen to me by your owne handes, wherin he goyth aboute, to supprese and treade vnder fote the eternall veritie of god, vnder the name (as he hathe wrytten) of Lutherane secte, and vnder colour of zele towarde the church, he rayleth the moste lycētiously in to the truthe, and that same churche, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ho is he (at the leaste) that {per}ceiueth the thyng{is} of god, that folowith Luther, or sayeth I am of Luthers secte? Luther is a man, and therfore of hym selfe a lyer,
<pb facs="11"/>
but if Luther, or any other speake the veritie, and truthe of god, what is the cause that we do nat gyue place to the truthe, whiche the holy ghoste dothe make open to vs, by Luther? For I praye you is it nat wrytten of suche men: you be nat they that speake, but the spirite of your father that spekith in you? it is nothyng sauery, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sythe nat at all, that some men do say, and talke of the wysdome of god, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is founde in Paules epistles. they call it Paules philophie. I do gyue place, and beleue the wrytynges of Paule, Petre, Iohā, Esaie, Hieremie, and other prophetes of god, nat for them, but for the spirite of god, which dyd speake in them. Luther hathe nat teachyd me, nother hys wrytynges, those thing{is} the which I haue knowē by the gyfte of god, in holy scriptures Yet for all that I cōfesse, me to knowe Luther, ye and nat a lytle to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fytyd thorugh hys company. I know him to be the apostle, and aungell of god, that is to say sent of hym. For it is inpossible that he shulde be sent, but of him, to haue wrytten those thynges
<pb facs="11"/>
that he hathe wryttē, that is, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures of truthe, and euyn as it is nat to be condempnyd that Paule hathe wrytten bycause he was a man, in lyke case, nother Luthers wrytynges are to be cōdempnid bycause he is a man. For it is nat Luther, but god y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hathe wrytten and spoken in Luther. But th{is} Tregarius, to obtayne the fauour of Antichriste, vnder the name of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dothe openly speake agaynste Christe and his viritie. He dothe also vnder that name resyste the impollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyd scriptures of god, all the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and his louers, and callythe them defenders of sectes, causing great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, repletynge the worlde with all vnquietnes, Philistianes hauīg vaine and folyshe armoure, mockers / and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyuers / &amp; of this maner dothe rayle agaynste them with the moste oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious crimes.

But nowe loke vpon the craftynes of this foxe, {per}auenture he is afrayde / leaste that he shulde be put out and exilyd of antychrist / from the tyrānycall prouincialshype of his secte / &amp; for that cause / he so feruently defēdyth his parte / settyng at nought the worde of the lorde. Nowe if he take this for a secte / to loue and teach the moste pure worde of god (the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we doubte nat of) we do couit, and halfe this holy / necessary, eternal, and inuincible secte / and byfore hym and suche lyke / we wyll be of this secte / &amp; cleaue to it must surely / orels without remedy we shulde peryshe {per}petually. we be adherētes and defēders of thys eternall / heuenly / and deuyne secte / &amp; it is necessary / that we be tumultuous or bryngers vp of rumoures for it / a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the execrable / cursid / and abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mynable secte of antichriste.
