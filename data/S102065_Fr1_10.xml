Downe at thy Brest; unty those Armes, that strung</l>
      <l>Thee like a Booke; Bid <hi>Farewell</hi> now to Teares,</l>
      <l>Palenes, &amp; Hollow eyes; to Groves, Dreames, Feares,</l>
      <l>And Ʋerses, which as lamentably run</l>
      <l>As the last Fountaine that thou sat'st upon.</l>
      <l>Thou shall not still live an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Nor vainly Jdoll thy Idolatry.</l>
      <l>Leaveing thy lowder Blasphemy, you'le see</l>
      <l>There's no such Divell, as thy Deitie.</l>
      <l>Thy Soule's come Home againe; Thy Cheeks fresh Rose</l>
      <l>May now be smelt, by a cleane Ʋpright Nose.</l>
      <l>Those Flouds, &amp; Ebbs of Thoughts, which rag'd by fits,</l>
      <l>Are now as hushd, as when the Halcyon sits.</l>
      <l>This Book will dresse thee too; wee shall not say,</l>
      <l>Thou look'st like one going to Bed all day.</l>
      <l>Nor shall the French disease (strange Heraldry!)</l>
      <l>Blaze, as an embleme of Gentility.</l>
      <l>You need not now seeke sadder Remedies,</l>
      <l>From a quick poyson, or a Precipice.</l>
      <l>There needs no <hi>Falling Out,</hi> like those that cry,</l>
      <l>Discords in Soules too make up Harmony.</l>
      <l>Love, as 'tis borne, is Heal'd too by a <hi>Looke:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Read but this plainer Print, you're <hi>sav'd by th' Book.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Cupid</hi> is now turn'd <hi>Man;</hi> and is all eyes;</l>
      <l>Tis only hard to <hi>Love, and not be Wise.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Js Love a subtle Labyrinth? Here you</l>
      <l>Have every Line a sure directing clue.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="18"/>
Though Woemens Beauty Tanns the soule within,</l>
      <l>As the Sunns brighter Rayes doe black the skin.</l>
      <l>Wearing this maske, you may securely see</l>
      <l>A flaming eye, and yet not scorched be.</l>
      <l>Passions, like <hi>Adams Beasts,</hi> shall fly in feare,</l>
      <l>And Reason turne, when Nakednesse is neare.</l>
      <l>The tempting Brests, now bare without offence,</l>
      <l>Raise Meditations, not Concupiscence.</l>
      <l>They humble, not inflame; when they appeare,</l>
      <l>Well thinke of nothing but our nursing there.</l>
      <l>All motion's zeale, Rapture and Extasy;</l>
      <l>And every kisse, and act of Charity.</l>
      <l>Our Bedds are Altars now, where refind Hearts</l>
      <l>Mixe as the only common, naked Parts.</l>
      <l>We love a Mistresse as a Friend, and greet</l>
      <l>Strangers as Chast as when our own lipps meet.</l>
      <l>No talke of Hornes i'th Citty: The Court Page</l>
      <l>Shall not againe take nightly Pilgrimage.</l>
      <l>Nor will a tender <hi>Lucrece</hi> feare a Rape;</l>
      <l>To meet in private now, will be to scape.</l>
      <l>This Treatise makes all Honest; we shall have</l>
      <l>No Infants find their Mothers wombe their Grave</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus Health alone is not recoverd; we</l>
      <l>Owe to this Booke, Vertue, and Piety.</l>
      <l>Sicknesse doth often make us good; but then</l>
      <l>When we are well we fall to vice agen.</l>
      <l>But these Divine Ingredients worke so sure,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="18"/>
That they, like Grace, Preserve, as well as Cure.</l>
      <l>Wee may as soone recall the Dead from Dust,</l>
      <l>And catch past Houres, as a relapse of Lust.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Is there <hi>a new Disease?</hi> and does no man</l>
      <l>Know what to call't? 'Tis <hi>the Physitian.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>J meane those Empericks, who out of shame</l>
      <l>Conceale it, or, 'cause 'tis an easy Name.</l>
      <l>Aegyptians like th' have Hearbs their Gods; they read</l>
      <l>(If it be English'd) <hi>Galen,</hi> as their Creed.</l>
      <l>And Cure, (as Trees embrace by sympathy;)</l>
      <l>By chance not Art, they cannot tell you why.</l>
      <l>But least this precious Antidote should erre,</l>
      <l>A Synod of Physitians here Conferre.</l>
      <l>So many drammes of Reason make this Bill,</l>
      <l>That it doth surer save, then Poysons kill.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And least severer Druggs should fright, (as some</l>
      <l>Will refuse Health, unlesse it neatly come.)</l>
      <l>Poetry candies the Philosophy,</l>
      <l>Like <hi>Galen</hi> mixt with <hi>Sydnies</hi> Arcadye.</l>
      <l>Which (like two Starres conjoyn'd) are so well laid,</l>
      <l>That it will please Stoicke, and Chambermaid.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This, <hi>(Doctor)</hi> doe I consecrate to Thee;</l>
      <l>'Tis though in broken mony, a kind Fee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But hearke; some cry, the Stationer's mistooke,</l>
      <l>And plac'd within the Cover of this Booke.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="19"/>
         <hi>Critique;</hi> I hope these Pills may worke with Thee;</l>
      <l>Then this wast paper may be Courtesy.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>My Suburbe-Wit will doe no wrong; the Sun,</l>
      <l>When 'tis eclips'd, is then most look'd upon.</l>
      <l>Faire Buildings have rude Antiques, and the Poore,</l>
      <l>Where a full Table's kept, lye at the Doore.</l>
