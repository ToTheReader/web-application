   <p>IT was trulye and wiselie saied of the poete, that one witnes, whiche hathe seen the thinge with his eyes, is more to be set bye, then tene of reporte. For in dede in thinges y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> be subiect to senses, as euerie sēse hathe certeine of thē peculiar to him, and by some bye meanes cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with other: so eche of them, in things properly apperteyning to them, performe their functions more suerly. As most certeynlye iudgeth the smel of odors, the eye of colors, and the eare of voices, thogh the eare also can iudge of colors by relation of others, and the eye can perceaue the differēce
<pb facs="3"/>
of voices set out in geometrycall proportions, or of musicians by wryting expressed. For clearer is the water at the springe, then far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of in the ryuer. but wherunto serueth this: Herunto gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We see in these owre dayes, in which, after longe and horrible darknes of gods true knowledge, which lighteneth euerye mā that commeth in to the worlde, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyke to haue chaunced amonge vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the worldlyngs and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of god, whiche, because they were not of the world, could not be fauored in the worlde, as dyd happen among y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Israelites, when so euer god of his infinite mercye raised vnto them any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, good prince or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motor of hys glory. For as then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worlde lacked not that spoured forward on ther syde, bothe emōg the commons thorow simplicitie
<pb facs="3"/>
and of the learned sorte by malice blinded: so led god in his aray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the worlde learned for lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned and simple againste y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> simple man. For by Christ they sayed, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the ruder sorte folowed him and not the princes and learned: and yet we knowe that Nicodeme, a price of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pharisies, resorted to hī, and Gamaliel doctor of the lawe and Pauls schoole master, drewe some what nye to him, &amp; Ioseph, the Centurion and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Eunuche of Candia cloue to him, and wer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one of them, for their talētes, setters oute of that fayth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was preached in his name. But in them we perceaue this difference, as in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> seruaūtes of god at these days, that amonge those, that embrace the trueth, some only knowe that theyr enemyes part is false, some know y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trueth, but not so through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that thei se the foundation and
<pb facs="4"/>
groūd thereof, which is graūted yet vnto sōe other. Wherfore, me semeth they maye not vnaptly be called, the fyrst two hearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, thother seinge. For as they are seuerall giftes, to perceaue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> error, to holde the truthe, and to knowe yt: so maie the one be with owte the other, as other distincte gyfts of god be. But to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, where as the indeuors of them all, tending to the instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, are thankfully to be accepted, and the spirite to be extincted in none: so what y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort doeth to the same end di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, me semeth yt is worthye not to cōme owte to the hādes of manie, but with some special note vnto the reader, to make hym for his farther commoditie the more attent in reding it. For though the saylable wyne nede no yue bough, because it wil in tyme gett chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="4"/>
and well abyde theyre slowe commynge: so yet, seynge the late knowinge of the spiritual workes hinder most the reader, and not it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe, as abydinge still good in yt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe, where as contrary wyse the seller and not the byer is hurt in euil wine thorow lacke of the yue bough, me thinketh this prouerbe shold nothing feare me frō cōmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding this boke vnto the, except y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>, wheras y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> only cause why I print it is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> increase of thy godly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I cold in the same mynd be lothe of thy most profyte. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I hope thou knowest the doctrine, wher of it is intyteled, to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chefe pointe and in maner the whole some of oure relygion, vtterly ransacking the kingdōe of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> deuil: So, yf I can iudge any thing therin, yt is handled in such exacte sorte, as to do the lyke fewe men wolde, and fewer colde. So
<pb facs="5"/>
that me semeth, yt maye worthely be sayed: diuers lerned men haue hetherto, to oure greate comfort, shot at this mark, and some came nye y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wight, but this hath hit the pricke. I meane for clear vtteryng of the matter to our more perfite vnder standing, and to the plaine and brefe dissoluing, which both are geuen but vnto few, of al such scruples, as well that rise to the symple Christian in wayeng this doctrine, as also that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by the malycious sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and craft of the truthes subtil enemyes inuented and forged: &amp; to be short he hath done the whol so distinctlie, referringe al things to their peculier places, by theyr difference playnely separated: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in him, if in any man againe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that rare vertue, of which the wise man Socrates, as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne scholer plato sheweth, set
<pb facs="5"/>
such store, that when he met with such an one, he wold make of him as of halfe a god. I meane to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct thinges, which gifte he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayed was the principal waye to come in questyons to the fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding oute of truth. In which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu this autor not only passeth the olde wryters, touching this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which wrotte not so clearly, as oure age of certeine articles, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause they were not so sore darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a lytle before oure tyme, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shold so much nede to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure in them: but also surmoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the most part, that hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly wrytten at this dayes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so that I maye in maner saye of him and them, as a learned man sayed in comparing the two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy philosophers, Plato and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotel, together: that is to wit, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the one set forth of his profoūd knoweledge but lytle in manye
<pb facs="6"/>
elegant wordes, &amp; the other much in fewe. Wherfore gentyl reader, if thou woldest gladly knowe the booke for the doctrynes sake, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy diligēce in reading yt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentli, playeng as the good iudge wolde in matters criminall: who if he gaue halfe an eare to an eare witnes, would geue the whole to an eye witnes. For as thou coldst not but profyte much thereby, yf yt were but a meane woorke: so must thou much more profit yt beinge as it is: seyng a thing ons well don is twise done.</p>
