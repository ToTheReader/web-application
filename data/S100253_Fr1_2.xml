      <hi>To all the LORDS</hi> Captaines and Souldiers, <hi>W. I.</hi> wisheth courage and victorie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood friends, my purpose in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these few leaues, is, to rub vp the memory of those many good Treatises, already extant, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Temptations and the Christian Warfare,
<note place="margin">M. <hi>Taylor,</hi> M. <hi>Downam, &amp;c.</hi>
      </note> and to bring them into vse. Pitie it is to see,
<pb facs="3"/>how so many and so good helps are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neglected; and people for most part liue, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of spirituall enemies, neither in the Ministerie, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Certainly it is one maine stratageme of our aduersary, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: <hi>perswading,</hi> either that there are no such blacke fiends to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or that they haue no power to tempt or corrupt them, through the goodnesse of their hearts, and the strength of their faith: <hi>and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>them to busie themselues about other matters, worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, lusts, vanities, and the treacherie of pretended friends, true enemies. While they run at large in these things, they shall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him, and his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining. Whereto if we adde the sensualitie of carnall men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who <hi>cannot</hi> looke vp to things aboue sense, and <hi>will not</hi> when they are called on, wee haue (I thinke) the full cause of this vniuersall securitie.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>One of these rocks is commonly run vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The most thinke not on it, whether there be any deuill or no. Many espie a deuill, but rather in others than themselues: And after the sin is committed, not before: And it must be a foule, grosse, open sinne too, or else it goeth without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is of opinion, that bare spetting at the mention of the deuill, and defying of him, is sufficient: And so I haue marked in the
<pb facs="4"/>very treating of these things publikely. This is an vnreproueable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and must not be called into question. And in other places, where this is laughed at for great simplenes (as indeed it is) yet through carelesnesse, or worldlinesse, or volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes, or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, the deuill keepes vp his strong holds, and suffers in no manner as hee should. The story of these wars is all they affect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. Yea Gods owne people doe not acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">

      <pb facs="5"/>themselus so generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they ought, in this cōbat; but, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer euills, take great foiles, and hinder their progresse in grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. And some of them who resist the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill well and carefully in respect of <hi>sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the exercises thereof, yet in respect of <hi>consolation</hi> and those blessed priuileges which their heauenly Father allowes them in Christ, doe not resist him, but passe their daies vncō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably. But these are more to be pitied, than
<pb facs="5"/>blamed: Yet withall must bead monished, to resist in this kinde as well as the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the deuils malice is seene in this, as in that, and God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed victory, as well as enioyned resistance.</p>
   <p>If I may (as a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter) stir vp the Lords Campe to consider bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of these enemies, I haue my desire. For mē of the former sort is the former voice of this Trumpet, in the <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> For those of the latter sort, the latter voice, in the <hi>Cōsolation.</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>Take both together, &amp; you shall acquit your selues like men, like men of God.</p>
   <p>Lately I endeuoured by a small watchword to arme Gods people against the malignity of the world,
<note place="margin">S. <hi>Matthewes contiersion.</hi>
      </note> which at the worst, can but put vs to the losse of all <hi>worldly</hi> comforts, and must still leaue vnto vs God, and Christ, and our great Comforter, &amp; our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; integrity of our consciences, &amp; the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heauen. And now I attempt the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Arch-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>the god of the world,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> the prince of darknes. He hath many waies to assaile vs, and we haue many weapons to repel him, with promise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and victory, and a crowne of triumph. There is no one thing that can discourage vs, if we be not wanting to our selues, in watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in conscionable vse of the meanes, and holy endeuours. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs vp and bee doing, and our God will goe out with vs, to assist vs, and foile our enemies.</p>

   <p>The Lord of hosts who hath ordained these conflicts, &amp; hath said to his Prophets &amp; their successors,
<note place="margin">Esa. 58.1</note>
      <hi>Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, lift vp thy voice like a Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>Set

      <note place="margin">Hos. 8.1.</note> vouchsafe a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to these my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and giue his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a heart to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, that, while we keepe out <hi>carnall</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, we admit not <hi>spirituall,</hi> and lose not our soules by security while wee preserue our bodies and outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states by magnanimity. What will it prosit a man to win the whole world, and lose his owne sowle? So I rest, thirsting for a good is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of all these trialls and skirmishes, to you
