you, partly knowing how welcome holy subiects are vnto your soule, and especially considering your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for a written Copie of the same.</p>
   <p>It is not fit that holy things bee giuen to dogges, nor pearles be cast to swine: but matters diuine, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons denoute most meete for present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both for godly vse, and strong defence against disgracers of them.</p>
   <p>J haue therefore made this Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler your Prisoner, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to your safe watch and warde: looke what paines you take, and time expend about him, <hi>the Preacher of deliuerance to all Captiues, Luke 4. 18.</hi> will one day most faithfully and richly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

I pray haue an eye alwayes vnto him, see him sicke, see him sound, see him condemned, see him saued, see his passage through Hell to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Let his example be your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, his feare your humbling, his faith your happying: you must bee touchd with Legall attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or else no taste of heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
   <p>Let not his Hell despaire you, nor his Heauen presume you: but by the one, hold awe of God and feare, and by the other, hope of happinesse for euer.</p>
   <p>Now the Lord adde vnto your glory by these and other holy helps and meanes, and his best blessings bee multiplyed vpon you, your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, louing, and religious Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

and all your tender Oliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, for his deare Christs sake.</p>
