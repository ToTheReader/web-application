   <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE gentle reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the printing of this epistle last rehearsed, I haue heard that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof vvas one Maister Briāt, vvho latelie suffered (as is sayd) vvith Maister Campian, and Maister Shervvyn, three moste blessed and fortunate men: vvhose happ hathe bene after so many torments and tortures suffred for gods cause, to seale vvith their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, the truthe, vvhiche they taught vvith so much payn and daungers before. Novv Maister briāt hathe more than his desire, being ioyned ī societie vvith Iesus hym selfe, to vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se holie name he so muche coueted to dedicate his lyfe in this vvorlde, as appeareth by this his epistle. And I dovvbt not, but that it vvas a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort vnto hym to suffer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of good father Campian, so rare a man of that Societie, vvhereof he desired so greatlie to be a member vvhiles he liued.</p>
   <p>Hovv farr all treason, and other disorder of lyfe, vvas from the harts, hands, and vvoords of these Innocent men, and the rest vvhich vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re condemned vvith them, all they can testifye vvhiche euer knevv them, or liued vvith them: for that their vvoords and exhortations, vvere allvvays to the cōtrarye, in detestation of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and in commendation of vertuouse lyfe, vvith contempt of the vvorld, and humbly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring all troubles and persecutions for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste his sake, adding alvvayes, that Catholiques must rather loue, &amp; hartilie praye for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
<pb facs="91"/>
than seeke any vvay to hurt them, or to reuenge theire selues vpon them, if it lay in their povver. This haue I hearde, and so haue thovvsands moo in Englād besydes me, and no mā liuinge (I knovv) dyd euer heare from their movvthes the contrarie. Their lyues allso vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re suche in all secret austeritie of discipline to them selues: as he that had knovvne thē, vvolde litle beleeue, that they vvere men to attempt suche matters, as they vvere charged vvithall.</p>
   <p>Yf these men had bene guiltie of suche horrible treasons: they should neuer haue bene so dallied vvithe all, first in disputatiōs, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che lesse should they haue had lyfe, libertie, and fauour offred them, for onelie yeelding to goe to churche, as maister Campian opēlie affirmed that they often had, and amongest many, named one of some accompt there present (as it vvas crediblie told me) vvhich had offered the same to hym vvith terrible threates, not onelie of deathe, but allso of renting of his nayles from his fyngars vvith pynnes, yf he yeelded not thervnto.</p>
   <p>Again, their ioyfull acceptation of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thankes geuing to God for the same, vvith their seuerall and moste vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, there made at the barre, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, doeth declare sufficientlie the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arenesse of their cōsciēces. For then, and there, Maister Campian protested before God and his angells, heauen and earthe, the vvorld and that Iudgement Seate there present, vvhiche (as he trulie sayde) vvas but a litle figure of the moste dredefull Iudgemēt seat of God, before vvhich
<pb facs="92"/>
he to his greate ioye expected shortlie to be presented: he protested (I say vpon eternall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Soule, that he vvas moste innocēt, guiltlesse, and vnvvitting of all and singular the matters in that inditement alleiged, and of euerie part and parcell thereof. Maister Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvyn protested vvith like vehemencie, that yf euer his heade did imagin, or his hart cōceiued, or his tongue vttered, or his hand attēpted, any thing against his soueraigne ladie Quene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, or against any of her honorable Councell, or against the common vvealthe, or realme of England: he renounced there his portion in heauen, and desired God, as a iust Iudge to dāne hym bothe in bodie and sovvle to the eternall darknesse and torments of hell fire And vvhen he had done, he cried oute: O happie and blessed day that euer he vvas borne. The like dyd the rest, vvhich vvere condemned vvith hym, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing openlie their false accusars there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and prayeing to God for them.</p>
   <p>Novv lett anie man shevv to me, that euer traitour dyed so, or that a guiltie conscience, dothe yelde suche cōfidence, vvhen they knevv novv that there vvas no vvaye vvith them but deathe.</p>
   <p>VVell, God be blessed for them: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his holye name hathe bene greatlie glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by them.</p>
   <p>VVhat straunge torments and other extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myties they haue suffred before they came to die, he alone knovveth, and vve heare onlie of some part thereof, for vve see they vvere not men to complain of euery thing done to them,
<pb facs="92"/>
but vvere content to put it vp in secret, vvith hope to receiue theire revvarde at his hand.</p>
   <p>Yet yf vve had not heard of their seuerall &amp; often rackings: maister Campian his cōming to the barre vvith his handes folden in lynnen clothe, and vvith that feblenesse, as he vvas neyther able to pluck of his ovvne mytton of freése nor lyft a cupp of drink to his mouthe vvithoute helpe, may vvell shevv hovv he had bene handled. Oure sorde shevv his tourmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours more mercie at the day of his Iudgement, than they haue shevved hym. Hovv mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re had bene able to beare ovvte so great rigour &amp; extremities, as they haue passed, (except Gods holie grace had bene plētifull vnto them) I doe not see. And that oure lorde dyd concurr vvith extraordinarie comfort, in their torments, it may appeare in this epistle goinge before of Maister Briant: vvhom Maister Norton the Rackem aister (yf he be not misreported) vaunted in the court to haue pulled one good foote longer than euer God made hym and yet in the myddes of all he semed to care nothing, and therfore ovvte of dovvbt (sayth he) he had a deuill vvithein hym. But vvhether it be a more propertie to the deuill to suffer patiently, or to torment other men mercyleslie, maister Briant and maister Norton shall dispute the matter one day, vvhen deuills shall be at hand to beare vvitnesse, and the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge bothe of deuills and deuelish men, shall be at hand to geue sentence. In the meane space I beseche God to accept the Innocent bloode of his vertuouse preests, for some part of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb facs="93"/>
of his vvrathe tovvards vs, and tovvards oure persecutors, that they hauing the miste of errour taken from their eyes, may see the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of Christs Catholique religion, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing vvhere of, they afflict vs so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie as he seeth, to vvhose eyes al iniuries do lye open, and to vvhose onelye Iudgement, vve leaue oure cause and doeings to be tryed and discerned, vvhen it shall seme moste conuenient to his diuine maiestie. Amen.</p>
