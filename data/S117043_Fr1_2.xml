   <head>¶ TO THE INDIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YTHENCE THE IMPRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my last litle booke (Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Reder) I heare, and I am creadiblye enfourmed, of the grudging stomackes, and of the yuell wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mindes of a numbre towardes me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me? na, towardes God, towardes their soueraigne towardes their countrey. Well: It is not <hi>Cerberus</hi> his thre folde bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yt is not hell, yt is not <hi>Pluto</hi> that can dryue me frō the standarde of Christ. But what is the cause, that I am thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended? forsooth, because I will holde no lengre with pryde, because I renounce superstition, because I set furthe the truth, and doe knowelaige the very Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Alas, what doe men meane? shall Dreames preuayle? shall vntruthes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? shall self will haue the vpper hande? shall blindenes still triumphe? shall ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie haue the victorie? as sure as God ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, sonde fryars fables be at an ende, Priestes deceaptefull deuyses are knowen, the proude murmuring of Munkes be well vnderstanded, and the abuses that haue bene, can neuer be in force agayne. Oh,
<pb facs="3"/>howe doe men, and howe many doe vtter their malice, their spight, theire enuie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst me? Yea, hauing no matter (God I thanke for it) to reprehēde in my trade of lyfe: what saye they? he is a turne coate, he is madde. what? as Festus did, will these men doe? will they say? <hi>Insanis Paule,</hi> thou arte madde Paule. &amp; is this all the shifte they haue? when my Lorde Bushop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusburie was wryting of his booke, what toye thinke youe had they deuised against him? forsoothe, they thought it good to brute abrode, &amp; that by no meane head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, howe throughe studie he was becōme madde: but thankes be vnto God, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is knowen, to bee so farre from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as they are from modestie, so farre from one iote of rashenes, as they are from reason, and right vnderstanding. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue they deuised nowe the lyke tearme also agaynst me? God amende them, and God graunte that some maye haue indifferent eyes, to see that I wryte the truethe, and that with sobrietie. And touching myne aduersaries, God geue them hartes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande where they were broughte vp, what countrey men they bee, and whence it is that they haue their succour, their
<pb facs="3"/>reliefe, and liuinges. They knowe what I meane, and they are not ignorante what I doe knowe. But for my parte I meane to hurte nonne, if I can doe vnto any of them good, I will. yet let them vse huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, let them not bee to spightefull, let them not belye mee. Wel, I haue for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne instruction (Indifferent Reader) here set furthe these fewe leafes, wherein I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue briefelye declared the meaning of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Scripture, and also haue adioyned therevnto the autorites of auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that touching the righte vse, and vnderstanding of the Lordes Supper: I haue lykewise annexed in thee later en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, the absurde errours wherevnto they fall, who wolde defende therein a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presence. Wherefore as I doe this of a good wyll, so wishe thou me good, and wishe that mine enemies maye bee more charitable, yea and (not withstāding their hatred) that yet towardes them I maye bee proffitable: which shalbe, if they reade my workes, &amp; that but with some indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie.</p>
