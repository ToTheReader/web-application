   <head>TO THE MOST NOBLE AND WORTHIE OF ALL HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRS, AND ALL TITLES, <hi>THOMAS</hi> EARLE OF SVFFOLKE, LORD HIGH TREASVRER OF ENGLAND.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y most honoured Lord, as it would argue avaine presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to importune you with trifles, of whom the weightie burthen of this Estate doth chiefly depend; so to distrust of your Noble acceptance of the least tributes of dutie and seruice which shall be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto you, would shew a weakenesse and want of judgement in me, hauing had such worthie testimonies of honourable fauour, both in countenancing my poore and weake labours, in bringing me againe into the world, and giuing me new life: for after eight yeares spent for the publique seruice of this Estate, in France, seeing my Starre without light in our Horizon, and the hopes of my seruice, or of further imployments dead, I retired my selfe to this fruitlesse course of life, to the end I might deceiue the houres of my idle time, and leaue some testimonie to the world of my liues imployment; during the which I haue past ouer France, the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and Spaine, vnder your L. honourable prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;<pb facs="3"/> and now declining towards my graue, and being readie to bid the world adieu, I haue aduentured to take a generall suruey of all the world, and to bring a trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor home, to make vs a true relation of all Estates and Countries in our owne language, I doubt not but he wil giue your L. some content, if your most weightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires will lend you any spare houres to peruse him. The title he beares on his forehead, shews the subject wheron he treats. My most humble suit is, That your L. would be pleased to patronize this last labour of an old man, whom a desire to shew his dutiful obseruance, hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, beyond the faculties of his weake bodie, to finish this worke, to the end he might leaue as it were a dying testimonie of his seruice, and let future ages know, that he did both liue and dye</p>
