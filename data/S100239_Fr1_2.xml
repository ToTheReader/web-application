      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING receaued the honour, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines to be a member of your Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and on the other side, hauing done you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dishonour, by leading
<pb facs="3"/>an vnprofitable life at least, and most vnvvorthy of the high vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being a Catholike; I haue had too much reason to cast my thoughtes vpon thinking, hovv I might make you some little part of amendes. Nothing came to my mind (vvhich might also be vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the measure of my povver) but the presenting you vvith this Book; vvhich, togeather vvith my selfe, I cast at the feet of you all, vvith an humble and most reuerend affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our Lord doth knovv, hovv much need I haue of all your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the high account, vvhich I make of them; vvhereby you may ghesse, hovv much in earnest I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the same.</p>
   <p>And because there is amongst you a Religious Person, a true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant &amp; spouse of Christ our Lord,
<pb facs="3"/>by vvhose meanes, through the goodnes of God, I am grovvne to an increase of some good desires to doe him Seruice; and vvho made much impression vpon my mind, tovvards the making me translate this very Booke; I do also dedicate it, to the same person, in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler manner, as a token of Eternall Gratitude. And I beg of that Soule, that vvhen, by vvay of Exchange, for the great Treasures, vvhervvith God hath trusted her, she shallbe remitting her deuout Petitions to that diuine Maiesty; the necessityes of myne, may not be layd aside.</p>
   <p>Our Lord Iesus graunt, by the precious merits of his bitter Passion (vvhich I beseech him to apply to vs all, by the intercession of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculately conceaued Mother, the Queene of Heauen) that vve, vvho
<pb facs="4"/>by his grace, are in these difficult tymes, made members of his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church</hi> (vvhich to vs indeed is so truely <hi>Militant</hi>) may one day, by his goodnes, arriue to be also mēbers of the <hi>Triumphant.</hi> Where clearely, and, at once, vve shalbe sure to see, and vvonder, at the inestimable riches of Mercy, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith our Lord did choose vs fevv, out of so many millions of soules, to professe his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fayth,</hi> vvith so much preiudice to our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, in all those thinges, vvhich the Foolish and Childish World is vvont to hold so deare. Only vve must take care, that vve continue in it, to, and in the end; and in the meane tyme, also to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Fayth, by such good vvorks as may become this high Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for else vve shall but double
<pb facs="4"/>our damnation. Our Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from falling into that Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of misery; and enable vs by his holy Grace, so to serue and suffer for him heere, that Eternally vve may adore him in Heauen.</p>
