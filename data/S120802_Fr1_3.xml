   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL AND Of high Desert, the Lady MARY <hi>Lewkenor</hi> and M<seg rend="sup">ris</seg>
      <hi>Elizabeth Lewkenor,</hi> the Mother and sorrowfull Widdow of this Deceased Gentleman: together with the right worshipfull and truly noble Lady, the Lady <hi>Anne Le-strange</hi> Wife to Sir <hi>Nicholas Le-strange</hi> Baronet: As also to her two vertuous and worthy sisters, Mistris <hi>Katherine</hi> and Mistris <hi>Mary Lewkenor,</hi> Eternall Happinesse, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oth I am (right <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull</hi> and truely <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>) that this rough &amp; unpolished discourse of mine, should unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately renew Your former griefe, or fill those Eyes againe with <hi>teares,</hi> which were never fully dried sithence
<pb facs="50"/>
this heavy <hi>Accident befell this Noble Plant,</hi> so neere, so deere unto you. For sorrow <hi>(I know right well)</hi> is of a quick and apprehensive <hi>nature,</hi> &amp; that the least touch maketh the <hi>Vessell easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow.</hi> How ever, <hi>I humbly intreate,</hi> that mine <hi>innocency herein,</hi> may <hi>answer</hi> for me: my ayme beeing chiefly this, <hi>to strew onely some few flowers upon the Hearse of this my honourable friend,</hi> such as in his life time, his owne Hand <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,</hi> pleasant unto the <hi>Eye,</hi> and of a most odoriferous <hi>Sent.</hi> Neither is this <hi>Treatise of mine</hi> otherwise inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but to bee a true <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> to tell succeeding <hi>Ages</hi> the greatnesse <hi>of the losse;</hi> when your renowned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was by the Untimely <hi>Death</hi> of this so Hopefull a Young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> thus fatally smitten, if not quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
<pb facs="50"/>
This <hi>Towne</hi> which now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth me my being, formerly affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mee my first <hi>breath.</hi> And foure generations of your honourable <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> haue I seene here upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> successiuely <hi>acting</hi> their several <hi>Parts. Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> were the lookers on, and with great applause, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their true <hi>Action,</hi> &amp; generous <hi>demeanour.</hi> But now alas, the <hi>Theater</hi> is wholy empted, and all the <hi>Actors</hi> quite gone, the <hi>Stage</hi> hourely expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be pulled down; and if it stand, yet little hope there is that ever our eyes <hi>shall see</hi> such <hi>Actors</hi> any more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to play their parts so commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as those Antients did. The consideration whereof, as it carrieth with it not onely trouble, but indeed a kind of <hi>amazement,</hi> so is there much
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>wisedom</hi> required in censuring and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> in induring what is <hi>hapned.</hi> My humble request therfore <hi>(unto you right Worshipfull)</hi> is, as those that haue the greatest <hi>share</hi> in this unvaluable losse, that in the middest of so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Thoughts in searching out the true cause and end that the Almighty hath in doing this, you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to remember these three Things: First, that there is in <hi>God</hi> an unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>will,</hi> that his <hi>Judgements</hi> are <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable,</hi> and his <hi>Waies</hi> past finding out. Secondly, that <hi>You</hi> would bee pleased to looke backe upon the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of your Family, <hi>which</hi> formerly, <hi>You</hi> have both seene and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. Beleeve mee, <hi>right worshipfull,</hi> the sight thereof will be a Soveraigne preservatiue against <hi>Repining.</hi> Lastly,
<pb facs="3"/>
that seeing it was determined, by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and inevitable <hi>decree</hi> (that the Sirnames of your Family, <hi>should</hi> heere fatally end) that you would bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to solace and <hi>cherish</hi> your Hearts, that it is done without the least spot and <hi>blemish</hi> to the same. And that this young <hi>Gentleman</hi> so honourably concluded, and closed up all so happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Hee hath done, to his immortall praise.</p>
   <p>But I desire not to tell the Travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the way hee knoweth so well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; or light a Candle when the Sunne is up, or leade the hand of the skilfull Artist. Here therefore I doe humbly take my leaue, desiring You to accept of what is done heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the Fruite of that unfeigned Loue, and dutiful Respect which <hi>was</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
alwayes borne by him, to your Honourable and worthy Family, who still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth</p>

         <hi>Yours in the Lord to be commanded to the uttermost of his power untill Death:</hi> Tymothy Oldmayne.</signed>
