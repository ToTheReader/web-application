   <p>This is all our infirmity, no tidings more grieuous to us, then when wee heare of the death of those whom wee loue. The Parent bewailes his Childe, the Husband his Wife, the Friend laments the death of his Friend, and wee thinke it the losse of another friend to depart with this our griefe. <hi>Iacob</hi> mourned for <hi>Ioseph</hi> his sonne, <hi>that hee would not bee comforted</hi> of a long season, but thought hee would <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 3.</note> weepe for him as long as he liued.

So heauie a thing wee see it is to bee seuered for a time from those that are deare vnto us. One onely thing there is, which is able in this case much to temper our affections; when we see our friend to die in the Lord; that is, in comfort of conscience, and assurance of saluation through <hi>Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This blessed departure God giues to many, for diuers good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. First, that the world may know that peace is the end of the iust, and comfort in death is the portion of the righteous. Secondly, That his eternall truth in our holy profession may appeare to bee able to comfort us, not only in our life, but in our death also, when all other comforts forsake vs. Thirdly, that our enemies may see our faith is not in vaine. Fourthly, that the weake by their example may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to a holy life, when they see it bring with it so happy a death, and that they may be strengthened against the feare of death, seeing it is alwayes comfortable to those that lead a godly life. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and finally, that the friends of the departed, by their heauenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, may be admonished not to mourne so much for their death, as to reioyce for their life, <hi>and to thanke God, that euer it was their lot, in any degree to be ioyned or matched with so blessed seruants of God.</hi>

This Gentlewoman, Mistresse <hi>Katherine Brettergh</hi> was one of this number: her life, as long as God continued it, was deere to those among whom she was, as the life of a friend might be. Her husband, friends, kinsfolks, brethren, sisters, and all the godly that knew her, enioyed a great blessing of God of her: and her death (no doubt) was grievous to her husband, as the death of a vertuous yokefellow.</p>
   <p>This is the thing I thought with profit might bee presented to the view of other also that knew her not: for when I had for my owne priuate vse, and the vse of my friends faithfully collected (out of the fresh memories of those that were present, and eie-witnesses as well as my selfe) and set downe the manner of her sicknesse and death: I considered, that the knowledge thereof could not but bee welcome to all those that desire to dye the death of the righteous. And so the same causes that moued me to collect it, gaue mee also occasion to publish it. I remembred the saying of one, <hi>That it is is great piety to set forth the vertues of the departed, if they haue excelled therein; yea it is</hi>

         </gap>ilii.</note>
      <hi>a meanes to encrease grace in our selues.</hi> I thought so great mercie of God shewed to one among vs, ought not to be forgotten, but should remaine to us and our children an example, to teach vs how good God is to them that loue him, and to assure vs that he will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs; but, in like manner as he did her, helpe and comfort vs, when we shall by death be called vnto him. I considered the vngodly and vncharitable tongues of the <hi>Papists</hi> abiding in our Country, who, since her death, haue not ceased to giue it out, that she died despairing, and by her comfortlesse end, shewed that she professed a comfortlesse Religion. Wherein they bewray their malice and madnesse, and shew themselues of what generation they are, euen a people (saith <hi>Ieremie) which bend their tongues like bowes for lies: and</hi> (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) <hi>make</hi>

      <hi>ready their arrowes to shoot at them which are vpright in heart.</hi> And lastly, when I remembred the censure giuen by our Sauiour Christ of the woman, that powred costly oyntment on his head, a little before his Passion, though some of his Disciples vniustly blamed her for the same, saying, <hi>What needed this wast?</hi> yet he himselfe did not only excuse her for that fact, saying, <hi>shee did it to bury him:</hi> but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that <hi>wheresoeuer the Gospell should bee preached throughout the world, there also that which shee had done should bee spoken of, for a</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note>
      <hi>memoriall of her.</hi> Euen so, seeing this vertuous Gentlewoman hath been vniustly accused by some popish persons, I thought it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>it, that she should not onely be iustly excused, but also that a true history of her holy life, and Christian death, should be now published in print, as a briefe history to be seene and read for a memoriall of her.</p>
   <p>I had no other odours wherewith to embalme her, I am but the penman, the thing it selfe was her owne, wrought in her by the spirit, of diuine prouidence, the which God grant that we may all imitate.</p>
