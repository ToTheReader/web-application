Dudley, Earle of Leycester, Baron of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh,
Knight of the Honorable order of the Garter,

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ighting of late
(Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
vpon this
treatise of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
penned by
an experienced
Italiā, &amp; drawn for the profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in to so many lāguages: I thought
his lessons fit for our store, &amp; sought
to make him speake Englishe.</p>
   <p>Wise was that Cato, that ended
bothe his learning, and liuing day
together. And truly, Courtesie and
Courtiership, be like Hippocrates
<pb facs="3"/>
twinnes, that laughe together, and
grow together: and are so one affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that who so diuorceth them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroieth
them. But yet, seeing moe
redie to condemne the least trip then
commend the best meaning, and
knowing that the Scarre sticketh
thogh good desert do hele the woūd:
&amp; perceiuing that <hi>Naeuus in arti
culo pueri delectat Alcaeū, &amp; Ro
scij oculi peruersissimi catulum,</hi>
That is, many dote on their fansie:
I durst not sēd this, mine Heyre &amp;
firste fruites of my toile, to the view
of the world, without the guarde of
your Patronage, wherin there is no
presumption to teach them that are
perfected, but may serue either as
<hi>Simonides Characters,</hi> to stablish
<pb facs="3"/>
memory, or as an Index, to point thē
to other behauiours enrolled wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
Spread therefore (I beseeche
your honour) the winges of welly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ouer this worke, which presseth
to you, as not only the patrone to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tect,
but the patterne to expresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
courtesie therin cōteined. Mine
Authour reporteth one <hi>Maestro
Chiarissimo</hi> a perfect Masō, whē
he had described the finest precepts
of his art, to haue made his <hi>Regolo</hi>
a pyller so exactly, as would beare
the proofe of euery demonstration,
thinking it learned speedely, where
the mind and the eye, precept and
experience ioyned hands together:
whose steps I tread (though with bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
successe then mine Author, who
<pb facs="4"/>
could not finde a Regolo) hoping,
when others shall come to trie these
preceptes, not by showe or sound, as
fooles do their Golde: but, by your
behauiour, as by the touchstone: whē
they shal come, not token aloofe, but
at hand, to view your so singular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
so ciuil, so courteous, as ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
you renoumed abrode, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
at home: coueted of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest,
&amp; wonderful of the learnedst:
when they shall in the glasse of
your courtesie, see the blots that ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe
the dignitie of their estate:
when they cōpare these lessons with
the Regolo, they shal herein see no
lesse commoditie, then was in Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades
Sileni (wherevnto Socrates
was compared) whiche though they
<pb facs="4"/>
bare not, in the front, any shewe of
singularitie: yet within, bare they
pictures of excellent wit &amp; delight.
This worke, if it please your honour
to vouchsafe as a companion of ease
to trace the pathes, which you haue
already so well beaten, (which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
not to be guide for conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
or if your honour daine at highe
leasure to peruse it (whiche is not
cūningly but faithfully translated)
I doubt not, but your cōuntenance
will so credit the Author, as wil em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
him to presse amongst the
thickest throng of Courtiers: And
herewithall beseeche your honour,
to accept the humble and dutifull
meaning minde of him: who, not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
till he might by some meanes
<pb facs="5"/>
giue shewe of his thankefull minde,
for your honorable fauours shewed
vnto him, hathe offered this small,
though as faithfull a gyfte as <hi>Sinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
did to <hi>Cyrus:</hi> hoping, that your
honour will take it as well in worth,
as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did his poore <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
handfull of water. Thus with
hartie prayer, for the aduauncemēt
of your estate, increase of honor, &amp;
attainement of perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
felicitie: I cōmend your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to the patronage and protectiō
of the Almightie. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
moste humble to dispose and
commaunde.</p>
