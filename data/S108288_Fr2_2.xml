      <hi>THE AVTHORS</hi> PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T falles out often, that the effects of mens actions comes cleane contrarie to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Authour. The same finde I by experience (beloued Reader) in my Poëme of <hi>LEPANTO:</hi> For although till now, it haue not bene imprinted, yet being set out to the publick view of many, by a great sort of stoln Copies, purchast (in truth) without my knowledge or consent, it hath for lack of a Praeface, bene in some things miscōstrued by sundry, which I of verie purpose thinking to haue omitted, for that the writing therof, might haue tended in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to some reproach of the skilfull learnednes of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as if his braines could not haue conceaued so vncuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a worke, without some maner of Commentarie, and so haue made the worke more displeasant vnto him: it hath by the contrary falen out, that the lack therof, hath made it the more displeasant to some, through their mistaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I knowe, the special thing misliked in it, is, that I should seeme, far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my degree and Religion, like a Mercenary Poët, to penne a worke, <hi>ex professo,</hi> in praise of a forraine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist bastard: I will by setting downe the nature and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="33"/> of the Poëme, resolue the ignorant of their error, &amp; mak the other sort inexcusable of their captiousnes. The nature then of this Poëme, is an argument, <hi>à minore ad majùs,</hi> largely intreated by a Poetike comparison, beeing to the writing hereof mooued, by the stirring vppe of the league and cruell persecution of the Protestants in all countries, at the very first raging wherof, I compiled this Poëme, as the exhortatiō to the persecuted in the hinmost eight lines thereof doth plainely testifie, being both begun and ended in the same Summer, wherein the league was published in France. The order of the Cantique is this: First, a Poetique Praeface, declaring the mater I treat of: wherein, I name not <hi>DON-IOAN,</hi> neither literally nor any waies by description, which I behooued to haue doone, if I had penned the whole Poëme in his praise, as <hi>VIRGIL, Arma virumque cano, &amp; HOMER, Dic mihi musa virum,</hi> of whose imitatiō I had not bene ashamed, if so my purpose had bene framed. Next followes my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation to the true God only, and not to all the He and She Saints, for whose vaine honors, <hi>DON-IOAN</hi> fought in all his wars. Next after my inuocation, follows the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etique History of my comparison, wherin following furth the ground of a true History, (as <hi>VIRGIL</hi> or <hi>HOMER</hi> did) like a painter shadowing with vmbers a portrait els drawn in grosse, for giuing it greter viuenes, so I eike or paire to the circumstaunces of the actions, as the rules of the poeticke art will permit: which Historicke compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son continues till the song of the Angels: in the which I compare and applie the former comparison to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent estate, taking occasion thereupon to speake some what of our religion. Lastlie the Epilogue of the whole in the
<pb facs="33"/> last eight lines, declares fully my intention in the whole, and explaines so fullye my comparison and Argument, from the more to the lesse, as I cannot without shamefull repetition speake anie more therof. And in a word: what so euer praise I haue giuen to <hi>DON-IOAN</hi> in this Poëme, it is neither in accompting him as first or second cause of that victorie, but onely as of a particular man, when hee falles in my way, to speake the truth of him. For as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not the honour of my estate, like an hireling, to pen the praise of any man: So becomes it far lesse the highnes of my rancke and calling, to spare for the feare or fauor of whomsoeuer liuing, to speake or write the trueth of anie. And thus crauing pardon (beloued Reader) for this long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Apologie (beeing driuen thereto, not by nature, but by necessitie) I bid you hartely fare-well.</p>
