   <head>To the Religious, Vertuous, and noble Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Smith Knight; the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of both worlds, this present, and that to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I present vnto your view, a book of prayers; not that you neede my weake instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for you are knowne to be a good proficient in Gods Schoole, and haue more of this heauenly language in you by heart, then I can teach you by precept. The tree of sound Religion flourisheth
<pb facs="9"/>
in your bosome, and beareth (both in the eie of man (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) and (inwardly) to God) much, and very much good fruit. You thereby proue your selfe a confirmed Christian: and shall giue further testimonie of your being so, if you incourage o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers (that are weake) to feed vpon this milke for babes, by tasting of it your selfe. They (by you) shall be led into the path of goodnes, if you but vouchsafe to walk out before them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the way. Foure Birds (of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke) haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken foure seueral flights. The Doue (which is the first) flies to your hand; not by chance,
<pb facs="9"/>
but vpon good choice, as knowing you to be a Doue your selfe. The badge which a Doue weares, is innocence: and by wearing that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Armor, you defended your selfe, and returned safe out of the Lions denne with <hi>Daniel,</hi> whē it was thought you should haue bin deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. God hath since heaped Graces on your head, and by the hands of his Anointed hath rewarded you with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued honours, in the selfe same place, into which you were throwne to be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp by destructiō. Receiue therfore (I beseech you) a Doue, sithence her harmeles &amp; spotles wings haue caried
<pb facs="10"/>
you ouer such great danger to so great happines.</p>
   <p>In her bill she brings a branch, vpon which growes seueral sorts of fruit, &amp; al of thē wholsome for the soule. You are the first to whose hād they are offred: if any others gather thē after you, &amp; find in them the sweetnes of the food of life, they shall (as I) pray to God, that his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings may stil more &amp; more be multiplied so long vpon you, til the last garlād which he keepes in store for those that run their race (here) wel, may be to you a crown of heauenly blessednes.</p>
