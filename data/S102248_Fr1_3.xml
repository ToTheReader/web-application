   <head>TO MY SONNE EDWARD FITZHERBERT.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>INDNES, saith the prouerbe, wil creepe where it can not goe; The meaning is, if I be not deceiued, that such is the force of loue and affection, that when it can not manifest it selfe so amply as it wold, it wil show it selfe in some sort as it may; the which is now verified in me; For, wheras I haue neuer hetherto had the meanes, &amp; oportunity to manifest my affection towards you, by reason of my departure from you and my cuntry, in your infancy, &amp; my continual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence euer since, (for the space of these three and twenty yeres) I can no longer forbeare to geue you some testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my loue, by the particular addresse of this treatise vnto you; For, although I intend it generally to al my cuntrymen, for the publyk good, yet I can not but wish the best part of the benefit to you, to whom the fruite of al my labours is most due, both by a special prerogatiue of nature, and also by the particular priuiledge of my owne desire, and your desert.</p>
   <p>Therfore, to the end you may reape the benefit which I wish you of this treatise, you shal vnderstand, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though part of the subject is policy, yet my meaning is not to animat you to the study, or practise therof, for that in my many yeres trauel, &amp; seruice of forrayne princes, (wherin I haue obserued the successe of many, great
<pb facs="3"/> negotiations, &amp; bene my selfe emploied in some) I haue learned by experience, that the old prouerb, <hi>Of little med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling commeth great ease,</hi> is verified in nothing more then in matters of state; the practise wherof may wel be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the vse of fire, which though it be most necessary for man, yet is most dangerous to deale with, and doth men some times irreparable dammages, be they neuer so circumspect. And this I say, for that I haue knowne very many stats-men of greate sufficiency, much perplexed, and diuers ruined, not so much by their owne inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as by the difficulties, and dangers incident to the handling of state-matters, which are subiect to infinit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and hazards, impossible to be fore-seene and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, by the witt, or industry of man; And therfore the only point of state, which I wold haue you to learne, or at least to practise, is, to serue God and your prince, with al duty and loyalty, yeelding (as our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth) <hi>To Caesar that vvhich is Caesars;</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.</note>
      <hi>and to God, that vvhich is Gods:</hi> And euer to perswade your selfe, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty ioyned with piety, &amp; prudent simplicity, is the hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hest and surest policy that may be: for as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith; <hi>Qui ambulat simpliciter,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.</note>
      <hi>ambulat confidenter, &amp; qui deprauat vias suas manifestus erit. He vvhich vvalketh simply and plainly, vvalketh cōfidently &amp; surely, &amp; he that rūneth an vndirect course shal be made manifest.</hi> And this our Sauiour also taught his Apostles,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Natth.</hi> 10.</note> and vs al, when he said. <hi>Estote Prudentes sicut serpentes, &amp; simplices sicut columba. Be you prudent like to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and simple like to the doue;</hi> whereof I shal not neede to say more vnto you here, for that I haue sufficiently hādled this matter in this treatise, in the which I wold wish you for your better instructiō, to obserue specially these points following.</p>
   <p>The first is; The natural imbecillity of mans wit; the

      </gap>uer-weening of his owne wit (the danger wherof I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eclared in the first, and second Chapter) but also haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

      </gap>ans infirmity; that is to say, continual praier to him for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he light and helpe of his grace, and the councel of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, and wise frends; of both which points I haue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ules for young statists; wherto I remit you.</p>
   <p>The second obseruation which I wish you to make, is, of the course of Gods prouidence in the affaires of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s how he disposeth not only of kingdomes and states, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>olicies, and power, as also of al other his creatures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>idental, for the execution of his holly wil, and secret <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>For he that alwaise hath the prouidence of God before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> prosperity, nor deiected with sorrow in aduersity, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>et dismayed with the apprehention of dangers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waise holdeth an euen and stedfast course, resigned to Gods wil, grateful for his benefits, not repining at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>unishments, knowing that al wil turne to his good, if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ault be not in him selfe; whereby the seruants of God
<pb facs="4"/> receiue infinit cōsolation, wheras those who haue not the like consideration of Gods prouidence, haue neither any stay of them selues in prosperity, nor any true comfort in aduersity, but being no lesse dissolute in the one, then des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in the other, perish many tymes in both, through Gods iust Iudgement. And although you shal find matter considerable concerning this poynt, throughout this whole discourse, yet I specially recommende two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to your reading, to wit the 25. and 26. where I haue declared the causes why God permitteth good men to be afflicted, and wicked men to prosper in this world, which being wel waied may yeeld you, as I hope, both consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and instruction.</p>
   <p>The third poynt to be obserued is, the seuere Iustice of God in the punishment of sinne,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note>
      <hi>(Visiting the iniquityes of parents vpon the children vnto the 3. and 4. generation)</hi> which as I haue made most euident in princes, and their states, so may it also be obserued in priuate men, and particular families. Therfore the instruction, which I wold wish you to take by this point, is, that the true cause of the decay and ouerthrow of most families, is the same that I haue showed by euident examples to be the ruin of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp; states, to wit the sinnes of men, punished eyther in them selues, or in their children and posterity, wherby whole families are extirped, races extinguished, ancient houses decaied, and personnal defects, or imperfections, continued sometimes in families for many decents.</p>
   <p>Wherby it may appeare, how simple they are, who hope to eternize their names and families, by wicked meanes, and how absurdly many men vse to saye, that he is happy whose father goeth to the deuil (because wicked men leaue many times their children rich, with il gotten goods) whereas experience teacheth, that although God of his
<pb facs="4"/> secret Iudgements suffreth euil men to prosper for a while for such causes as I haue signified in the 26. Chapter) yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e punisheth them, and dissipateth their ill gathered sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nto you, in reading this treatise.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>In like manner, whereas I haue interlaced many thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> against Atheists, which you, and other good Christians, may perhaps omit to reade, as not pertaining any way to you, I think good to aduertise you, that you may also find therin matter woorth your consideration, for that I haue by the occasion of their obiections, cleared diuers douts, explicated many difficultyes, &amp; decyded some notable questions; which may serue, not only for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Christian fayth, but also for the edification of any good Christian reader, yea and stirre him vp to the admiration of Gods infinite wisdome, iustice, mercy bounty, &amp; omnipotent power, and to the due reuerence, and feare of his inscrutable Iudgements.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, hauing had desire both to delight, &amp; profit my readers, I haue sowed in this my gardain (as I may tearme it) the seede as wel of moral, as of political doctrin, and haue watered it aboundantly with al kind of history, yea more perhaps then wil seeme conuenient to some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and seuere censurers, who may desire to haue al things restrained to the limits of their lyking; Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, I wold haue such to vnderstand if any such there be that I haue bene the more copious in examples, for the better and more cleare confutation of Macchiauillian, &amp; Atheistical politikes, who referring al the effects of Gods secret Iudgements, yea and of many of their owne errours to chance, are best conuinced by experience, which is cheefely deduced from history, and showed best by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of examples.</p>
   <p>Therfore I wold haue you to think that I inuite you to the reading of this treatise, as to a gardain, in the which I hope you shal find variety of faire flowers, and holsome hearbs; wherof I wish you first to take a ful view, &amp; after to make your selfe a nosegay of what you like best, for I
<pb facs="5"/> can not expect that you, or any other, wil like and allow, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>f euery thing alike, which I treate, or teach in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, no more then it can be expected, that many guests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
