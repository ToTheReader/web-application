      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that doth publish a matter to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many, the same requireth to be done, not lightlie but deliberatlie; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it is subiect to sundrie Censures, and in reading and iudging all are not <hi>Candidi Lectores.</hi> In regard whereof, (good Christian Reader) I haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed my paines to thy profite, and presented the liking of it to thy looking ouer, hauing (as nigh as I may) not onelie cut off all such occasions, as might cause cauillation; but also ministred such matter as concernes our consolation: and although it bee not polished preciselie for the expectation of the curious, yet it is finished plainlie for the information of the simple. Now it may bee, there bee many that will vse obiections against the triple forme of this treatise; because no Arte hath reduced all things (and rightly) to <hi>Dicotomies.</hi> True; but wisedome may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue much compendiously, and yet profitablie: besides although I haue framed it as an easie enterance for the erudition of the ignorant, J haue not excluded what may further be added by the consideration of the learned: and albeit much more might be inserted in many places for prolixitie, yet much lesse I feare me is obserued of the most part for their vtilitie. Some will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more direct placing of thinges in their order. Certes that is well placed that is well applied; and those that do more respect the manner of placing than the matter it selfe, may be noted in the number of those, who would haue the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> to precede, and not to follow the booke of <hi>Iob;</hi> making a scrupulous question without cause, when wee all knowe they are both included in the Scriptures, &amp; containe comfortable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our saluation. Some will not like so many diuers sorts of
<pb facs="4"/> sundrie things congest together in one heape, other will require more perspicuitie, some one thing, some another. Insomuch, as he that expecteth to please the opinions of all people, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refraine from open publication of any thing, or referre himselfe to their generall dispositions in iudgement: and this is the common successe of acceptance; many will commend it, most will mislike it, fewe will followe it. But as my meaning was to profite the simple by the setting foorth of it, so I shall perswade the godlie to a good liking of it: and as for the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I will not refell their foolish questions in disputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, knowing what the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> saith, that foolish and vnlearned questions ingender strife. So,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.23.</note> wishing all to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure others by the met they would receiue themselues, and so to report as they expect in any enterprise, I both submit my self to reprehension, so it be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and commit euery one to his owne liking, so it bee indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. <hi>Vale.
