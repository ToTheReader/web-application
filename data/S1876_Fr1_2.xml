      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ime hath proued that by experience (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> by the spirit of Prophecie foreshewed; <hi>The Diuel</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time:</hi> for this Prophecie is fulfilled, not only in the outragious fury that Sathan vseth in raising persecution against Gods Saints, by his mischieuous instruments, &amp; corrupting mens minds by his wicked suggestions, but also in tyrannizing, according to his limited power ouer them by torments. This first kind of cruelty the former Ages haue felt whē the third part of the Sunne, and the Moone, and the Stars were smitten by the Roman Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and stinged by the Turkish scorpions, and other lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs of the like stamp: the other maner of villany hath shewed her fruites too plentifully in this our age in the cooling of Charitie, &amp; quenching of the Spirit, that our Sauiours Prophecie (which cannot be farre off) may be fulfilled, <hi>When the Sonne of man commeth, shal he find faith on the earth?</hi> And this last kind of tiranny is too aparant amongest other instances, in the pittifull vexing of this poore distressed child: And as the Holie-ghost hath left such conflicts for the spiritual warfare of his children, so hath he not left them without weapōs to withstand the fury of their enemies▪ for in temporal persecutions &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they haue Patience for their buckler, that they may learne to say of them with <hi>Iob, Blessed be the name of the Lord▪</hi> and in all maner of temptations of Sathan, they haue the whole armor of God, yea and those weapons that are able to ouerthrow the Diuels strongest holdes, as shal well appeare euen in this small Treatise. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the strangenesse thereof, it is left to thy considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (gentle Reader) and for the trueth of it, if it should
<pb facs="3"/>
be called in question, as not vnlike▪ (for the abundaunce of false and friuolous deuises, broched in these dayes, a thing much to be lamented, do oft times abridge trueth of her credit) besides that for the particulars, a hundred more witnesses might be produced, than are here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and diuers of them of good woorth and credite, the matter it selfe is well knowne to the right Honourable sir <hi>Edmund Anderson</hi> Knight, Lord chiefe Iustice of the common plees, as being voluntarily confessed to him by the Witch, who was vpon the same arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted before his H. at Darby, and therfore is not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be excepted against. Besides also, that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by a priuate Christian &amp; man of trade, who being with the boy almost in all his fits, did both take notes at the present of all that was doone and spoken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred also afterward with the witnesses of best iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and credit, that he might be sure of that which hee had set downe. In a worde, I thinke there can scarcely be any instance shewed (the holy Scriptures excepted) whereby both the peeuish opinion, that there are no wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Popish assertion that only their priests can dispossesse, may be better controlled than by this. The first kind of people, I rather thinke are to be pittied, than confuted, daily experience crying out against their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The other may heereby see their too peremptorie conclusions ouerthrowne, since he whose aduise &amp; help was vsed in this matter, is very well knowne to bee a faithfull preacher of the Gospel, and so consequently an enemy to Poperie; wishing thee therefore so to regarde it as for the trueth and weight thereof it shal deserue, and to reape such fruit by it, as being well regarded it may yeelde, I bid thee farewell in Christ.</p>
