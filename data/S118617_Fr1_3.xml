      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y continuall imploymēts (Right Honourable) in the function of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, might put a strong <hi>Remora</hi> to my pen, to stay me from farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying my vnskilfulnes in writing, had not my intire loue to <hi>Sion</hi> ouerswayed all difficulties, and vanquished all laboures and impediments. These <hi>2. Sermons</hi> I preached before a great and iuditious <hi>Auditorie.</hi> The one, which I haue intituled; <hi>The Iudges and Iuries In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> by commaund of authoritie, long since before the <hi>Iudges,</hi> at the <hi>Assises</hi> at <hi>Lanceston,</hi> when that worshipfull <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="4"/> Sir Bernard Greynuile,</hi> my good <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> was <hi>Shieriffe</hi> of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> The other <hi>(The Christians Comfort)</hi> is more recent: And chancing of late vpon certayne Copies and notes, pretended to bee taken from my mouth, as I then deliuered them, I found some maymed and defectiue, some patched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an indigested maner, and other vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false and mistaken; which hath enforced me (and the rather through the importunitie of some of my best friends) to search out the originall, and to disrobe this forlorne of-spring of his counterfeite colours, and patched coate; and to put vpon him his owne suite, though in the playnest fashion, without any curious dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or trimming. Which when I had effected (I confesse) my ambiguous thoughts were tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed too and fro for a while, in a deepe and doubtfull <hi>dilemma</hi> (euery way conuincing) vnder whose <hi>Pratrocinie</hi> I might send forth this my poore abortiue <hi>Orphane</hi> abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: But at length my distracted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution presumed to alight vpon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Honourable name, to seeke shelter against enuie and detracting tongues, being imboldned by the generall report, and my owne tryall of your <hi>Honours heroicall</hi> propension, and noble disposition to pietie, learning, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb facs="4"/> Wherewith, and with all other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vertues fit for such a <hi>Personage,</hi> God hath so plentifully endowed you, that it were better in silence to passe that ouer, which I cannot sufficiently commend, then by taking vpon mee to illustrate your deserued prayses: I might (perchance) seeme to derogate from the worth thereof, by speaking too little (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being so perspicuous and eminent to the eyes of all men) that I might iustlie be taxed with this prouerbe; <hi>Solem lucerna osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</hi> And it might be sayd vnto me, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcides</hi>

But my desire and hope is, that it shall find that acceptance with your <hi>Honor,</hi> that <hi>Sinetas</hi> handfull of water did with the great <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes.</note> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie receiued it with alacritie of minde, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renitie of countenance, estimating the wiking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="5"/> of the Giuer, before the value of the gift, being the best that the poore man had to offer. And as <hi>Plinie</hi>
