<note place="margin">Matth. 21.41.</note> So that when I think of the number and great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of our sinnes, I cannot but wonder that the Lord should not <hi>haue with drawne his Kingdome long since from vs, and haue giuen it vnto others, that would haue brought foorth the frutes thereof.</hi> Yea, I wonder, that he hes not caused the <hi>Land to vomite vs out,</hi> for the abhominations and sinnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we haue defiled it, in so great a light.

   <p>Now, oh that the Lord would giue vs these hearts, and so purge vs, that we might be thus fruitfull to the praise of his glorie: then assuredly would he repent him of all the euill, that he hes thought against vs: then should he haue delite in vs and in our posterity: and then these <hi>Cananites</hi> (I mean the relickes of that cursed generation of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Kirk of Rome) whilk is yet left vn-rooted out of this land, to try vs, and tempt vs, if we will serue the Lord our God: and to be prickes and thornes in our side, should not bring vs in bondage again, but should be made tributaries to Iesus Christ: yea our latter estate, should be more glorious then the former.

Wherefore should they, O Lord our God, blaspheme thy holy Name, when they shall see thee angrie with thy owne inheritance and redeemed ones. Oh turne vs vnto thee, and put vs not away from thy face: and let not those that are thy enemies, triumph ouer vs. Purchase thy self an euerlasting name, through our conversion and repentance, that the enemie and the avenger may be still: and our hearts may be inlarged, &amp; our mouthes may be opened, to proclaime thy euerlasting mercies, and to shout forth thy praises. Turne you vnto him you that are his children, &amp; delites in his Tents. You that loue the beautie of Sion, and the glorious presence of his Redeemer, fill your priuie chambers with strong cries and many teares. Cause heauen and earth to be filled with grones and sighes of his owne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in you: and take a claught of that Prince of life, ere he remoue altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and before he haue stollen himself so far away, that he cannot be foūd againe. And wrastle with him as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and let him not departe out of your hearts: entreat him, yea enforce him, as it were, by your teares, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull cries, not to leaue his owne Tents, and Tabernacle in this land: not to giue ouer his glorious Gospell, whilk is his <hi>strength and glorie,</hi> into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, in the hands of their enemies. Remember that he cannot abyde the intercession of his owne Spirit in his owne. He cannot hide his eies from his owne flesh and blood, he can deny nothing to his owne beloued Son, that makes intercession for his Saints. Let vs therefore step vp to that Throne of grace with all confidence: and assuredly, as he is true who hes promised, we shall find grace and mercy in the time of this our need: both comfort to our owne hearts, and it may be peace in our daies, that our eies shall not see the euils that are to come: and at that bright appearing of our Lorde of life, all teares shalbe wypt away from our eies. We shalbe clothed with those long white robes, and shalbe sed with the fatnesse of his house, and shall drinke of the riuers of his pleasures, whilk is at his right hand for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. For Sions sake in this land Christian reader, haue I thus written vnto thee, and for Ierusalems cause, haue I not kept silence at this time: that her glory and wonted brightnesse may be renued, and that the Kirk of Scotland whilk was the bewtie of Europe, and the praise of the whole earth for her liberty purity, and discipline: might be established in the same, and her sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and righteousnesse, might break foorth as a burning lampe, to all the nations of the earth: and that other Kirks in other kingdomes, whilk desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to see our bewty and spirituall glory, and accounted them blissed whilk might haue had the occasion to haue dwelt in our Tents, to haue seene and enjoyed the same: yea who would haue beene contented to haue bought it with the price of their blood to their posterities: that they, I say, may see the continuance thereof, and may reioice. Turne thou O Lord our God, our hearts vnto thee, that thy glorious presence may be continued with vs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, for Iesus Christs sake our Lord and redeemer, to whome be al praise and glory, for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

   <p>Nowe I come to this matter in hande: the occasion of it was this. There was one who was sometimes an hearer of the word with me, who shewe me
<pb facs="14"/> that he had bene in conference with a Papist, and he had broght him thus far, that if I would shewe him of any that professed our religion before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther,</hi> he would renounce his Papistry: and therefore desired mee to set them downe in writ. The whilk I did: and set it downe in this forme, as thou sees it heir. So this being carried to Maister <hi>Gilbert Browne,</hi> he writes an answere to it, and sends it to me. Vnto the whilk I haue made this reply. Thou hes them all three their: first, that whilk I did write, then his answere to it, and then my reply to his answere.</p>
   <p>Indeed it is true, christian reader, that there was many thinges that did hinder me, and withdraw me from this resolution, either to make anye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it at all, or yet to let it goe forth to the light. As first, that so many thinges hes bene written alredie by the lightes and lanterns of this age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that ruinous Babell, that all further conuictions seemeth to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. Next, the conscience of my own tenuitie and weaknesse, together with a continuall burden of a fourfolde teaching euery weeke in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charge, beside others both priuate and publick duties, whilk not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my owne people, but also this desolate countrye craued, whereby I was letted to afforde that time and studie vnto it, as the grauitie of sik a matter required. And last of all, the consideration both of the person and worke of of the aduersary, that neither the one nor the other woulde bee accounted worthy of any answere at all, himself being both reiected and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated according to the expresse commandement of the holie Ghoste, as <hi>an heretick being peruerted and damned in his owne conscience, and deliuered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto sathan, that he might learne if it were possible not to blaspheme the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting trueth of God any more.</hi> And also denounced his rebell,
