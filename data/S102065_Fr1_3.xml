      <hi>To the Learned Authour on his</hi> Love-Melancholy.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>THou, that from this Gay Title, look'st no high'r</l>
      <l>Then some <hi>Don Errant,</hi> or his fullsome Squire:</l>
      <l>Who count'st the price a Damage, if thou meet</l>
      <l>No litle <hi>Cupid</hi> wrapt in every sheet:</l>
      <l>Sufely abhorre the bargaine of his Lure;</l>
      <l>Least vnawares, perhaps, thou buy a Cure.</l>
      <l>'Las, miserable Lover! What sad plight</l>
      <l>Would vexe thy soule, should'st thou be well ere night!</l>
      <l>Shouldst thou forget thy Postures! shouldst thou weare</l>
      <l>Armes of thy owne; not folded to Despaire!</l>
      <l>An high, erected Forehead! thy discourse</l>
      <l>Flow on securely; with no sigh made hoarse!</l>
      <l>What if these Ills befall thee, that from hence</l>
      <l>Thou shouldst, perhaps, recover Braine, and Sence?</l>
      <l>How couldst thou beare the stroake, if from this Pen</l>
      <l>Thou didst grow sound, and rise up man agen?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>These are our Authours vices; to apply</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>
A Cordiall, where the Patient faine would dy.</l>
      <l>Count not th' <hi>Erratas</hi> then: since if it be</l>
      <l>Solid, and firme; there all the mistakes ly.</l>
      <l>Poore, humble spirit! Fondly to behold</l>
      <l>The painted Drosse, yet startle at the Gold.</l>
      <l>Mai'st thou henceforth thy pension bestow,</l>
      <l>Instead of Bookes, only to graspe a show.</l>
      <l>Thy Pageant-study be adorn'd, and hung</l>
      <l>With Leaves, not so well writ, as fairely strung.</l>
      <l>Good lucke to thy Gilt-Leather. Such as, no doubt,</l>
      <l>Is a good worke, till th' Ribband's all worne out.</l>
      <l>Yet, if thou canst not forme thy wanton Eye</l>
      <l>To read a page more serious then thee.</l>
      <l>Jf thy sad Pill must be disguis'd, and woo</l>
      <l>Thy Palat with a Candid hoary dew.</l>
      <l>Expect no Tearmes, or Notions here: the stile</l>
      <l>Is not prescribed; tasts lesse o'th' shop, then File.</l>
      <l>Few Drammes, or Scruples grate thy tender Eare:</l>
      <l>No Opiats, or Gargarismes here.</l>
      <l>Nothing to sowre thy lookes: no Austere phrase,</l>
      <l>Which might perplexe thee, worse then thy disease.</l>
      <l>A straine, harsh as th' Ingredients; such, as wee</l>
      <l>Shall need no other Drugs to vomit by.</l>
      <l>Here, all, like thy owne Mistresse, smooth appeares.</l>
      <l>Stories, like those she tells thee, apt, and cleare.</l>
      <l>Such Elegancies interweav'd, you might</l>
      <l>Doubt, if he was Physitian, did write.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>If you would know how far Love reignes, here One</l>
      <l>Rages, inamour'd of a cold, pale stone.</l>
      <l>He sues t' his Patient Idoll, as the Clay</l>
      <l>Might be a Bride, ere <hi>Pyrrha</hi> threw't away.</l>
      <l>One courts his owne faire Picture, as if he</l>
      <l>Might, to himselfe, both Nymph, and Husband be.</l>
      <l>Like those <hi>Androgynes,</hi> which here you find,</l>
      <l>In the same Body t' involve either kind.</l>
      <l>Here one courts life: yet so, she cannot spit,</l>
      <l>But the Officious S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>, will gather it.</l>
      <l>Another doth on wrinkles doat as fast;</l>
      <l>And th' Chin, that drops it selfe downe to the Wast.</l>
      <l>Her hollow cheeke love's Temple, doth appeare.</l>
      <l>Her Eye! That kills not with a Beame too cleare:</l>
      <l>And, sure, th' Experienc'd Maid will passe on, free</l>
      <l>From that young sinne, the sale of chastity,</l>
      <l>A Dame, so modest, no Bribe can intice:</l>
      <l>So coy, that ev'n to her owne bed shee's Ice.</l>
      <l>Her Nose can't be so vast, but he will raise</l>
      <l>A Trumpet thence, to Eccho forth her praise.</l>
      <l>And though, all ore, It sure a Monster be,</l>
      <l>Yet, whilst his fit lasts, 'tis a Deity.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But whilst I thus bragge colour, J prophane</l>
      <l>The Nerves and Marrow of thy Weighty Veine:</l>
      <l>Who sound'st the depth of Authors, and canst tell</l>
      <l>Where <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doe well:</l>
      <l>Yet where they erre too, 'Tis not all thy skill,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>
Aw'd at some mighty Name, there to stand still.</l>
      <l>As if, in your profession, 'twere a sinne</l>
      <l>To out-goe <hi>Galens</hi> sober Discipline.</l>
      <l>Thou dost not bind thy liberall Art to come</l>
      <l>Within the compasse of One Axiome:</l>
      <l>Nor yet of One tongue: Who art Criticke growne</l>
      <l>As well in Language as in Potion.</l>
      <l>Greek, Latine, French, Italian, all, so much</l>
      <l>Thy owne, we doubt, whether thy Nurse were such.</l>
      <l>And yet, through all this danger of thy skill,</l>
      <l>Thou dost retaine God, and Religion still.</l>
      <l>Hence, then, with those rash clamours, which apply</l>
      <l>A prophane stampe to that blest Faculty.</l>
      <l>Amongst whom Charity is slander, Sure</l>
      <l>This is no piece of Atheisme to Cure.</l>
      <l>Health is the gift of Heaven. Nor dare I</l>
      <l>Thinke't may be stollen thence, through Blasphemy.</l>
      <l>May such Defamers, then, converted be</l>
      <l>By a Reforming Gout, or their owne Fee.</l>
      <l>May they be rack'd, and tortur'd, till they doe</l>
      <l>Send for Physitian, and adore him too.</l>
      <l>Till they, to him, pay their Devotion;</l>
      <l>And, almost, are, themselves the Atheists growne.</l>
      <l>Let them be Wild, and Melancholy looke,</l>
      <l>Nor find one Remedy through all this Booke.</l>
