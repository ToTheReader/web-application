                 <title>The eternall truth of scriptures, and Christian beleefe, thereon vvholly depending, manifested by it owne light : Deliuered in two bookes of commentaries vpon the Apostles creede: the former, containing the positiue grounds of Christian religion in generall, cleared from all exceptions of atheists or infidels. The later, manifesting the grounds of reformed religion to be so firme and sure, that the Romanist cannot oppugne them, but with the vtter ouerthrow of the Romish Church, religion, and faith.
