<pb facs="3"/> and soules, by the doctrines of blind-fold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that faith and truth is not to be kept with heretikes: he was not onely willing, all the time hee did reigne over vs, that we should pray to God, as we did in the dayes of Great ELIZABETH: <hi>That he would keepe vs from all Papistrie:</hi> and that he would <hi>preserue vs from the Pope, as well as from the Turke;</hi> in as much as the Pope laboured to dethrone Christ, as well as the Turke did: but hee required further of vs,<note place="margin">In the prayer to be made Nove. 5. in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our deliverance from the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder▪ Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> That wee should pray God <hi>to strengthen his handes, and the handes of his Nobles and Magistrates in the Land, to cut off the Papists, and to roote them out of the Confines and limits of the Kingdome:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing in one Parliament, <hi>That hee could not permit the increase and growth of Poperie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying the liberties both of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp; of the</hi> Crown <hi>in his posterity.</hi> And in another, <hi>That his heart bled when he heard of the increase of Popery: And that his griefe was such, as if thornes had beene in his eyes, and pricks in his sides:</hi> avowing earnestly, <hi>That if he knew any way better then another, to hinder the growth thereof, hee would take it.</hi> Which courses and speeches of his, argued no small dislike of
