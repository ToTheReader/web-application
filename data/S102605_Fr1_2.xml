It should be like the <hi>Neuer-too-well read Arcadia,</hi> where the <hi>Prose</hi> and <hi>Verce, (Matter</hi> and <hi>Words</hi>) are like his <hi>Mistresses</hi> eyes one still excelling another and without Coriuall for to come home to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars <hi>Element,</hi> like <hi>Friendly Shake-speares Tragedies,</hi> where the <hi>Commedian</hi> rides, when the <hi>Tragedian</hi> stands on Tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince <hi>Hamlet.</hi> But in sadnesse, then it were to be feared he would runne made Insooth I will not be moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, to please: nor out of my wits though I displeased all What? <hi>

      </gap> one: If you be angry, you are not well aduised. I will tell you, tis an Indian <hi>Humour,</hi> I haue snuft vp from diuine <hi>Tabacco:</hi> and tis most Gentleman-like to puffe it out at any place or person. Ile no <hi>Epistle,</hi> (it were worse then one of <hi>Hercules</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) But will conclude, honesty is a mans best vertue. And but for the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> and the two <hi>Sherisses,</hi> the Innes of Court, and many Gallants elsewhere, this last yeare might haue bene burned. As for <hi>Momus,</hi> Carpe and Barke who will: if the <hi>Noble Asse</hi> bray not, I am as good a Knight Poet, as <hi>Etatis suae,</hi> Maister <hi>An. Dom.</hi> Sonne in Law. Let your <hi>Cryticke</hi> looke to the Rowels of his spurs, the pad of his Saddle, and the Ierke of his Wand: then let him ride me and my Rimes as hotely an be would ride his Mistresse, I care not: We shall meete and be friends againe, with the breaking of a Speare or two: And who would do lesse, for a faire Lady. There I leaue you, where you shall euer finde me.</p>
   <p>Passionate <hi>Daiphantus:</hi> Your louing <hi>Subiect,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Giues you to vnderstand, <hi>He is A man in Print,</hi> and tis enough he hath vnder-gone a <hi>Pressing</hi> (yet not like a <hi>Ladie</hi>) though for your sakes and for <hi>Ladyes,</hi> protesting for this poore Infant of his Brayne, as it was the price of his Virginitie borne into the world in teares; So (but for a many his deare friends that tooke much paines for it) it had ayed, and neuer bene laught at: And that if <hi>Truth</hi> haue wrote lesse than <hi>Fixion,</hi> yet tis better to erre in Knowledge then in Iudgment. Also if he haue caught vp half a Line of any others, It was out of his <hi>Memorie</hi> not of any ignorance. Why, he Dedicates it to all, and not to any Particular, as his <hi>Mistresse,</hi> or So. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is, he is better Borne, than to creepe into <hi>Womens Fauours,</hi> and aske their leaue afterwards. Also he desireth you to helpe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect such errors of the Printer; which because the <hi>Authour</hi> is dead (or was out of the Citie) hath beene committed. And twas his folly, or the <hi>Stationers,</hi> You had not an <hi>Epistle</hi> to the purpose.</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus like a Louer, wooes he for your Fauor,</l>
      <l>VVhich if You grant then <hi>Omnia vincit Amor.</hi>
