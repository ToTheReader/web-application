   <head>To his kind Friend and Countryman W. Lithgow.</head>
   <l>THy well adventur'd Pilgrimage I prayse,</l>
   <l>Although perform'd with perill and with pain,</l>
   <l>Which thou hast penn'd, in more than vulgar phrase</l>
   <l>So curiously, so sweetly, smooth, and plain.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Yet whilst I wondring call to minde again.</l>
   <l>That thou durst go, like no man else that lives;</l>
   <l>By Sea and land, alone, in cold and raine,</l>
   <l>Through Bandits, Pirats, and <hi>Arabian</hi> Theeves,</l>
   <l>I doe admire thee; yet a good event</l>
   <l>Absolves a rash designe: So hardest things,</l>
   <l>(When humane reason cannot give consent</l>
   <l>T' attempt) attain'd, the greater glory brings.</l>
   <l>Then Friend, though praise &amp; pains rest both with thee,</l>
   <l>The use redounds unto the world, and mee.</l>
