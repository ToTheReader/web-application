   <head>TO THE RIGHT worshipfull Doctors: to the <hi>Worshipfull Maisters: and to the</hi> worthie Students of the Vniuersitie of Oxford.</head>
   <p>BEing admonished by a deare friend of myne, that this Treatise was defectiue, in that it wanted an Epistle Dedicatorie. I considered with my selfe, and resolued to recommend it vnto the Vniuersitie of Oxford, in respect that it was penned by a Scholler, and sometime a student of the said Vniuersitie. And I my selfe in my youth sucked the breasts of that Nurse. Often admiring the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple robes and decorum of the Doctors: accounting of them, as of the Senators and Sages of England. But yet euer detesting schisme and heresie in my hart, being by Gods prouidence and goodnes euen <hi>acunabulis</hi> from my cradle inclyned to Catholike faith and Religion. Whereupon I left my natiue soyle, and trauelled into forrayne Countries, where often reflecting with astonishment, that men of that outward grauitie, eloquence and learning should be so ouer-shaddowed with so darke a cloude of error, schisme, and heresie, and of so weake a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to thinke all the world to be ecclipsed. and that the light of the Gospel could shine onely from <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martir,</hi> two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata Fryers, or any such rabble. Returning into my Countrie, especially since his Maiesties happie raigne ouer Great Britaine. I ioyed much to see, as it were at our time, the prime places of Prelacie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed

   <p>Wherefore this liitle Treatise is addressed vnto you, Maisters and students of Oxford, and you who are in purple robes, as Senators and Sages of the land, that you may vncase your selues, cast off your viseards, expel the rauening Wolfes. And know your selues, and acknowledge your errours, schisme, and heresie, and returne to your mother Church, <hi>benigna mater est,</hi> she is a louing mother, to receaue you.

   <p>You know the Arch-bishop of Spalata, a learned Prelate, as you all confesse,<note place="margin">Archbishop of Spalato.</note> he conuersed vvith your prime Prelate, visited your Vniuersities, enformed himselfe of your doctrine, wayed your Church, &amp; Congregation, in his prudentiall ballence, and found you <hi>minus habens,</hi> to want wayt, to be schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall: he retyred himselfe with desire to returne home againe, not for that he mislyked his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynement; for he was highly esteemed of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, much honoured of your Prime Prelate, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by the Nobilitie, he had large maintenance 800. or a thousand pounde reuenew <hi>per annum,</hi> whereby hee might commaunde all the delicates, delites and pleasures that the land could yeeld, yet not satisfied in conscience, nor content in minde, labored to get licence of his Maiestie, to returne, which he obtained,<note place="margin">His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> or else was commanded by him to depart the Realme. Why did he thus? but reflecting vpon his estate, being aged, to prouide for death, to forsake schisme, to saue his soule. I am credible imformed, being vrged to declare his

minde,<note place="margin">His cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church of England.</note> &amp; what he thought concerning the Church of England; he clearely answered, that it was but a schismatical Church, a part diuided from the bodie mysticall of Christ, a congregation that had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the mother Church of the world. Consider and ruminate well (you worthie students) the sentence and censure of this learned Prelate Out of all doubt, there is no saluation, but in the true Church.</p>
   <p>There is not the meanest among you, if he doe but read the Annales of <hi>M.

And within some yeares after, he spoyled

the sepulchers and shrines of the Saints, and what was gold and siluer, and pretious stone,<note place="margin">Spoyled the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Saints.</note> either by oblations, offerings, or other waies not fearing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge a whitte, he tooke without scruple.

   <p>And to omitte other of his good vvorkes, in the 38 and last yeare of his raigne (a thing vvorth the noting) hauing had warres vvith France, and peace being concluded, it vvas proclaimed by Harralds, vvith sound of trumpet the 13. of Iune, being Whit sonday, and the same day a general Procession com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. in vvhich vvere borne all the richest syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Crosses in London, of euerie Parish one, and the Priestes in their richest Coapes. This Preces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion came from Paules Church through Cheape and Cornehill, vp to Leaden Hall, and so vvent backe to Pauls againe. This vvas the last shevv of rich Crosses and Coapes in London for shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all those Crosses and Coapes, vvith other the Church plate vvere commaunded, called for,<note place="margin">Robbed all Churches in <hi>Londō.</hi>

And so vvere cunningly all the Churches of London robbed on a daye. This vvas one of the last good vvorkes this Church-robber did. For in Ianuarie after he dyed an excommunicated person, vvhich excommunication vvas published by Pope Paule the 3. thus beganne the schisme in England.</p>
   <p>Then succeeded Edward the sixte, a childe, a boye of nine yeares of age, vvho continued the schisme, he had the title of supreame head immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly in earth vnder God, of the Church of England and Ierland.

her ovvne estate) to subiect her selfe to the Church of Rome, vvhich vvould neuer giue consent to graunt that the diuorce of Queene <hi>Catherine</hi> vvas lawfull; but contrarie approoued her marriage to be good, neither vvould allow that her Father King <hi>Henrie</hi> should haue tvvo vviues at once, and so consequently, disapprooued and annulled the Marriage of Queene <hi>Anne</hi> her mother, as illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. By vvhat motiues, or reason soeuer she vvas mooued, I knovv not, but it is certaine she reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and continued the schisme from the Mother Church, the Church of Rome.</p>
   <p>And King <hi>IAMES</hi> our Soueraigne, vvho novv by all right of succession raigneth, came into this Kingdome, not with sword, nor yet vvith gard of men;<note place="margin">K. <hi>IAMES</hi> maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the schisme.</note> but vvith a ryding rodde in his hande, in all peace, vvelcomed of all, receaued of al, and being a Protestant, so brought vppe from his Cradle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to maintaine the Religion hee here found, which he hath and doth performe.</p>

<pb facs="13"/>
Scripture, that Christ vvas true God consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and coequal vvith his Father and no vvaye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior as God, but as man only: so it is as manifest in scripture, that Christ promised to be vvith his Church vnto the end of the vvorld, and that hee vvould send the holy Ghost to his Apostles, and consequently to their successors, and that this Church should instruct and teach the people all truth, both in doctrine, maners, and in good life: And that S.

Wherefore as the Arrian heresie sought to destroye Christ, and Christian religion, in denying the Godhead of Christ; so Protestanisme, in seeking to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv the infaillabilitie of the Church, indeauour to disable Catholike faith and religion. And as the Arrians labored might and maine to infect the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and to make a Pope of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet fayled in the purpose. For Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> whom they promoted and preferred to the Papacie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them as heretikes, &amp; defined against them, and dyed a Martyr. O prouidence of God: yea they so afflicted the Church, that the most part of the vvorld vvas ouer-clouded and darkned vvith this filthie cloud of Arriā heresie: yet <hi>praeualebit veritas,</hi> truth preuaileth, insomuch that novv in the hartes of Christian, &amp; Catholike people, nothing is more odious then this heresie of the Arriās, &amp; by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants condemned to the pit of hel. So the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants haue labored <hi>omnibus vijs &amp; modis</hi> (but not able to make a Protestant Pope) yet to sovv this seede of Cockel and Darnel, that the Church of Rome may erre, that they haue infected and caused a great reuoult in these partes of Christendome▪ that almost all Almanie, and a great part of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,

   <p>If vve argue vvith the Protestants,<note place="margin">Protestant flye from antiquitie, traditions, and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church</note> to free the Church of Rome of imputation of error (as manie great Schollers haue vvritten many learned Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, concerning this poynt) and doe prooue by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, by practise of the Primatiue Church, by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from the Apostles, concerning those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Religion, controuerted betvvne the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and the Catholikes, they flye off and saye they are not demonstratiue arguments, to conuince in matters of doctrine, but only probable proofes.</p>

And as for the foure last generall Counsels (I vvill name the last first) the venerable Councell of Trent, the Councell of Florence, of Constance, and Lateran, the Protestants absolutely auerce, that they haue gone awrye, and were deceaued in the principles of faith and Religion,<note place="margin">A newe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

them, and defined their positions as hereticall. So did the Arrians in like maner instance against the Counsell of Nyce, for the same cause, because it defined against them.</p>
   <p>Wherefore in this Treatise vvee haue excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and thought vpon another course,<note place="margin">Only Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> to Vncase the Protestants, to laye open their contradictions, to alleadge their ovvne authorities and writers; to expresse the absurdities of their inferences and consequences, to see vvhither they vvill runne then.</p>
   <p>No doubt they vvill crye out, The Scriptures, the scriptures onely shall be our guyde, our Iudge, our gouernour, our vvarrant, in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. Although vvee know that some contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies cannot be decided by expresse scripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vvritten vvord, but vvee must haue our varrant from Tradition and the Church (which vve call the vnvvritten wordes) as for example the true number of the vvritten scriptures, are these and no more: the Baptisme of Children, &amp;c. Yet vve accept of this condition of tryall, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the true scripture to be the vvord of God, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it selfe, wherein no falshood can be hidden, the true tuchstone of trueth, dedicated by the Holie Ghost, vvritten by the Prophets, Euangelists and Apostles of Christ: therefore vvith all reuerence vvee reade it; and <hi>S. Charles Boromeus</hi> did so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently esteeme of the sacred scriptures, that vvhen he did seriously read them, he did alvvaies read them vpon his knees, and bare-headed: a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of pietie.</p>
   <p>Let vs vvillingly enter into the liste of this combate vvith Protestants or Puritants? We know vvhat vvill be the ende of this, for demanding of them before hand, vvhether they vvill be tryed by the bare letter of the word, or the true sence &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word? they wil answere by both. If vvee

aske hovv shall vvee knovv that vvee haue the true sence and meaning of the vvord: they vvill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere, that they vvill make this plaine, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of place vvith place, and that the spirit vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, doth tell them, this is the Trueth, and true sence and meaning. If vvee replie, vvee haue the spirit as vvell as you, vee conferre place vvith place as vvell as you: vvhere then vvill be the end of this controuersie? We must beleeue them vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their spirit, and the conference of places made by them, or else no end; so that their priuate spirite must end it, or no end at all.</p>
   <p>But to make an end at this time, I vvould aduise the young students to take this <hi>notandum</hi> and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat from me; not to be credulous to the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their doctors and Sages, but to read dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the authentike Authors, least that be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in you. <hi>Si coecus coecum ducat in foeueam cadent.</hi>
