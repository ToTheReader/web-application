   <head>TO THE HON. SIR EDWARD HOBY Knight.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may please you to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that my vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie sonne <hi>Theophilus Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> (within some foure yeares, or thereabouts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Master of Arts) would needs forgoe the Vniuersity, to go with my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> that now is, being then Elect Bishop of <hi>Glocester.</hi> And in regard of his yong yeares, I thought it verie vnfit; perswaded him, and commanded him to stay in the house, till he were better read in Diuinitie, and his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, &amp; in other things, better rectified, which I found to be verie defectiue. My Lord, for his part, very honorably told me, that he had perswaded him thereto, and would be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to do him good, as if his time were spent in his house, and after some two or three yeares would receiue him. No perswasiōs might serue,
<pb facs="64"/> but he importuned my Lord; so as from <hi>Oxford</hi> he went: though I had told him before M. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Schoole-master of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and M. <hi>Iles</hi> the Proctor, that (if he would not be ruled by me, and stay at <hi>Oxford</hi>) my hope of his well doing was at an end. When he had been lesse then two yeares with my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> (then Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi>) hee withdrew himselfe from his Lordship, and made suite for the Lecture at S. <hi>Dunstons:</hi> which I hearing of, perswaded him from, by my letters, in the best manner I could, for the reasons afore mentioned, and the rather, because I knew the Auditorie there to be verie learned and iudicious: no perswasion might draw him backe to his Lord and Master, though his Lordship wrote diuers letters to him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call him to his place.</p>
   <p>Afterwards a friend of mine told me, that he thought he was in hand to marrie: whereupon I wrote vnto him what I heard, and my counsel, aduice, and charge withall. His answere by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, that he was abused by the reporter, and protested that as he desired Gods blessing and mine, he neuer would marrie with any woman, before I had knowledge of his liking that way, and should giue approbation thereto: this was about Michaelmas, and he was maried in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine manner before Christmas following, whereof I neuer knew till after Midsommer terme following: and he vnderstanding that I had knowledge of it, and much grieued thereat,
<pb facs="64"/> eloyned himselfe from his wife, and kept in the North-parts till neere Hollontide. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>London</hi> (but not to his wife) there he published a small booke in print, flatly against the absurdities he now so strongly seemeth to maintaine: and within twentie daies after, at the most, got him beyond the Seas, leauing his wife in great distresse, sorow and griefe. Before his going he borrowed diuers summes of money, with purpose (I am perswaded) neuer to repay them: and amongst the rest, abused my selfe for ten pound. In May last past, I trauelled to Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> with a good friend of mine, to seeke him out: where finding him, I laboured earnestly to bring him backe with me, assured him of safetie, &amp;c. He promised, swore and protested his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after me to my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> within three weekes after my comming away; though I thinke he neuer meant it. Being in S. <hi>Omers,</hi> I willed and charged him, not to reueale my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; notwithstanding he made it knowne the same night to a Popish Priest, as vpon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he confessed to me the next morning: which made vs presently to come away, fearing our liues to be in danger amongst such a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of helhounds, as that towne is stuffed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Sir, I assure my selfe, and all men that well knew him may be perswaded, that his Poperie came from the discontentment, by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie mariage, wherin he dealt so perfidiously; and so it hath pleased God to punish that sinne
<pb facs="65"/> with many other sins. How carefully I brought him vp, and what meanes I vsed for his trayning vp in the truth of religion, and in good institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, God knoweth, and the world can witnes with me. If I had had abilitie to haue answered his leaud booke, I would gladly and speedily haue vndertaken it; but I am glad that one so Honorable, learned, worthie and wise, hath vouchsafed it. For my hope is, that the whole rabble of Papists shal vnderstād so much, by you, of the cause of his comming to their hotchpotch religion, that they will be ashamed any longer to patronize him, if they be not past all shame.</p>
   <p>So hauing troubled your Worship with a long, tedious relation, which commeth from a grieued heart (and the rather for that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie yong mans courses haue occasioned the death of his louing mother, my late deare wife) I craue pardon, and leaue the man and the matter to your wisedome, censure, and pleasure, and will euer rest,</p>
