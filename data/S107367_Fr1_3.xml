   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now many yeeres agoe, since
reading Historians, I fell upon
the sect and manners of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Saxons, who finally were
vanquished, and converted to
the Christian Faith, by the Armes and wisdome
of our <hi>Charlemaigne.</hi> I thereupon looked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
such Authors, as I could get; for besides
<hi>Crantzius, Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Viterbe, Regino,</hi>
who speake of those people. I read the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Fulde,</hi> the relations of <hi>Schaffenberge,
Evodius, Albinus,</hi> and other Records, from
whence I have drawne this History, illustrating
it with many admirable passages, extracted from
sundry Authors, to be presented to his Majesty
in the beginning of his conquests.</p>
   <p>At that time, having taken another flight,
and other imployments, I was diverted from
this labour, which I accounted as buried up,
had not a benigne hand drawne it out of its
<pb facs="6"/>
Tombe, esteeming it very fit to see day-light in
the goodly splendor of these times, and divine
Lustres of the Kings Triumphs.</p>
   <p>If the sound hereof seeme somewhat harsh and
rough, I beseech the vnderstanding Reader to
consider, that the most part of Histories, of the
same Time, are of no other condition; that this
subject was conceived upon an occasion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee ought more to regard the delights of a
Royall Theater, then a Method, dry, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vique;
Finally that there is nothing so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
which cannot be verified by the relation
of ancient Histories, and that he who will take
away the veile, shall see in the destruction of
Idolatry made by <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sects vnder the Armes of our most
Christian King, whom God for
his glory preserue, for the
good and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llitie
of his
people.</p>
