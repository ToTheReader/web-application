   <l>Of Eloquence, but clad in white and blacke;</l>
   <l>Thou must prepare thy selfe t'abide the showers,</l>
   <l>Of them that of dislike occasion take,</l>
   <l>And when thou likeliest art to go to wracke,</l>
   <l>Seeme not against them thine error to defend;</l>
   <l>But rather yeeld a little and giue backe,</l>
   <l>And pray them, that they will thy faults amend.</l>
