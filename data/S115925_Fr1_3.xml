   <head>TO THE VVHOLE NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
OF THE IRISH, BARNABE
RICH Souldiour, sendeth all kinde and
friendly salutations.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare friendes and Countrymen (for so I may
speak in generall without offence to any mans
greatnesse or exceptions taken at mine owne
vnworthynes) I haue yet once againe betaken
me to my penne to giue satisfaction if it will
be to those discontentmēts that haue bin wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and misconceiued against my booke. Doe not thinke that I
goe about to salue vpp matters with dissimulation for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
my selfe to bee the veryest bungler at this same flattery
that ere putt penne to paper, I coulde neuer dissemble clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and they say <hi>Qui nesciet dissimulare, nesciet viuere,</hi> he
shall be sure to get no friendes, and although friends in this age
are but like to an after game at <hi>Irishe</hi> that is both wone &amp; lost
with a cast yet these fewe that I haue I thank God are assured.</p>
   <p>Men are beleeued as they are beloued, and good counsayles
are accepted as the party is esteemed that aduiseth, whose mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
many times doth wipe away beleefe. Yet other whiles it
hath pleased God, to vse meane persons for the setting forth of
his glory. Hystoryes doe make mention of A Christian child
named <hi>Frumelius</hi> that being taken prisoner, and brought into
the furthermost part of <hi>East India,</hi> as he grewe in yeares, won
some of the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Christian faith, &amp; calling to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
some fewe Christian Marchantes, that were in those
partes, he erected a Church, and brought many <hi>Indians</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in Christ and to receiue Christendome. We reade the like
of the king of <hi>Iberia,</hi> who by the instructions of a Christian
woman, beleued in Christ himself &amp; caused all his people to
do the like. And what was your great saint <hi>Patricke,</hi> that you
<pb facs="4"/>
holde in such veneration, if there be any credite to be giuen to
your owne wryters, he kept hogges, and yet by Gods grace, &amp;
ordinance he was the first instrumēt that drew the Irish to the
christiā faith. But if it might haue passed for paiment in those
dayes, what you thinke to be currant now, that you wil beleeue
nothing but what your fathers haue beleeued before you, Saint
<hi>Patricke,</hi> had beene better to haue kept hogges still then to
haue spent his breath, to such a froward generation. But your
priests will beare you beleeue that you retayne the same faith
now that Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> first planted. Do not beleeue thē they
haue mocked you long, &amp; it would be ouer tedious in an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
to set downe how Rome it selfe is declined nay how it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
&amp; poluted, &amp; how the Pope with his whole Cleargy are
fallen from the sincerity of true religion to maintaine their own
traditiōs &amp; to set vp superstition &amp; idolatry, &amp; that within
these very few years &amp; whereof there are whole volumes extat
for breuityes sake I will here let slip to speake of Fryer <hi>Mantu
an,</hi> of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> of <hi>Platina,</hi> of <hi>Holcot</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Popes</hi> owne broode, that haue not onely exclaymed
against the pope himselfe but in like manner against his whole
cleargy. And <hi>Palingenius,</hi> an excelent author &amp; yet a Papist,
giueth this Item <hi>Let no Fryer, Monke, nor any Priest come
within thy doores▪</hi> I could wish that euery married man in
<hi>Ireland</hi> would be a little aduised by <hi>Palingenius</hi> to shut this
baudy broode out of there doores, for they haue euer more bine
a leacherous generation. These be they that be your sounders,
that haue had the guiding &amp; gouerning of your faith. These be
they that you beleeue and giue credite to, these be they that you
are perswaded their prayers will helpe you. And these be they
that do make deuotion a cloke for sedition that vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of sowing religiō do hope indeed, to reape rebelliō. O that
you could now but open your eyes to looke into this Romish Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie:
but I will no longer hold you with an <hi>Epistle</hi> but will
referre you to that which followeth.</p>
