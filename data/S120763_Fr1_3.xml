      </note> Reader, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, Worshipfull. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>TOuching these arguments following, my humble petition to the<note n="b)" place="margin">This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence vnto the <hi>Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> is because they wold not seeme to be petitioners vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Christian reader (of whatsoeuer sort and condition) is this, that they may not be taken as proceeding from one suspecting any religious Noble man or Gentleman of the Parliament house, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from one as with all thanks to God, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the godly forwardnesse of many in both houses, so also earnestly desiring to quicken the zeale of the best, and to provoke all other, to take the cause heere hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to heart, not onely as the cause of poore distressed men, but as the cause of God; yea to accompt it also the<note n="c)" place="margin">The Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants make the profession of the Gospell &amp; all Religion, to consist in refusing <hi>cap, surplice, crosse,</hi> &amp;c Great crie little wooll.</note> maine cause of the whole land, of your selues and all your posteritie, and therefore to preferre the same <hi>(according to the dayly most godly prayer of your selues, in your house of Parliament)</hi> before al other causes whatsoeuer, either concerning any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, or the whole common wealth.</p>
   <p>Whereas I haue perswaded them to whom I haue directed these reasons, to vse all meanes they may for the doing of any good; I desire that my wordes may not be vncharitablie construed, of any other
<hi>meanes</hi> then such, as are sutable to the <hi>cause,</hi> viz. of good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, lawfull, peaceable and agreeable to euery mans calling. The like charitable construction I craue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wordes, which some perhaps may malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrest against my selfe and the cause.</p>
   <p>Whereas also some may seeme to pretend feare of his most excellent Maiesties<note n="d)" place="margin">As if his Maiesty wold be
<hi>displeased,</hi> if any promoted a religious or honest cause. A malepert &amp; presumptuous <hi>(if not disloyal)</hi> Censure.</note> displeasure to hinder
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>their zeale and courage, such I intreat to consider, how dishonourable (if not disloyall) it is in good causes to feare the displeasure of a Prince, who besides his most Christian education from his infancy, hath<note n="e)" place="margin">I know not whereto all his whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth if the Suppliants deeme not his Maiesty to haue forsaken his first loue and to haue reuolted from Religion, at least in shevv for a time.</note> long time publikly giuen so many worthy testimonies of his piety and godlinesse. <hi>Loue thinketh no evill of any,</hi> much lesse of such a Christian Prince. <hi>It beleeueth all, and hopeth all of euery brother,</hi> much more of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King. <hi>It is the glory of a King</hi> not only <hi>to finde out the secrets of other,</hi> but also sometime to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his own. Therfore it is not meete by presēt words or deedes, (whereof sometime there may bee a deepe reason) alwaies to iudge of the mind. <hi>Iehu</hi> pretended one thing (when he proclaimed a sacrifice for <hi>Baal</hi>) but hee intended another:
<hi>Ioseph</hi> a long time dealt roughly (both in word and deede) with his brethren yet in the end he shewed himselfe most louing and kinde vnto them. Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> (for the triall of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>) seemed a long time to repel her sute, for her daughter, first by silence, <hi>2.</hi> by a sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of his disciples, petitioning in her behalfe: and <hi>3.</hi> by a more sharp answer to her selfe. At the last notwithstanding, he did most graciously open the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his rich compassion towards her, and sent her away with aboundant comfort. <hi>Constantius</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, lib. <hi>1. de vita Constantini,</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi>) at his first entrance into the Empire, made solemne proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all <hi>which</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>serued him in his court, should either worship Devills,</hi> (after the manner of the Heathen) <hi>or giue ouer their places of dignity and honour, and so to be banished from his court.</hi>
      <pb n="8" facs="6"/>
      <hi>But by this meanes when he had tryed them that were faithfull, then (to the farre greater honour of his Princely wisedome and piety, than if he had plainely and simply at the first professed the Christian religion) He disgraced those that had so reuolted from God, and rebuked them with a most Princely and religious rebuke, saying,</hi> That they were Traytors to GOD, and vnworthy the seruice of an Emperour. For how <hi>(quoth he)</hi> can they keepe faith vnuiolate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Emperour, which are manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to be vnfaithfull to the most excellent and mighty God.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>On the contrarie, those that for conscience had forsakē their places, and giuen ouer their honors, he most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graced,</hi> as those that would be faithfull to the Emperour, because they had beene so vnto God: yea, he pronounced them worthy to be reckoned among the chiefe and principall friends of the Emperour, and to be worthily much more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then Treasuryes full of great riches. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also he preferred some of them to speciall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon his owne person, and other some hee aduanced to the chiefe gouernement of the Empire vnder himselfe.</hi>

Onely I wish such consideration of them, that men may not bee rash (vpon any supposed apparences) to iudge Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, especially who in former times haue many wayes testified their sincere religion: yea I wish lesse censuring</hi>
