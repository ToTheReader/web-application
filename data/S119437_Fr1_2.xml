   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>AMong the many trials and troubles of the Churches of Christ, it is one of the greatest, when schismes and heresies arise among themselves. All other opposition and persecution of any adversaries without, is litle or nothing vnto it: neyther bringing such hinderance to the truth, nor being so heavie to the Church. But thus wil the Lord exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his people, and accomplish his owne work. And this have the Apostles foretolde, that it should be the case and estate of the Church, here on earth. <hi>Act. 20.28.29.30. 1 Cor. 11.18.19. 2 Pet. 2.1. 1 Ioh. 2.18, 19.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Of which cōmune lot and woonted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the CHƲRCH, wee for our part have had our portion and experience, many times and sundry wayes: And now of late (as sometimes also heretofore) by that which hath fallen out among vs, in such as have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the truth of Christ, and are seduced with the errour of the Anabaptists. A case woful and lamentable, in many respects: yet such as the Lord (I trust) who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thinges for the best to them that love him, will turn to great good, both for the truth it self, in the further clearing of it; &amp; for the Churches of Christ, in the more freing of
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> vs from the imputation of Anabaptistry, which hath most vniustly been laid vpon vs. And for a beginnning, behold the late A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists thēselves have now published some writings: which already cleare vs and the truth witnessed by vs, and are like to cause further manifestation of these &amp; other things by divers of vs.</p>
   <p>Wherefore (leaving the answer of the bookes which they have set forth, to such as are specially interessed and imployed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) I have thought good now to publish this treatise following: wherein are conteyned some grounds and reasons, written heretofore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their errours about Baptisme. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto if he that challengeth all, shall make answer directly to the reasons and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here set downe, I shall have occasion (as others already have) to write further and more particularly hereof, and by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God, to mainteyne this saith once given to the Saints, against any opposition or delusion he can bring thereabout.</p>
   <p>In the meane tyme, let one poynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them be well observed, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their writings make manifest y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> to the iudicious and indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: namely, that the grounds and assertions of their opinions are such, as pervert the Gospel of Jesus Christ; bereave the Church of the grace and favours of God to young and old; take away the comfort of Christian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; deprive kingdomes and cōmune wealthes of having Christian Kings Iudges and Magistrates (whatsoever they pretend to the cōtrary): &amp; do indeed very greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the good of all estates, domestical, civil, and ecclesiasticall. The more straunge it is, that yet notwithstanding they would write and cary themselves in such sort as they do, not fearing to fil their mouthes and pens with falsehood and blasphemie; with perverting the Scriptures, and abusing the people of God; with reproaching, and challenging of all such as stand against their errours and heresies: as if he that set forth such writings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed such challenges, would shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be another Goljath defying Israell, and provoking all to battel and combate.</p>
   <p>Which things J wish they may lay to heart, and feare before the Lord,<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.10.</note> who will cut off all the hornes of the wicked, and make the horns of the righteous to be exalted.
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> Examples whereof we have many, not onely in Goljath &amp; others throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in heathen stories and records also. As may be seen for a memorable particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in that very <hi>Tyrant,</hi> with whose <hi>wish</hi> this adversary patternes his owne. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom<note n="*" place="margin">Dion Cassius, lib. 59. in historia Caij Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulae.</note> it is recorded, that he reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but a few yeres, and then was killed, and they which were present at his death, calling to minde how he had wished <hi>that all the people had but one neck,</hi> shewed him <hi>that himself had but one neck, &amp; they had many hands.</hi> For God resisteth the proud, &amp; giveth grace to the humble. <hi>Prov. 3.34. Iam. 4.5.6. 1 Pet. 5.5.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Good therefore it were for these men, to consider their wayes in their hearts, to be low in their owne eyes, to humble themselues vnder the mighty hand of God, to turn their feet into the Lords testimonies which they have forsaken, and not to be caried about with everie wynd of doctrine by the deceipt of men, but to be more constant in the truth of Christ then hitherto they have bene. The consideratiō whereof I leave vnto themselves, and them vnto the Lord, who knoweth and will accomplish his owne work in all, to his owne glorie and praise in the end.</p>
   <pb n="7" facs="4"/>
   <p>Now for the treatise ensuing, which is but short, and printed for thy use, Christian Reader, let me exhort thee to ponder the reasons alleadged with thy self, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them by the Scriptures: and the Lord give thee vnderstanding in all things. Christ alone is to all his, <hi>the way, the truth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6</note>
      <hi>&amp; the life.</hi> The Lord stablish thee in the faith of his Gospell, that being rooted and built in him, with assurance that this is the true grace of God wherein we stand, thou mayest grow vp in grace and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, in whom the nations &amp; families of the earth are blessed, &amp; vnto whom be glorie both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</p>
