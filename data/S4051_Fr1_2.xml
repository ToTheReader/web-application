Sir William Russell,
Lord Russell, Baron of Thorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haugh,
yonger sonne to that most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable, as Iohn
the Baptist was in one desert,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note>
so our Sauiour Christ he was
in an other:<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.</note> but as these two
differed in their being in the
world: so did they not accord
in their being in the wildernesse. Iohn was with
some men, Christ with none; Iohn was with wild
men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Christ praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ
fighting; Iohn was feeding, Christ fasting; Iohn
was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels.
From Iohn preaching in the desert, learne we
<pb facs="3"/>
diligence in our callings: from Christ tempted
in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:
<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 34. 19</note> Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the
Lord deliuereth them out of all.</p>
   <p>If it please you to giue these after-lines the
reading, you shall see set downe that monoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
or single combat, which was hand to hand
betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for
Christ Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting,
conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he
was man: fighting &amp; encountring, to shew he was
Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall
see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obiecting,
that<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> Christ might despaire;<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> answering, that he
might presume; and<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 4. 11</note> flying, when he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome.</p>
   <p>In Christs temptations, we see the estate of
the<note n="e" place="margin">1. Pe. 2. 21</note> Church; in Satans assault, we see his malice
to the<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8</note> Church. Is Christ tempted? thinke it not
strange if we fall into<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20</note> tēptations. For the griefe
of the head, is the griefe of the<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 12▪ 26.</note> members: &amp; the
temptations of Christ, shew the temptations of
<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20▪</note> Christians. It is true of Christ, that<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 21</note> by many
tribulatiōs he did enter into the kingdom of God:
that<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10</note> our High Priest was consecrated by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that so he must suffer and enter into his
<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> glory.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
He is no sooner borne into the world, but he is
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 2. 14</note> hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16▪ 4. 1.</note> but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but
the<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 1.</note> Scribes proscribe him; to<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 11. 15.</note> worke miracles,
but the Pharisees slaunder him. He is no sooner
to suffer, but<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 27</note> the Diuell assaults him; apprehē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but the<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28</note> Iewes deliuer him; deliuered, but
<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 23. 11.</note> Herod derides him; derided, but<note n="h" place="margin">Luk 23. 24.</note> Pilate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
him; condemned, but the souldiers<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 27. 27.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
him. Is he on the crosse? the<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 27. 39.</note> people will not
pitie him: is he risen? the high Priests will<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 28. 15.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
him. In a word, is he vpon earth? he is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
in his<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 11. 16.</note> person; is he in heauen? he is<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 9. 4.</note> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his members. Thus the life of Christ was
a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians
must be a warfare vpon earth. We liue here in a
sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues
are calamities, the Church is the ship, the anker
is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the hauen is heauen, and Christ is our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.
When the sea can continue without waues,
the shippe without tossings, and passengers not
be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church
of God be without trials. We begin this voyage
so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on
till our dying day.</p>
   <p>We do reade in Gods word of many kinds of
temptations: <hi>God, Satan, Man,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>
the <hi>Flesh,</hi> are said to tempt. <hi>God</hi> tempteth man
to trie his obedience, <hi>Satan</hi> tempteth man to
make him disobedient: <hi>men</hi> do tempt men to try
what is in them: and <hi>man</hi> tempteth God, to trie
what is in him. The <hi>world</hi> is a tempter, to keepe
man from God: and the <hi>flesh</hi> is a tempter, to
bring man to the Diuell. So <hi>God</hi> tempted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 22. 1</note> in the offering of his son: <hi>Satan</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 1. 18</note> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Iob in the losse of his goods: a<note n="c" place="margin">1. King. 10. 1.</note>
      <hi>Queene</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
Salomon in trying his wisedome: <hi>men</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 17▪ 3.</note> tēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
God by distrust in the desert: the <hi>world</hi>
tempted Demas,<note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 10.</note> when he forsooke the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
and the <hi>flesh</hi> tempted Dauid,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sa. 11. 4</note> when he
fell by adulterie. Doth God tempt vs? take heed
of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of
his subtiltie: doth man tempt man? take heed of
dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of
inquiring: doth the world tempt man? take heed
of apostacie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed
of carnalitie. But do we so? are we warie of these
tempters? No, we are not, and therefore we fal.
We fal on the right hand, by temptations in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
and we fall on the left, by temptations
in aduersitie. Of the one it may be said, it hath
slaine<note n="g" place="margin">1. Sa. 18.</note> thousands: of the other, that it hath
slaine ten thousands.</p>
   <p>When we come and see cities dispeopled, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the
<pb facs="4"/>
souldier hath bene there: and when we see pride
in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne in
all, we may iustly say, the Tēpter hath bin there.</p>
   <p>Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God
to suffer his Church to be tempted with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael:
which is<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9</note> a reuiling tong: or the sword of
Esau, a<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> persecuting hand. Neither was there
yet euer Christian man found, who had not his
part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of
the<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> same cuppe our maister did:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 10. 24.</note> the disciple is
not aboue his maister.</p>
   <p>The reasons why God doth visit vs thus with
afflictions,<note place="margin">Reasons why God doth afflict his children▪</note> are: 1. To humble vs. 2. To weane
vs. 3. To winow vs. 4. To preuent vs. 5. To teach
vs. 6. To enlighten vs. 7. To honour vs. 8. To
cure vs. 9. To crowne vs. 10. To comfort vs.
11. To protect vs. 12. To adopt vs. And last of
all, to teach &amp; comfort others. To<note n="e" place="margin">Ec. 3. 10.</note> humble vs,
that we be not proud:<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119. 67.</note> to weane vs, that we loue
not this world:<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note> to winnow vs, that we be not
chaffe:<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> to preuent vs, that we do not sinne:<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 39. 9 40. 1.</note> to
teach vs, that we be patient in aduersitie: to<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 42. 21</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
vs, that we see our errors: to<note n="l" place="margin">Iam. 5. 11</note> honor vs,
that our faith may be manifest: to cure vs, that
we<note n="m" place="margin">Deu▪ 32 15.</note> surfet not of securitie: to<note n="n" place="margin">2. Tim 4. 7.</note> crowne vs, that
we may liue eternally: to<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 33</note> comfort vs, that he
may send his spirit:: to<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 12. 7</note> protect vs, that he may
<pb facs="5"/>
guide vs by his Angels: to<note n="a" place="margin">He. 12. 7.</note> adopt vs, that we may
be his sonnes:<note n="b" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 5</note> and to teach others, that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed
it be not found in them: that they<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 6</note> seeing our
comforts in troubles, may not be discouraged in
the like trials.</p>
   <p>Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre thē
sweet: his physicke is more aloes then honie: his
life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: &amp; his
death is more despised then honoured. This if
men would thinke of before, afflictions would be
as welcom to the soule of man, as<note n="d" place="margin">Ruth. 2. 8</note> afflicted Ruth
was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke
not for them before they come, think not on Gods
doing when they are come, and do desire to be
happie both here and hereafter: therfore we can
away with the name of Naomi, but in no case
would we be called<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth 1. 20.</note> Mara. We<note n="f" place="margin">Ion. 1. 15.</note> see the sea, not
the whale: the<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 14 11.</note> Egyptian, not the saluation: the
<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 6. 16 22.</note> Lions mouth, not him that stoppeth the Lions
mouth. If we could see God in our troubles, as<note n="i" place="margin">2. King. 6. 16.</note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha
did in his, then would we say: There are
more with vs, then there are against vs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not, therefore at euery assault of the
Assyrians, we say, as the seruant to<note n="k" place="margin">2. King. 6. 15.</note> Elishah did:
Alas maister, what shall we do? and with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
<note n="l" place="margin">Mar. 4. 38</note> Carest thou not maister that we perish?
Yet it is good for vs to suffer affliction.<note n="m" place="margin">Iam. 1. 12. Iob. 5. 17</note> Blessed is
<pb facs="5"/>
the man that endureth temptation: for when he
is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which
the Lord hath promised to thē that loue him. It
is<note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 3. 11</note> commanded by God,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note> practised by Christ,
<note n="c" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note> yeelded to by the Saints,<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> assigned by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
and good for vs each way. We are Gods
<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 1. 4.</note> trees, we shall grow better by pruning: Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
smell better by rubbing: Gods spice, be
more profitable by bruising: and Gods conduits,
we are the better by running. Let vs suffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
they are<note n="f" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 17.</note> momentanie in respect of time:
<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 1. 29</note> fauors, if we respect Gods loue, and a meanes to
bring vs to the kingdome of God. If they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
vs, we might wish them an end: but they do
purge vs, let vs be content. They<note n="h" place="margin">Act 14. 21. 1. Pet. 1. 5.</note> are Gods fan,
we are Gods wheate: they are Gods boulter, we
are Gods meale: they are Gods<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> flame, we are
Gods bush: they are Gods<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 22. 9.</note> cords, we are Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
they are Gods f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rnace, we are Gods gold.
The wheate will not be good without the fan, nor
the meale without the bolter, nor the bush with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the flame, nor the sacrifice without the cords,
nor the gold without the fornace: they are trials,
not punishments, if we be sons: punishments, not
trials, if we be slaues. Let vs then beare thē, they
<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note> will haue an end: ioy<note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 126. 5</note> will follow: they<note n="n" place="margin">Isa. 38. 10</note> shew vs
