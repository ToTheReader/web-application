as you forefathers were by orderly
vocation placed as Patrone and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour
to this vniuersite of <hi>Ingolstad,</hi>
sithen that also the right honorable
Prince Albert Duke of Bauaria hath
set me ouerseer and gouuerner of the same, it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
me long ere this time to haue offred vnto you
my seruice: especially hauing certain matters commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to my charge, whereof I should before this time
haue conferred with you. But whereas oure volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
deliberation by trouble of time was defeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
constrained, not as I would but as I was forced,
to yelde to necessite, and therefore must omitte the
one, and do the other: Yet in this busines to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
occupied, and in the principall by the waye to
be doing, I haue not suffred suche leasure as at times
happened, to passe withoute some frute of publicke
commodite. Whereof hauing longe thought, it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="15"/>
me, I coulde not by the waie more profitably be
doing then if (at what time other plaie or banquet) I
laboured vppon some such thing as might enforme
the poore deceaued people, and not offend rulers and
magistrats. And to this ende truly, these darke win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dayes as leasure serued me, I haue compiled this
booke, framing my stile after a rude and simple sorte,
that the vnlearned might vnderstande me, but letting
passe no iote of the truthe, to cure and remedy the
falshood. Although therefor the lerned by this booke
shall not perhaps be much instructed, yet the good
witte shall finde herein that is right worthy to be
knowen. and truly in medecines the wise Phisician
will not so much regarde that they be pleasaunt or
fayre to the eye as that they be holesome.</p>
   <p>This is therefor my meaning and the marke I shoo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
at,<note place="margin">The intēt of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in this vvor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke.</note> that the good people may be admonished of the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ir
saluation and aduertised of the daungerous decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of heretikes by whose crafte and guile we see the
noble Romain empire much weakened and empaired
euen nowe to fainte, and thousands of Christen sou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les
other where daily to perish. But the deceites of the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
heretikes being spredd so farre and so diuersly in
Christendom, that the vnlerned can not comprise
them and the lerned scant espie them, it shall be inou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe
for the people to lerne to knowe them selues to
be people, that is to vnderstande that it is ynough for
their parte to learne of the spirituall magistrat, howe
to do their duty to God, and of the ciuill or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
magistrat to learne their duty to their prince, and
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
in all thinges rather to lerne then to teache, rather to
obey then to commaunde.</p>
   <p>For these two estates the spirituall and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
haue of God him selfe ben ordained, duly rece<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aued
of vs, confirmed and established by lawes: and
haue serued vs as two walles by the which the power
of the Romain empire hath ben in Germany stayed
vp and continued all most these eight hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And truly as longe as matters appertaining to
God were by the spiritualty, and the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
by the temporalty gouuerned, and the lawes off
bothe estates ordained were inuiolatly obserued, thē
Germany might contend in wisedō with the grekes,
in stoutnes of courage with the Romanes, in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
with all Christen nations: then it mought mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
surely of vs then of the Romanes be saied.</p>
   <l>By auncient lawes and men doth stande</l>
   <l>Thestate of Germany and Allemain lande.</l>
   <p>Then it could, when lawes ruled men, not men the
lawes maintaine peace abrode, and reste at home: kepe
out their enemie valiantly and gouuerne their people
in all felicite.</p>
   <p>But Satan not abiding the repos of this countre,
stirred vp <hi>Martin Luther</hi> a German borne, pricked
him with furious rage: and draue him so forwarde,
that he ouerthrew all auncient lawes, by the which
this Empire hitherto hath staied and continued: and
placed for them newe by the which it should perishe
and fall. <hi>Luther</hi> iolted and enraged by this rider Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
began with a fury to set vpon the two saide wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb facs="16"/>
of the empire, and in shorte time, as well by his bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tering
the walles were sore beaten, as by the sounde
slepe of the rulers the warde and watche was forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
And that in such sorte, vntel one of the walles,
the Spiritualty, was vtterly ouerthrowen: the other,
the Temporalty, was put in greate hazarde: For so it
proueth in dede. when that (as the poete saieth)</p>
   <l>The sore dissembled doth fester and growe<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>or. 3.</note>
   </l>
   <l>While the idle shepeard taking his ease,</l>
   <l>Sercheth not spedely the wounde to knowe,</l>
   <l>But asketh the Gods to cure the desease.</l>
   <p>But this negligence being ones committed and done
it can not nowe be vndone: Yet although of thinges
past we haue the remembraunce only, consultation
or deliberation we haue none, truly I can not forget
with what a perpetuall ignominie and shame we are
to be noted, that coulde suffer a lewd frier, and that
neither craftely cladde in his shepes cote, neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
lerned, to worcke so foule and so pernicious
a mischef against all Christendom, that hauing first
all most ouerthrowen the Spiritualty, he hath so
shaken and weakened also the Temporalty, that it se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
rather already fallen downe then liekely to
fall.</p>
   <p>But what entry made Luther? Howe began he to
ouerthrowe these two estates? His beginning was
surely vaine and foolish, and stuffed all with lies.
<hi>The principles and growndes</hi> (saieth he) <hi>of the papistes are the
traditions of men not expressed in holy write, the pope of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
doubting and vncertainte of the grace of god.</hi> But who
<pb n="15" facs="16"/>
saieth this? Luther euery where. What witnes hath
he? Ihon Brentius in his booke <hi>of the causes of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
But howe proueth he it to be trewe? for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason forsothe but for that Luther is (as he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth)
an Euāgelist, and Brentius is an other S. Ihon. I
thinke the thirtenth Apostle. But as for these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or groundes, there was neuer Catholike that so
much as dreamed them. so farre is it that any man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
them or defended them.</p>
   <p>The true principles of Diuinite with vs are and
haue allwayes ben these.<note place="margin">The prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples of the catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> first <hi>the worde of God</hi> to wit
the doctrine of the prophets and the Apostles, and
brefely al the holy Scripture whiche we call the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The seconde principle is <hi>the right and Catholike sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
and vnderstanding of tbe worde of God</hi> deliuered by
the Apostles to their successours and by them spred
through the whole worlde, declared also in many
Councels of the holy fathers and brought in to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
For this Catholike exposition of the holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
bicause it was deliuered vnto the Apostles by
Christ him selfe, and by them left vnto their lawfull
successours with the very text of the scripture, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
it is cōmonly called the Tradition of the holy
fathers, and oftentimes, the vnwriten verite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the writen texte. And bicause the truthe off
the text and of the right vnderstanding of the texte
must nedes be all one, truly our aduersaries do slaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
vs, fayning that in triall off cōtrouersies we woul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
beside the worde of God sett as iudge the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men directly against the worde of God.
<pb facs="17"/>
The third principle is that <hi>holy continuall succession
of the See Apostolike and other bishops in the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che.</hi>
For if we be able to proue by order of continuall
succession that all bishops as well before vs as nowe
haue allwaies expounded the holy scriptures euen as
the first Apostles did, can there be any more certain
waye for the vnderstanding of scripture then this is?
I would gladly heare what can be saied against it.
The fourthe principle is <hi>the vnite and consent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
churche,</hi> Whereby it is made that the like truthe
be in euery part that is in the whole, and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise. These are (moste Reuerend Prelate) the right
principles of Christian doctrine: these are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of all truthe: these as foure quarres or corner
stones holde vp the Catholike churche: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called <hi>One, Holy, Catholike, and Apostolike chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che.</hi>
For of these principles dependeth the Authorite
of the councels. Of these the holy Canons haue the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
beginning: and of these, all laufull and laudable
rites of the church take force and strength.</p>
   <p>These then being the principles of our religion,
not those which <hi>Brentius</hi> falsely chargeth vs withal,
Princes and rulers ought to looke more nerer vnto
the doings and sayings of their preachers. But nowe
<hi>Bretius</hi> to make an oppositiō of the foresaide forged
principles, <hi>our principles are</hi> (saieth he) <hi>the worde of God,
Christ, and an assured certainte of oure confidence in Christ,</hi>
But what is I praie you, this your worde of God?
This it is, that all maner of folke, mē and womē, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and coblers, baudes and buchers, tinkers and tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="16" facs="17"/>
pedlers and poticaries, minstrels and mummers,
and all such like, be priestes, be bishops, be doctours,
and pastours, and haue authoritie to administrat the
Sacraments, to interpret Scripture, and what interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
eche one by the drifte of his braine draweth
out of scripture, that to be the pure ghospell off the
Lorde, and the expresse worde of God. This is not
(right Reuerend father) the worde of God, but the
worde of the diuell him selfe, inuēted of Luther, not
inspired by the sprit of God. For that man entending
to peruert all that appertained to God or to man,
laboured, trauailed and endeuoured by al meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible,
that there might remaine no spirituall magistrat
whiche might by authorite <hi>discerne betwene leper
and leper,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note> maintaining the right doctrine of the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
and remouing the bastard. And this labour of
Luther being well liked of Sathan, he imagined an
other worde of God, as <hi>that among Christen men shoulde
be no ciuill magistrat: for all princes were fooles tyrans and men
of no religion.</hi>
      <note place="margin">In his boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke de secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> to thentent that, if perhaps the heresies
of Luther were condemned by the Spirituall magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
and so forth with cōmitted to the secular sworde
princes therunto might haue no authorite. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<hi>he forbiddeth Christen men to kepe warre against the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In a boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke against the tvvo commaū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dements of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour.</note>
      <hi>and commaundeth subiects to rebel against their princes.</hi>
Strait vppon this arose an other worde of an other
God, that all lawes of chaste and single life shoulde
be taken awaye, teaching amonge a sorte of maydes
and yonge men that <hi>Man was no more able to refraine his
fleshly lustes then not to spet when nature prouoked.</hi>
      <note place="margin">In lib. de Matrimo.</note> Againe
<pb facs="18"/>
that <hi>fasting and abstinence from flesh nothing helped pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In libel. de matrimo.</note>
      <hi>nothing furdered deuotion made nothing to sobriete.</hi>
These smaller pointes being first all most conquered,
he reacheth to higher and diuiner matters. First bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he teacheth that <hi>sinne is not by the grace of baptime
taken away in dede,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In Assertiō ad Leonē.</note>
      <hi>but is saide and fained only to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
hereof he savve it vvolde folovve that <hi>mē oughte not
be estemed righteous and good in dede,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at Smalcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note>
      <hi>but onely accompted and
imputed for such.</hi> Then bycause he made no difference
nor degre of grace, he admitted no encrease in vertu,
and therefore could not abide the Sacramēt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
Fardermore bicause if sinne be not rooted
out if there be no encrease of grace nor goodnes, but
al is only by maner of accōpte and imputing, thē must
he also infer, <hi>that the presence of Christes body may not be in
earthe, that no sacrifice be admitted, and</hi> (vvhich folovved
thereupon) <hi>no priesthood nether.</hi> And of this point the
Zuinglians picked out one worde of their straunge
God and the Lutherās an other. of this spring also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
the doctrine teaching mā to be iustified by only
faith: hope, charite, repentaunce and other good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
being pernicious and hurtefull to saluation. what
frute then thinke you proceded hereof? This sothely
and many other.<note place="margin">Caluin in his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</note> For if God doth compell man
to sinne, as Luther and the Caluinistes do write, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
can God require good workes or by what lawe
can be punish sinne, seing that he worketh sinne in
vs, and good workes are thought to be pernicious?
And truly if there be no rewarde for vertu there shall
be no punishment for sinne. And then there is no hel
nor place of punishment: as in the seacoste townes
<pb n="17" facs="18"/>
of Germany it is taught: there is no diuell to execute
that punishment as Osiander teacheth.</p>
   <p>This worde not of God but of the diuell beyng
laied,<note place="margin">Abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans touching Christ.</note> this principle being put, an other principle con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning
Christ ensued: as that the humain nature of
Christe is god, as the Swenckfeldians will haue it, or
contrairely that Christe is not God as the Seruetians
teache and Mathias Flaccius,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> affirming that <hi>the worde</hi>
in the first of Iohn is not the sonne of God.</p>
   <p>Lo how fertill and abundant was this principle
of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Brentius.</hi> There were in times past and
are also nowe a dayes whiche openly denie Christ
to be the son of God: affirming him to be the son of
Ioseph and Mary. Which Mary also had (as they saye)
many other children beside Christ. Other there be
nowe which teache the ghospell of S. Iohn to be a
tale of Plato, baptim to be the inuentiō of the diuell.
And that there is not in God the Trinite of persons,
some other doubting whether this Trinite be man
or woman. So taught euen this winter a certayn new
ghospeller in <hi>Sternberg</hi> a towne of Morauia,<note place="margin">Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies cōcer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the Blessed Trinite.</note> and
that with the fauour of the people, but much against
the will of the Bishop of <hi>Omoluke</hi> their diocesian.
There be nowe in Hungary also, which in their bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tim
leaue out cleane the name of the Son. There be
in many places the Seruetians, which call the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinite by the name of the hellhownd Cerberus
whom the poetes fained to haue thre heads. With li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
horrible blasphemies two other ghospellers daily
preache, the one in the hilles of Gutni, the other in
<pb facs="19"/>
      <hi>Zary</hi> a village of <hi>Silesia.</hi> In <hi>Pintzou</hi> a towne of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone
<hi>George Brandat</hi> and <hi>Peter Statorius</hi> teache o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
that there is not one, but thre Gods, and eche
of them of diuers and distinct natures no lesse then
thre diuers men. So that there is not one substaunce
of the godhed but thre, and thre different operations
thre diuers willes. And that the Son is lesse then the
father. As for the crede of Athanasius that it ought
rather be called the crede of Sathanasius the diuell
him self. And these felowes <hi>Brandat</hi> and <hi>Statorius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admonished of such blasphemous doctrine, and
required by what authorite or whose persuasiō they
durste sowe suche blasphemies, they answered, they
were moued thereunto first by the authorite of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
of wolfgangus Musculus, of Peter Martyr of Bul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linger
and such like masters, then by the euidence of
the holy truthe, which hitherto hath layen hidd and
nowe was from God vnto them reueled: These thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
to be as we saye, <hi>Stanislaus</hi> a Baron of the realme
of Pole, <hi>Mathias Stadnitzky,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus Stanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
do write.</p>
   <p>But bicause this parted confusion of so diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
can not well be perceaued and is harde to be tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
or discerned of such as gladly receaue al nouelties,<note place="margin">Lutherās in Bohem teache the soule to die vvith the body.</note>
there is vpsterte this very winter in Bohem a newe
Secte. The which to take awaye this confusion, and
to sett forthe a brefe and compendiouse waie of the
Lutheran doctrine, teacheth openly and affirmeth,
<hi>that all other opinions and doctrine of God, of the
<pb n="18" facs="19"/>
worshipping of God, of faith, of good or euill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and to be short of any saluation of man, be but

reporteth) then surely vncertainte and wauering

may clerely gather howe trew this thirde principle
of Luther is: for such is the certaynte of their faithe

are the principles of the reformed ghospell laied by
Luther, repeted by Brētius, and admitted of the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
swarme of sectaries. Nowe bicause in the principle
all is contained and many labels depend thereof,
what roufe thinke yow will the diuell buyld vppon
these foundations of Luther? For the effect neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celleth

Herein therefore the greatest point of our debate cōsi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steth
whē the Catholike shal interpret holy scripture

then the Catholike, to knowe which of these

the ende must nedes be, that they be iudged to

the more receaued interpretation, which are able eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to showe their interpretation alleaged to be
Catholike and Apostolicall, that is, to haue proceded
from the Apostles, to haue ben receaued of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,

succession, and spred through the whole corps of

alleaged the false and bastard interpretation of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly

   <p>As for example.<note place="margin">A clere ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample off debating a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy.</note> Let vs suppose, that now in the

<pb facs="24"/>
truly not in the text but in the right vnderstanding of
the text. Not in that which is spokē but in that which
is ment. Is not this I praie you agreable to the worde
of God? standeth it not with all reason, that the same
interpretation and vnderstanding of an alleaged text
be iudged right and lawful, which can euidētly be pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
to haue ben deriued from the Apostles and so re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued
and vsed in the whole corps of Christēdom? I
verely can imagin no better. And with this my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt,
agreeth wel that Noble and wise Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius,</hi>
the first, who in this very question of vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
chose for iudge in that controuersie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholike
and receaued interpretatiō of holy scripture.
For thus we reade in the ecclesiastical historie of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
of one <hi>Sisinnius</hi> who gaue the Emperour this
councell to aswage the greate contentions that were
then in the church, through that heresie of <hi>Arrius.</hi>
This <hi>Sisinius</hi> was,<note place="margin">Socrates. li. 5. cap. 10. Sozomenus li. a. ca. 17 Nicephor. libro. 12. Cap. 15.</note> as <hi>Socrates</hi> writeth, an eloquent mā,
a man of much experience, very well sene in the olde
writers expounding holy scripture and a good philo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sopher.
This man therefore perceauing that by dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations
and conferences with heretikes, the schisme
grewe on more, and wexed more cōtentious, he adui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Nectarius</hi> then Patriarche of Constantinople in
this maner. <hi>The olde writers</hi> (saieth he) <hi>teache all waies the
Son to be coeternall with the father, wherefore they neuer
would affirme that the Son had any beginning of substance.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Good Counsell of Sifini{us} to defeate heretiker.</note>
      <hi>Let vs thē leaue these Logicall disputations, and looke vnto
the expositiōs of the olde writers. Put it therfore in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
head that he cal the heretikes before him and aske thē
<pb n="22" facs="24"/>
what accōpt they make of such doctours and fathers, as wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
before their heresie began: and whether they iudge them to
be Christen men or none of the church. If they mislike thē, let
them (if they dare) condemne and anathematise them. If they
so do, the very people will ouerrunne them. And so truthe
shall ouer come. But yf they do not repell the olde doctours, it
shall thē be our part to bring forth their sayengs, and by their
testimonies confirme our doctrine.</hi> This being tolde of
<hi>Sisinius, Nectarius</hi> goeth forth with vnto the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
and declareth vnto the Emperour the aduise off
Sisinius. who liking it very well, and going wisely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
the matter, called the heretikes before him, and
dissembling his purpose demanded them only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they made any accompt of the Doctours of the
church which liued before their heresie began or no.
They not reiecting those writers but calling them
their masters and fathers, the Emperour asketh them
againe whether they woulde admit them as worthy
witnesses of the Christen faith. The chief masters
of that heresie, hearing those wordes, doubted much
what they might answer. Whereuppon they striued
amonge them selues, some thinking the Emperour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
wel, some mistrusting the issue of his demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and perceauing they made litle for their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
For they were not all of one minde touching the
writinges of the olde fathers, differing in that point
not only from other religions, but also from them sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
who professed all one religion. Thus their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
doctrine was discouered and confounded, as the
buylders of Babel by their variaunce in language. For
<pb facs="25"/>
the emperour preceauing their disagrement, and seing
they trusted only vpon contentious disputing, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not the exposition of olde writers,<note place="margin">Olde here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tikes dispi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers as our protestāts novv.</note> he toke an
otherwaie with them commaunding that eche reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should in writing shortly comprise the effect of
their doctrine and opinion. Thus farre the history of
Socrates. That Sisinius though good not to dispute
with heretikes, it was not his first deuise. The holy
canons had commaunded the same.<note place="margin">In pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</note> Tertullian and
other holy fathers had writen the same.</p>
   <p>And the cause why they thinke it not expedient
to trie by disputation matters of our faith is,<note place="margin">vvhy it be houeth not to dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute vvith heretikes.</note> that all
heretikes do vtterly take away the true principles off
Christen religion, which are the sure groundes off
good disputation, and place in their stede false and
forged which are all vncertain: and maye serue (as we
see in coūting) sometime for more, sometime for les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
sometime nothing at all. For he that taketh away
the generall and the whole, howe can he be sure of
the partes? Or if ye denie the substance, to what
purpose were it to dispute of the accident? To none
at all. Therefore he that listeth dialectically and scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
like to reason with an heretike, if he agree not first
with him for the principles, he shall fight he woteth
not against what, nor to what purpose. and sooner
shall ye take a hare with a taburin then conclude
a suttell heretike with an argument. For he hath no
certainte in his doctrine: but is ready to denie that he
graunted the last worde before, and likewise to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unte
that he laste denied flitting and flieng as vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="23" facs="25"/>
serueth.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Brentius</hi> affirmeth the only text of the writen
worde to be the first principle of Lutheran religion.
But in such sorte that it may be lawfull out of this
writen text to cut of the epistle of S. Iames,<note place="margin">Vide praefa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiones Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri in hos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>libros pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae editio.</note> cast awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
the epistle to the Hebrews, refuse the Apocalypse
of S. Ihon, and condemne the bookes of Machabes.
This principle serueth also to reiect any other part of
the whole Bible. for if any sentence euidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in sctipture be brought against him, strayte
<hi>Brentius</hi> crieth. The Hebrewe text readeth not so.
The greke copies haue otherwise. And this principle
of the only text serueth so fit for these heretikes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that for conference with them no waye can be
made, nor ende can be founde. Then the Catholike
and Apostolicall vnderstanding of holy Scripture
which is euery where one and allwaies agreable with
it selfe, which is deriued from the Apostles, which
is the present iudge in all controuersies, they vtterly
refuse, and very rudely and impudently appeale vnto
Christ, whom in earthe present iudge we can not
haue.<note place="margin">In Bohem and in the seacost tovvnes of germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny.</note> Whom yet some of them denie to be God, some
to be man, and some other saie he is but a tale of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And yet forsothe they boaste of the certainte of
their faith, which in dede is most vncertain, as their
most manifest dissension well declareth.</p>
   <p>A very vaine and childish crake it is, to crie allwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies
that their Cōfession of Augspurg is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the doctrine of the prophetes and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
For who saieth so, but they them selues and of
<pb facs="26"/>
their only fecte, which first inuented it and would
impudently compel all Christendō to receaue it? But
if you ask them howe they proue it, they will saie
vnto you, <hi>All the articles of our Confession agree
with the prophets and the Apostles, and differ frō
thence in no point.</hi> O the madnes of our countre.
That which is called in question, they laie for their
groūdes, bringing for proufe that which ought to be
proued. What child in logick would so fondly reason?
For if you denie againe that the articles of this their
confession is grounded vpon the doctrine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and the Apostles, what haue they then to saye?
peraduenture left they may seme to be put to silence
they will beginne to interpret and cōfer Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
after their maner. But is not this the foule fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
in logike called <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> that is, to aske that
whiche ought to be proued? For when we blame the
Cōfessiō of Augspurg we blame nothing els but the
false and wronge interpretation of holy Scripture v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that Confession. But you will saye. We may as
well refuse the interpretation that the Catholikes do
bringe of their owne. Well truly and worthely. For
who will heare the Catholike doctour if he bring
forthe nothing, but saie only that the doctrine of the
Catholike churche is grounded in holy Scriptures?
This must not be tolde but be proued.</p>
   <p>What then will the Catholike bring that the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
shall not be able to bring? He will surely bring
and declare first the interprerarion of Scripture which
<pb n="24" facs="26"/>
he vseth to be vniuersall, to haue ben deriued from
the Apostles, to be receaued and allowed in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.
Then he will showe that euery article and
principall point of our faith hath ben confirmed by
miracles. Last of all he will teache you that all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Catholike church, which be proper of the
newe testament, are founde expressed by euident fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in the olde Testament:<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholikes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</note> What difference then
is there betwene the right Catholike and the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
heretike? Truly herein heretikes agree with the
Catholikes, that bothe embrace, alleage, and defend
holy scripture as the very worde of God, hut herein
differ all heretikes from the Catholikes, that these
bring the Catholike and vniuersall interpretation of
holy scripture, they bring their owne priuat and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikall.
These are able to proue their doctrine by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they are neuer able: Last of all, that these are able
to showe the matter of the newe Testament by the
figures of the olde lawe (as in the sacrifice, in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>cra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments,
and ceremonies) they can not.</p>
   <p>These two different waies being by iust balances
indifferently pondered, and tried, it will soone appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
whiche ouerwaieth the other. And in dede if they
bereue vs of the common and receaued iudgement
of the whole churche, wherewith all thinges in the
church are iudged, why may they not in like maner
take away all the rest? For as if ye plucked out a mans
eyes and yet wolde saie that ye bereued him not of
that which might be sene, euen so it is, if heretikes
graunt vs the text of the bible and yet take from vs
<pb facs="27"/>
the true vnderstanding thereof. If it forceth not
whether we vnderstand holy Scripture rightly or
no, howe shall we then discerne fashood from the
truthe? Whereby shall we trie the truthe, or what iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement

For these therefore and other waighty considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

If I mought be credited or beare any authorite amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge

which as it is oppressed by silence, so being discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
taketh force againe. I had rather therefore, if I
must nedes somewaies offend, smarte for telling the
truthe, then for dissembling by flattery. Therefore iff
I declare that which I haue perceaued, if I aduertise
men to beware of the mischef that I haue incurred
my selfe, I trust in so doing I shall offend no man. I
knowe there are amonge the rulers and noble men,
which if they plainly perceaued the deceites of these
heretikes, and knew what mischef ariseth thereby to
them selues, to theirs, and to the whole common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
they would not slowly and slackely as I did very

   <p>Therefore writing this booke (most Reuerend)
I haue eftesoones ioyned teares with praiers bese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
