   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a time</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>for all things.</hi> God hath his time neuer limited; and yet in respect of the execution of his will, he hath his time too, as we see lately by wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. What this age hath seene were enough to make a heathenish Atheist a Christian, and a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Christian, a Saint. But examples nor mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles can make men wise, without grace: that which mollified the <hi>Isralites,</hi> hardned the <hi>Egiptians.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Since all things haue their time, there is a time for thankefull acknowledgment, aswell as of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate vse. That God who made your Maiestie a meanes for my protection against the torrent of violent greatnes, makes me now a trumpet of your praise, and giues me a time (with some securitie) to sing the songs of Syon vnder the shelter of your gratious acceptance.</p>
   <p>The last of these Sermons is the first that euer I
<pb facs="3"/>
preached before his Maiestie, when I was sworne his Chaplaine. The first is that Sermon for which I was calld in question, and in defence whereof whilst you stood, a great affront was giuen you by an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall opposite; so that I seemed not to suffer for it alone, but your Maiestie with me. I haue now sent it to your Highnes, that you may see wherein it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued so many great exceptions, or I for it so strict <note place="margin">Amos 7. v. 12. 13.</note> a censure. The counsell it giues is plaine, but true. As it hath no rellish of Italian Courtship or Craft, so neither hath it any touch of <hi>Romish poyson:</hi> but proceeds from the simplicitie of Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which teacheth a foolishnes wherewithall to ouerthrow the wisdome of all <hi>Machiauelists.</hi> This is <hi>vpright and honest Truth</hi> which makes the <hi>Christian</hi> an euerlasting <hi>Politician;</hi> for the gates of hell shall not preuaile against him to his destruction, nor Uphold <hi>Doeg, Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> in prosperitie. To the patron of this <hi>Truth</hi> I commend your Maiestie in my daily prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and my owne innocencie I commend to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie my most gratious Patronesse,</p>
